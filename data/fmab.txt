Elizabeth! Hey!
Elizabeth!
I'm not supposed to tell anyone this, but according to Barry,
the Colonel is trying to expose the people in the military involved in that Lab 5 place.
Research Laboratory 5...
Al...
I have to go.
I might find out something aboutthe person who killed Mr. Hughes.
Hey, hang on! What about the secret to your body?
I'll tell you when I get back.
What's up with that?!
Well, I'm off.
Make sure you come back.
Yes. I promise.
Episode 19, Death of the Undying.
Done already?
Can I eat you now?
Shut up, you're in the way!
Lieutenant!
Out of bullets? Out of bullets?
Then it's time for dinner!
Looks like I made it in time.
Colonel...
Why did you come?!
Despite whatever may have happened to us, if you had just ignored it, you could have escaped suspicion!
And yet, you came out here?!
Seriously, are you an idiot?!
Okay, okay. I'm an idiot.
What the hell was that guy...
Colonel! Our target is on the run!
Sergeant, pull out!
Don't leave a trace!
Hayate, you stay with the Sergeant!
Yes, sir!
Colonel.
What is it?
Thank you.
Save it for later. We're in the middle of an operation.
Yes, sir.
Get in!
Yes, sir.
This has something to do with Mr. Hughes, right?
Do you want to come?
Yes.
Don't lose sight of him!
I won't let him get away!
My soul keeps shaking...
It's telling me where he is!
I wonder if other monsters like that fat one are going to show up?
I don't know. What the hell 
I hit his vitals many times,but it didn't seem to bother him at all.
Did he have a tattoo of Ouroboros?
Tattoo?
Oh, maybe that thing...
He had something on his tongue.
That's probably a homunculus.
That was close, idiot!
Wait, wait, wait! A homunculus?!
There's no way something like that could exist!
I met a homunculus by the name of Greed in the south.
And this is what he said.
"There's no way there's no way."
Homunculi have extraordinary regeneration abilities.
Greed had half of his head blown off, but he fixed himself right away.
But I guess that's hard to believe, huh...
We'll just have to believe you after seeing that thing.
You're not going to tell me he's still alive after being burnt to a crisp and falling from the top of the tower, are you?
Probably.
What is this... a nonsensical mutant all-around freak show?!
My body escaped into here.
Research Laboratory 3, huh?
Now we have a chance to blackmail the upper echelon.
That's sufficient for this operation.
We're withdrawing.
No, it's not!
No! Idiot!
This is bad, Colonel.
No, it's actually convenient.
What?
Outta the way!
I'm not interested in your meat!
Where are you, my meat?!
All personnel are to evacuate immediately!
C-Colonel!
The intruder is a vicious criminal.
Leave his capture to us.
The guards are to seal off all entrances!
Yes, sir!
That damn Barry... which way did he go?
We're splitting up.
Roger.
Looks like it's been quite some time since this place was abandoned.
Could it be... an experiment room?
If that were true, it doesn't seem any pleasant experiments were carried out here.
Oh my, what a coincidence.
I can't believe you stood me up.
You know, I was waiting for you.
I wanted to see you, Jean.
Solaris...
Why are you here?
Hey Havoc, she's got a tattoo of Ouroboros!
I just noticed that, myself!
Sorry for tricking you.
Well, I can see how you were tricked.
You like big breasts, don't you?
Yes! You bet I do!
...I do! ...I do! ...I do!
Did you tell her anything?
I didn't tell her anything related to my work!
Do you know Maes Hughes?
He was a handsome, smart man.
It's a pity I couldn't finish him off-
Get on your knees!
Tell me everything you know.
That's impossible.
You boys can't make me kneel-
As expected from the hero of Ishbal.
You're relentless.
H-Homunculus?!
Oh my, looks like you did your homework, Jean.
As a reward, I'll show you.
Do you see it?
It's a philosopher's stone.
Humans created with this stone as their core...
That's what we, homunculi, are.
You monsters!
How rude.
We have feelings and love for our parents.
We're...
...human.
If you're telling us your huge secret,you must not be planning on letting us go alive.
Yes, unfortunately for you.
Too slow!
Oh my, you can't even make your fire now.
What do we do now?! At this rate, we'll get tortured to death!
No, it's actually convenient.
If there's a lot of water...
...I just have to decompose it to create hydrogen and oxygen!
Geez, just look at this thing...
I got it from my ex, too...
Damnit!
Colonel, could you give me a light?
I guess it's impossible.
What am I, a wet match?!
That woman definitely burned up.
How can you tell?
By the smell.
I'm used to the smell of burnt corpses.
From Ishbal?
But we can't take her regeneration ability lightly.
Stay alert.
Roger.
Havoc!
Havoc, hang in there!
It's no use.
You can't save him anymore.
No!
It's pointless!
It'll take more than that to kill me!
I can save him with this!
I'm going to use it to treat him.
Medical alchemy isn't my specialty,
but if I boost my ability with this stone...
It's not very gentlemanly of you to suddenly stick your hand into a lady's chest.
F-FÃ¼hrer President!
An intruder?
Yes, sir! The culprit who attacked the western district jail is inside!
Colonel Mustang is after him!
I think I'll lend him a hand.
We'll come with you, too, sir!
No.
I'll be fine on my own.
I thought I told you.
The philosopher's stone is my core.
I'm sorry.
You're a candidate for sacrifice,
but you're going to die here.
You bitch...
Why don't you die as you lay there, watching your man go cold?
Second Lieutenant Havoc...
Answer me... damnit...
I'm not going to allow you to die before me...
Havoc...
You sure took your time, lady.
Just look how rotten my body has become.
It's impossible to place a soul on a body that doesn't belong.
If separate souls and bodies can't be mixed,
then I, who am made of a human soul and an iron body...
That's right, there's no guarantee this body will last to the time we fulfill our goal...
Brother...
There you are, Miss Lust.
Number 66, why did you join forces with the Colonel?
Because it seemed like it'd be fun!
And also...
...I want to cut you up, more than anything!
What a troublesome man.
And the armor boy, too? What are you doing here?
What a loss.
That I have to kill two candidates for sacrifice in one night!
Sacrifice? Two?
Yes. You and someone else.
What are you blabbering on for, Miss Lust?!
I hate persistent guys.
Now, Lieutenant. I'll send you to the place where I sent your superior right away.
Wait...
You said two sacrifices in one night, right...
Don't tell me... you didn't...
Y...You bitch!!!
Finished?
You humans really are foolish, weak, pitiful beings.
Lieutenant, get up and run.
Do you want to die first?
I see... so you opened the gate.
It's a shame.
Forget candidate, you're a confirmed sacrifice.
Alphonse, leave me and run.
No.
Run!
No!
Save yourself, at least!
I said, no!!!
Seeing people die before my eyes...
I hate it! I'm tired of it!
I'm not going to let anyone die anymore! I'll protect you!
Well said, Alphonse Elric!
You finally got down on your knees.
Using flint as the starter, and magnifying it witha transmutation circle made of your own blood...
How can you even move with that wound?!
I sealed it with fire!
Although I almost fainted a few times.
You said, "It'll take more than that to kill me", right?
Then I'll just keep killing you until you die!
Colonel!
I lost.
It's a shame, but it doesn't feeltoo bad to be killed by a man like you.
With honest eyes with no hesitation.
I can't wait...
The days when those eyes will show anguish...
...are... close...
Colonel!
You were all right...
Please worry about yourself!
Alphonse, you have my gratitude for protecting my subordinate.
Forget that! We need a doctor!
That's right... Please... hurry and have a doctor see Havoc...
He'll be all right... he'll be all right...
Hey... I'm back.
Idiot! Welcome back!
W-Well...
U-Umm... Where to start...
Umm...
It broke off!
Oh no! I can't fix this!
Dear me, I barely managed to survive...
...but in a form like this...
I wonder if someone can't fix me up...
Whoa! You were still alive?!
H-Hey... stop! What are you doing?!
I still haven't killed enough!
S... Wait! Wait! Wait! Wait! W-Wait!
S-S-S-Stop!
No way...
Impossible...
Hohenheim!
The truth revealed both of his emotions: joy, and unhappiness.
When the boy had to take a stand against the past he threw away,
what he had been hiding behind his resolve was exposed.
Next time, Fullmetal Alchemist:
Episode 20, Father in Front of the Grave.
It is possible to cry without tears.
If you're a human.





























Episode 23, The Girl on the Battlefield.
A smoke bomb and a grenade.
That brat sure is reckless.
Can you track them by scent?
Yeah.
Hey, MP.
Please take her somewhere safe.
Winry, Al's still fighting, so...
I'm going to go.
Sorry.
I'll tell you everything when I get back.
How come... all I can ever do is wait?
We've taken a girl under protection at 8th District, San Louis Street.
Apparently, she's a close friend of the Fullmetal Alchemist.
Escort her to Central Headquarters.
I repeat.
We've taken a girl under protection at 8th District, San Louis Street.
Apparently, she's a close friend of the Fullmetal Alchemist.
I guess it's about time.
Escort her to Central Headquarters.
Go provide them support.
Roger.
There's a vacant house on the outskirts of town we can use.
Let's meet up here.
Make sure no one follows you.
Yes, sir.
I'll contact you if we make progress.
All right.
You can't come to the scene.
I know, I know...
So persistent!
I'm being driven into a part of town without anyone around...
Did I fall for their trap?!
Was that Scar?
You take care of the other one.
I'll put an end to those two.
My left arm is...
What's wrong?!
Young master!
I can no longer be of any use to you!
What are you saying?!
If you take me with you, you may fall victim, as well...
Without his people, there is no king.
But without their king, the people have no place to go.
You must survive, for the sake of our clan...
I won't leave you!
There are plenty of things worth throwing away for a great cause.
Lan Fan?! What are you planning?!
Don't do it!
There's nothing inside your armor, right?
How pitiful!
You continue to believe in alchemyeven after being placed in that miserable state?!
This body comes with many inconveniences.
But inconveniences don't make me miserable!
There's no reason for you to pity me!
My life was put back together with alchemy by my brother.
If I deny myself, that would meanI'm denying brother, along with alchemy.
I believe in the potential alchemy holds.
I want to believe in it!
I see.
Brother!
What about Winry?
She's fine.
I'm such an idiot.
I made her cry again.
You're always so careless.
She saw us all covered in blood, too.
Yeah.
All right, time for act two!
Found you!!!
The Ishbalan!
You're...
That tattoo!
A homunculus!
Ling!
Run!
Get me a sturdy wire!
R-Right!
The fact your regeneration ability is so powerful became your downfall!
Your own meat that expands from within the wire will end up binding you tighter!
Got you, homunculus!
Well played.
I outwitted you, monster!
What? A homunculus?
Get him on!
We're making a run for it!
Hey, wait a minute Lieute-
H-Hang on!
Al!
The military police are watching.
Pretend like you don't know them.
They ran!
Capture Scar!
Yes, sir!
The Colonel isn't the nicest guy around, but he's trustworthy.
But more importantly...
We need to capture Scar, Al!
Right!
Multiple crimes, including the murder of the Rockbells!
You'll pay for those crimes!
Are you all right, Mister Servant?
How dare you do something like this to the servant of my savior, Yoki!
You pipsqueak!
What did you say?! Speak for yourself!
Who is that child?!
Little girl, get away from him!
It's dangerous!
We're far outnumbered...
We ought to retreat!
Just what the hell was that alchemy?!
She performed transmutations from a distance?!
This way.
Dammit, I can't see a thing!
Scar!!!
I've already heard about you, Ling Yao.
We're heading straight to our hideout.
Wait! I left a comrade. Pick her up for me!
Huh?
No, we don't have time!
I'm begging you! She's in critical condition!
She's waiting for me to come and get her!
Make it quick.
If I recall, that woman is Mustang's...
You've gone and done it now, youngster.
So even I had those eyes...
No matter how far along we've come,hatred only brings about more hatred...
That should have stopped the bleeding.
Thanks.
Master!
The military police are just around the corner!
We should run...
Our target is injured!
He couldn't have gotten far!
Search thoroughly!
Yes, sir!
Master!
Hurry! Hurry!
Shao May, we have to-
Huh?
I found something.
You! Is this really the time to be picking stuff up?!
But it was all alone in the midst of that!
You always do this!
You once picked up a stray cat and raised it inside your armor without telling me!
Get rid of that thing!
You're horrible!
Look how tame it is!
It's okay. Relax.
Please. This way.
Thanks.
Stay inside, okay?
Winry!
How's it going, Fullmetal Alchemist?
FÃ¼hrer President Bradley.
Why are you...
I heard your childhood friend was under guard here.
She's a person close to one of my valued, talented alchemists.
I have to treat her courteously.
Well then, young lady, I'll be taking my leave.
Okay. Thanks for everything.
She's a good, honest girl.
Treat her with care, okay?
Ed.
You promised.
Tell me everything you know about Mom and Dad.
I see...
So they were doing their best to help people until the very end...
But...
...I still wish they could have come back alive...
All I can do... is wait.
Oh, perfect timing!
There's a call for Miss Rockbell.
For me?
Hello?
Mr. Garfiel?
Sorry, Winry.
I was hoping to take care of everything myself, but...
Is Winry still not back?!
Look at this! Only Winry can fix this!
Your customers really miss you!
Please come back soon, Winry!
Winry?
Tetsu?
Please, come back soon!
My foot feels so much better when you operate on it rather than Mr. Garfiel!
Winry, I need you to finish off the exterior for my leg as soon as possible!
My arm, too!
No, I'm first!
I want to see you soon!
You idiot, Winry belongs to everybody!
That's right!
Sorry... I'll be back soon.
Please wait for me.
I'll do... I'll do my best...
Thanks.
Thanks for stopping me back then.
There are people who are waiting for me.
I was close to doing something that would make me unable to face them.
Winry...
Ed, don't forget to maintain your automail!
Y-You got it!
I'll send you some good polishing oil sometime, Al.
Okay!
Please don't die.
We won't.
Got it.
Next time I make you-
Huh? What?
I can't hear you.
Brother?
Wait!
Bye, Winry.
O-Okay.
Geez...
Hey, Ed!
What did you say?!
Next time I make you cry, it'll be with tears of joy!
Al and I will get our bodies back for sure, and we'll make you cry tears of joy!
You'd better remember!
Give me an arm and a leg.
One year.
We have no place to return now.
Why are 
Oh, I get it...
I... fell in love with him...
Colonel!
Get in.
There's someone seriously wounded.
We need a doctor.
Doing dangerous things again?
You stupid brat.
If I recall, you have family.
If it'll cause trouble, you don't have to do it.
I'll go bring some instruments, so hang tight.
Is it okay?
I divorced my wife soon after I came back from Ishbal.
You walked in the sewers with your arm cut off?!
I wouldn't be surprised if you got tetanus!
I've only dealt with corpses lately.
So I may be a bit rough.
I'm sorry...
Don't get the wrong idea.
We're the ones who offered to help.
We only worked with you guys because we had a common interest.
I'm seeking something so great as immortality.
I was prepared for the worst when I left my country.
No... I wasn't prepared enough.
Lan Fan was more prepared than I was.
Are you all right?
Is there anything we can do for you?
Your trap wasn't half bad...
But I can't use it anymore...
I need a replacement arm.
Sure!
I'll introduce you to an awesome automail mechanic!
I'm Colonel Roy Mustang of the military.
I'm Ling Yao, twelfth prince of the Xing Dynasty.
I'm grateful that you found us a doctor.
You helped us out by helping Maria Ross, as well.
And this thing, too.
Hey, what the hell is that?
He's a homunculus by the name of Gluttony.
Ho-
Apparently, this guy has some sort of connection with a portion of the upper echelons of the military.
"A portion"?!
You have no idea!
King Bradley.
There's a possibility he's a homunculus, as well.
He had a tattoo of Ouroboros on his eye underneath his eyepatch.
He and Gluttony both came after us.
No way...
The top man of the country is a homunculus?!
But...
...Bradley did not give off a sense of not being a human, like Gluttony did.
He feels the same as an ordinary human.
Then...
First of all, if the FÃ¼hrer President is a homunculus, what about his son?!
I read in a book that homunculi are unable to reproduce!
No.
His son, Selim, was adopted.
He doesn't carry the blood of the FÃ¼hrer President.
A monster or a human...
Whichever it may be, now it's easier to drag him out of his position.
We'll get information out of this guy, first.
Let's take his philosopher's stone, too.
I may be able to use it to heal my man.
Hey, hey, hey!
Lan Fan lost her arm to obtain that!
We're taking that back to Xing!
Hang on! We've been searching for a way to get our bodies back for a long time, too!
I won't allow you to take it for yourself!
That's right.
Ling, you're an illegal immigrant.
I can't stand this!
Mustang, I'm going home.
Mustang...
Colonel Mustang... who killed Lust!
Roy Mustang!!!
What...
What is hidden behind the smile of goodwill and kindness?
One must be discreet in order to dig further.
They move forward and run about, not knowing what to do.
Next time, Fullmetal Alchemist:
Episode 24, Inside the Belly.
If you leap in carelessly, all that awaits is a sea of darkness.On the day before the Promised Day,
Alphonse Elric lies dormant in the Eastern training grounds.
However, he is captured by the sudden appearances of the homunculi, Gluttony and Pride.
Alphonse...
Pick yourself up...
Alphonse...
Who...
It's far too early for you to die.
I still have plenty of things for you to do.
Episode 47, Messenger of Darkness.
Excuse me...
Are we in Kanama?
Mr. Hoh!
You've got some visitors.
So you're here, Edwa-
God, that felt good.
The first thing you do is punch me in the face?!
And with your right hand, too!
Looks like you made some new friends.
Fri-
We're just working with him due to the circumstances.
And I'm the boss of all of them.
Oh my.
Thank you for taking care of my son.
Not a problem.
Though he's one hell of a brat.
Shut up!
Interesting tattoo you've got there.
Oh.
This.
Guess there's no point in hiding it.
You'd better not hide anything either, old man.
Tomorrow is the "Promised Day", right?
Yeah.
I'll tell you guys everything.
Guess you won't be able to accept it as easily as Alphonse did.
You told Al too?!
Yeah.
He probably has a lot to think about, but he accepted it.
The philosopher's stone you've been looking for is right here.
Do you want to use it?
Don't fuck with me!
They're lives of people who are totally uninvolved!
We lost our bodies due to our own carelessness!
What gives us the right to use their lives?!
I'm glad my son grew up to say that.
A solar eclipse occurs tomorrow.
He's planning on using that.
A solar eclipse?
How would he use that?
Edward.
Would you be willing to help me stop his plans?
'Help'?!
Don't get the wrong idea!
I'm going to beat the hell out of that geezer even if I 
I'm just listening to what you have to say right now because teaming up with you might increase our odds of winning!
I'm glad to hear...
Whatever the reason may be, you're willing to fight alongside me.
Granny Pinako asked me to tell you Mom's last words.
"Sorry I couldn't keep my promise."
"I'm going to have to leave you first."
Message delivered!
Hey, shouldn't you try to sit knee to knee with your father and open up to him?
Yeah, man.
You should at least call him "Old Man".
Seems like a lot happened in the past,
but he definitely doesn't seem like someone who would abandon his wife.
He probably has a lot of personal reasons.
Come on. Listen to what he has to say.
Shut up already!
I've got a lot of personal reasons, too!
For example?
You're probably just too stubborn and proud.
You can't organize your thoughts very well, right?
Can't really blame you.
He's a philosopher's stone in the shape of a human.
To top it off, he's also your dad.
That's not all of it.
He just showed a side of himself that I wasn't really expecting.
You know... someday, I'll turn into a wrinkled old woman who looks like a monster.
But no matter how I end up looking, I'll always be happy to take a picture with the family where everyone is smiling.
So please... stay with your family.
Trisha, I'm going.
Please wait for me.
Okay.
I'll be waiting.
"Sorry I couldn't keep my promise."
"I'm going to have to leave you first.", huh...
Even though we couldn't age and die together,
you must believe from the bottom of your heart that I'll come after you in the future.
It'll be tomorrow... Trisha.
Here you go.
Thanks.
What are you going to do with that?
You're going to wear something flashy like this again?
Why's it gotta be red?
This is probably going to be our last battle against them.
I'm going to need to be psyched.
Hey, you know...
You don't really have to stick with me through all of this.
I personally think it would be better for you guys if you were to leave to attend to your own business from here.
Hey, you're one of my henchmen. Don't go ordering me around.
I guess you guys want to return to your original bodies too?
I wonder...
This body can be pretty convenient.I guess I wouldn't mind staying like this forever.
That's the spirit!
Then... why?
Well, you know.
We don't really have anywhere else to go.
My animal instincts tell me that I'm better off staying here.
Okay...
And what about you?
Weren't you saying something about running away from the other homunculi?
You're asking why I came back to Central?
Not tellin'.
What is it?
Al!
Man, don't scare me like that!
I'm glad we were able to join up!
How have you been?
Looks like you were safe and sound too, Brother.
Huh? Aren't you supposed to be with Major Miles?
Is everything going well over there?
I actually wanted to talk to you about that.
Could you come here for a second?
Y-Yeah.
Al... is something wrong?
Why do you ask?
I dunno... I just got a feeling.
Ed!
Ling!
Get away from him!
He's...
That's...!
W-What's going on?!
So you joined them, Greed.
And you were taken control of by a human like that...
Your soul is too weak!
The FÃ¼hrer President is still missing?
Apparently, all they found was the corpse of one of his men downstream.
It would be a miracle if he were to be alive after this.
I'll lead the search team, and I'll also ask the Northern Army to lend us a hand.
You're going to step foot on the front lines yourself?
I'll never be able to rest easy until I see his corpse with my own two eyes.
You're not going to target Central as according to your original plan?
Nothing I can do.
I'll just have to hand over the fatty portions of Central to Colonel Mustang.
Currently, the Bradley administration is operating without any trouble.
If Colonel Mustang and Major General Armstrong were to go through with the operation,
they'll probably be treated as rebels.
And when that happens, it'll be my turn to shine.
After they become seen as the villains,
I, Lieutenant General Grumman, the defender of justice, will arrive on the scene.
In order for me to stand at the top of this country with the least amount of risk,
I'm going to need the younglings to pull the chestnuts out of the fire.
That's probably exactly what this raccoon is thinking right now.
I joined forces with him since we're right on the brink of the Promised Day,
but I shouldn't let my guard down until the very end.
A-Al...
It's Pride.
'Pride'?
Yeah.
I guess he's sort of like our eldest brother.
A homunculus?!
So you're going to betray us no matter what, Greed?
Then at this point, you're nothing but an obstacle for us.
Damn you...
How did you know we were here?!
How dare you transform into Al!
I didn't transform into anything.
This is really your little brother's body.
You son of a...!
I'm going to dispose of Greed right here and now.
And then, I'm going to have the Fullmetal Alchemist come with me afterwards.
Hey! You two should hide somewhere-
Wow, you guys sure didn't waste any time, did you?!
Our animal instincts are telling us not to fight that thing!
Are you going to be okay?
Of course I am.
They can't kill Al and I because they need us for whatever reason.
But on the other hand, I can give them everything I've got!
I'm going to beat you to a pulp!
You're right; I'm not going to kill you.
However, I can't guarantee that you won't lose a limb or three.
I can't escape into the slums!
You can't guard against this guy!
That was close!
Well, I've captured your friend.
Do I also have to capture the people in the slums in order for you to cooperate with me?
He's good.
He's going right for your soft spots.
I can't be on the losing side all the time.
What?
A power outage?
What's going on?!
I can't see anything,
but the eyeballs have also disappeared.
Greed!
Is that you, Heinkel?
What's going on?
What happened?!
A shadow only exists if there is light.
He can't even materialize in the dark,
and can't see anything just like us.
So he left?!
He's just lurking somewhere.
If the lights come back on, he'll be back...
What are we going to do, then?!
Heinkel... did you see Alphonse's shadow earlier?
Yeah.
There were a lot of these tentacles crawling about.
Not that.
He was always near a large shadow, right?
Pride's real body is somewhere within the shadows of the forest.
His real body?!
So it's not in Al's armor?!
Nope.
He has a container just for himself to use whenever he goes out.
What kind of 'container'?
No moon or stars in the sky, huh...
They can't maneuver in this darkness either.
Guess I'll just have to wait for the slums to get their power back...
You're not getting away!
So my child's figure doesn't stop you from attacking me.
You're pretty good.
You're right. I do feel bad for having to kill a child!
But then again,
my animal instincts are overwhelming my conscience!
It's telling me that I have to kill you here and now!
Ed!
Hey, Ed!
Is that you, Donkey Kong?
How's your little brother doing?
He doesn't seem to have moved at all.
You can hear it when he does.
Okay. Let's leave this place for now.
You're telling me to abandon Al?!
I understand that you're worried,
but what if we were to approach him carelessly, just to find that it was a trap?
We need to stick together until Heinkel takes care of Pride in order to avoid accidentally attacking each other.
Is that... the sound of Lion King fighting?
Let's just leave it to the nocturnals for now.
Damn that Pride...
How did he know we were here?
That shouldn't be a part of his abilities...
Duck!
Smells like the Fullmetal Alchemist.
Smells like Greed.
Judging from the voice... Gluttony?!
Him?!
Now I get it.
He used Gluttony's keen sense of smell to find us.
I also smell a scent of a guy I don't recognize!
I can eat him, right?
He's talking about you, Darius.
That one's also a homunculus.
How do you expect me to fight against a monster like that?
He's just following his nose.
In this situation, you should be evenly matched.
My animal instincts are telling me not to do it, but...
Men are all about guts!
Victory goes to the swiftest!
One more!
Damn it, Donkey Kong...
I thought we were sticking together to avoid attacking each other...
My bad.
I guess Gluttony will still have the advantage in the dark.
But if we were to turn on the lights, Pride would...
This is troublesome.
Hey, Greed.
That you, Ling?
Switch with me for a sec.
I can sense the aura of the homunculi.
I was also the one to notice Pride, right?
I can fight better than you in this darkness.
Guess I don't have a choice!
You better not run off with this body!
Cut the jokes!
It's my body to begin with!
Rub a dub dub, thanks for the-
There you are!
Nice one!
I'm glad I picked you, man!
I'm honored!
Is it Ling now?!
Yeah!
You're making me angry...!
And I'm also hungry!
But you guys aren't letting me eat you!
That's why...
...I'm just going to swallow you!
I have a bad feeling!
What do you mean?!
Something's coming.

This is... just like back then!
Hey... Whoa, whoa!
What do you guys see that I don't?!
I'm just a normal guy! Explain it to me!
What was that?!
Stay still!
Is there someone else?!
I have no idea.
I haven't got a clue, but this is...!
I...
I know this smell...!
Glad to see you're in top shape!
I've been waiting for you, Lan Fan!
If you only feel fear after knowing both the abilities of your enemy and yourself,
flee with your tail between your legs.
However, if you're going to stand firm and fight with a focused mind,
you will definitely have victory within reach.
Next time, Fullmetal Alchemist:
Episode 48, A Vow Made Underground.
Is it right or wrong to achieve victory by sacrificing a fellow comrade?Edward, huh?
You've grown.
I heard from Pinako...
...that you attempted human transmutation.
After all this time, why did you come back now?!
There's no place for you here anymore!
Oh, right.
Why did you burn down my house?
We decided we wouldn't turn back anymore.
We did it to show our determination-
That's not it.
You just didn't want to see it again.
You wanted to escape your horrifying memories.
You wanted to conceal all traces of the sin you committed.
That's not true!
You're no different from a child who hideshis sheets after wetting himself in his sleep.
You ran, didn't you, Edward?
What do 
Damn it! You're sickening!
He's so similar to the way I was when I was young.
Episode 20, Father in Front of the Grave.
You haven't changed at all.
Not even a bit from the old days.
Why didn't you come back sooner?
Trisha was always waiting for you.
Pinako.
Hm?
The thing my sons transmuted...
Was it really Trisha?
What?
I told you. It didn't even look remotely human.
I can't even call that thing Trisha-
No, that's not what I mean.
For example, the color of her eyes and hair.
What do you mean?
You're telling me that wasn't her?
You're telling me those boys lost their bodies by creating something that wasn't even their mother?
What?! You can continue to function without food or sleep?!
Yup, as long as this seal remains unscathed.
That's amazing! You're literally immortal!
That's not true.
My body is almost like a bomb.
I heard it from Barry.
It's impossible to place a soul that doesn't belong on a body.
If you force a soul on to one, it will eventually be rejected.
Whether that will be tomorrow or ten years later...
...even I don't know.
No way... then you have to find a way to get your body back as soon as possible!
Wait, if your body starts to deteriorate, can't you transfer your soul on to something else and continue to live?
If you do that, you can stay the way you are.
Without feeling pain or needing to eat!
What a convenient body!
Of course it's not convenient!
You don't even know anything!
Sorry.
Winry!
Winry?
I'm coming in.
Geez... You and Brother always get mad before I ever can, so I never get to.
It's because....
It seems this body can't sleep...
Al...
You'll be able to return to your old body, right?
Right?
Give me back my brother's body!
He's... He's the only family I've got!!!
Give it back?
What are you talking about?
You're the one who put your brother in that state.
Alchemist.
That's right.
You and I are the same.
Edward Elric!
And...
Edward... don't leave me like this...
Ed! You still asleep?
Your dad's about to leave.
Can I take this?
It's the only one that has all four of us.
Help yourself.
Thanks.
As a token of my gratitude, I'll tell you something.
Something terrible will happen in this country soon.
Flee to another country.
That's not uncommon here.
And besides, there are kids who call this place home.
Don't say I didn't warn you.
Hohenheim.
Come back every now and then for a meal, won't you?
It's a shame, Pinako,
that I won't be able to eat your cooking anymore.
Are you really going to dig that thing up?
Want to call it off?
No, it's just that my joints are starting to hurt.
Probably because it's about to rain. Let's get this over with.
Ed!
I told you so!
Let's stop this.
No...
If I don't confirm it, I'll never be able to move forward.
Also...
You ran, didn't you?
No way in hell am I going to run!
Granny.
Mom had auburn hair.
This is black.
The femur is way too long.
The pelvis... This is a man.
Granny.
Ed.
This is not your mother.
That's right. You cannot revive the dead.
That's a truth.
It was impossible from the very beginning.
Ed, pull yourself together!
Snap out of it!
I'm fine, Granny...
Since that day, this has been the symbol of despair.
But now, it will lead me to a path with hope.
Al can get his body back.
Hello, you've reached the Curtis'.
Oh, it's you, Ed.
What is it?
Umm... There was something I wanted to ask you...
Well...
What's wrong?
Speak clearly.
It's about the time you tried to revive your baby...
What about it?
Master, the person Al and I transmuted was not our mother.
What do you mean? What are you trying to say?!
The child that was created by your transmutation...
Are you sure it was your child?
I see...
So my son and his wife helped a lot on the battlefield, eh?
Good to know...
He...
Where did Hohenheim say he was headed?
Who knows? He didn't mention a word about it.
Oh, I completely forgot!
I had an important message for him.
Message?
Yeah.
Trisha's will.
Could you pass this on to him when he comes back?
Please tell him I couldn't keep my promise.
That I have to leave him first, and that I'm sorry.
A promise? What promise?
No idea.
Sorry to make you do this, but could you tell him for me if you see him?
Why do 
He may not look it, but he's actually quite worried about you two.
I'll deliver the message after I give him a good punch in the face.
Are you going back to Central?
Yeah, just to get yelled at by Al,
since I went and did a bunch of stuff without telling him.
What the hell is this?!
I'm sorry.
Y-You...
You're in ruins!
And...
What the hell are you guys doing?!
Eating.
Geez, just what happened to you?!
Homunculi and Barry the Chopper?
And on top of it all, a rejection reaction due to different souls and bodies, huh...
Stretching the armor that's left...
Al will be able to return to his old body, right?
Of course.
If I say I'll get his body back, I will.
Al...
I dug up the thing we transmuted back in Resembool.
W-Why did you do something like that?!
As a result, I discovered that what we transmuted wasn't Mom.
What? What does this mean?
But we...
We transmuted something completely different.
No way! Then I...
And now, I'm also confident we can get your body back.
Really?!
Yeah.
But before I get into that...
Y-You remember the time we fought over who'd be m-marrying W-Winry... right?
The thing we talked about up on the roof?
Yeah. So you turned Al down?
Yeah. I did.
And so, I have a question for you two.
Why did you turn him down?
"I don't want to marry a guy who's shorter than me."
Don't decide a man's worth by his height!!!
Huh?
Does this have anything to do with getting Al's body back?
To sum it up, if Al knows something I don't, and Winry remembers the same thing, too...
...it really happened.
Since he remembers something that really happened,it means the soul affixed to that armor is the real Al's.
Even though I could only get your soul,I was able to pull you back from that gate.
If I could pull your soul from the gate, then I should be able to get your body back the same way.
Separated from each other, the body and soul still exist....
Barry the Chopper!
Al, try to remember.
The time you were dragged into the truth.
That time...
That was me! I was there!
That's right. So all I have to do...
...is pull your body out like I did with your soul!
Brother!
I was watching you from that thing's point of view!
So it was you inside that thing?
The soul probably didn't affix due to the rejection reaction.
So we didn't damage anyone's soul...
Sir Elric.
Miss Izumi Curtis is on the line.
I looked into the family lineages of both my husband and me.
As a result, the skin and hair color of that child...
...cannot possibly have come from the two of us.
You were able to find something out, weren't you?
Yes.
Confidence that I'll be able to get Al's body back...
It's impossible to revive the dead.
I see...
It wasn't that I was missing something...
...but rather it was impossible from the very beginning.
Ed.
Yes, ma'am!
Thank you.
What did the master say?
I don't really get it, but she thanked me.
Al?
To be honest, I've been blaming myself nonstop since that day.
That it was me...
...who put Mom in that state and killed her.
Same goes for me, Al.
Thank you, Brother...
I didn't kill Mom!
Izumi.
I feel saved.
I didn't kill our child twice...
But it's true that I put you in that state.
I'm going to get your body back, no matter what-
Brother!
We carry the same sin, since I approved of the plan.
Please don't talk as though it's all your fault.
Trying to do everything by yourself...
I'm tired of other people having to suffer because of me!
Same with Mr. Hughes, too!
When I heard about his death...
I felt from the bottom of my heart I didn't want to return to my body if other people would have to suffer.
Brother...
...even if they don't have the body of humans...
...I've been watching people who live according to the way they are.
Even if I'm in this state, people around me interact with me as though I'm human.
I know my body's like a bomb, but even a body made of flesh could die from accident or disease at any time.
So in order to live a normal life,this body isn't all that inconvenient either.
I've truly started to feel that way.
But...
...I can't stand it any longer.
I'm... I'm...
...tired of spending nights by myself!
That's my reason for wanting to return to my old body.
Yeah, I'll make it happen.
After I beat the shit out of that "truth" guy, I'm going to drag your body out of there!
Yeah!
Huh?
Has he always had such a large back?
The figure of a wounded comrade hurries the man's steps,
and the boy risks everything he has to escape a dead end.
Next time, Fullmetal Alchemist:
Episode 21, The Fool's Progress.
You shall be the one to open fire.Episode 52, Combined Powers.
A philosopher's stone!
Where did he get that?!
Smoke screening again?
Like I'll fall for that again!
A flash bang?!
That one was a decoy!
Nothing less to be expected from the power of a philosopher's stone.
One transmutation after another...!
You...!
The power of a philosopher's stone never ceases to amaze me.
I've used it before, so I know.
And that's why I'm confused about something.
Why don't you use that power to get your body back?
Since you have the stone, it'll be easy to run from us.
Once you get away, you can use the power to get you and your brother's bodies back.
And doesn't that conclude your journey?
If we did that, we wouldn't be able to save everyone.
It's to fulfill your dearest wish.
In order to gain something, one must sacrifice.
Hey,
why are you saying there are only two options?
Getting our bodies back, or saving everyone.
It's strange to think that only one of those can be granted.
Why don't you consider the possibility of getting our bodies back, and at the same time, saving everyone?
What about the law of equivalent exchange?
I think that in order for humanity to progress, we must seek a possibility without being bound by principles.
I see.
If that comes true, it'll be recognized by the world as a new principle.
Right?
Then you should prepare another possibility.
The possibility of the two of you not getting your bodies back, and not being able to save anyone either.
There's more on the way!
Okay! We can at least pierce his skin!
That hurt...
I'm gonna die...
This is such a drag...
Dying is such a drag...
Such a drag...
It's going to be such a drag...
...to have to go all out...
What?!
Major General Armstrong!
Put down your weapons!
What the hell is that giant?!
That was...!
Yeah.
I... missed...
W-What speed...!
Sloth the Lazy.
Sister!
Just barely grazed.
Did you see that?
Only slightly.
Moving at that speed while weighing so much...
It's almost unfair.
Yeah, I'm...
...the fastest homunculus.
Alex!
I think... he's so fast that he can't even control his direction.
Shit-
Finally... I hit.
What a beautiful sound.
The clashing of strong wills produces the most beautiful of sounds.
Alphonse Elric is still nearby.
I'm sure of it.
He won't die that easy.
Right there!
That again? How unexciting.
It's futile.
I told you, I can sense where you are by smell.
Checkmate.
I wouldn't be so sure.
This is where the tenacity of humans comes in!
Even if you have a philosopher's stone,
there's no way you can beat us on your own-
I'm not on my own!
Where did you hide the stone?!
It couldn't be...
The motive behind this cloud of dust is...
...to know the direction of the wind?
He must have something up his sleeve within the leeward where my sense of smell is useless...
Behind me?!
It can't be...!
How can he move with that wound...?!
Doctor Marcoh!
An ice cream truck, right?
Yeah. Don't miss it.
Right.
Alchemy is so useful, isn't it?
It's a simple matter to change the appearance of a motor vehicle.
We can't go in through here either.
All the gates that allow entry into the Central Headquarters have been sealed off.
What should we do?
Force our way through?
No, leave the rough jobs up to the Briggs soldiers.
We'll use an underground route.
Roger.
We're going to split up now.
I want you all to accompany the madam and head to the location.
Roger.
Good thing I'm meaty.
Can't underestimate the power of a philosopher's stone, I guess.
Their legs!
Aim for their legs!
What?!
Alex!
Just a minor dislocated joint.
What about you, Sister?
Just a broken bone or two.
Sister!
I want to hurry up and kill you...
...so I can nap.
He stopped?!
He's hesitant to stab Kimblee?
But why would someone like him...
I see now.
Just as you said, humans are tenacious.
However, you all won't be able to beat us.
As long as...
...our father is seated right over there.
Well, before that, you all need to find a way to get out of this situation.
Who?!
I did it...
I sure did it!
Yoki?!
Nice one, mustache man!
I didn't expect 
I can't let you guys have all the spotlight!
Let me show off too, geez!
Did you see that?!
I, Yoki, gave the strongest homunculus a good beatdown!
You saw it!
Where did you get this car?!
It's the one Kimblee rode here in.
I'm having the drivers take a little break.
Not bad, Doctor Marcoh.
Step on it!
Shut up and drive!
Drive as fast as you can!
I don't plan on fighting that monster head-on again!
Drive to Central!
We need to meet up with Ed and the others and defeat Father before that thing catches up with us!
Brave humans sure are easy to trick.
Oh good, you're still alive.
I like the new color of your suit, Kimblee.
Now I know why they call lions the "king of beasts".
Obeying the rule of "survival of the fittest",
he gouged out your throat.
I guess humans really are of no importance to this world.
You were saying something about wanting to see what option this world would choose, right?
It would be a disgrace if you were to just die here like this.
But don't worry.
You're going to continue to live inside me.
What... happened...?
Alex!
Since he rushes at you on his own, all you have to do is wait for him.
Can you stand, Sister?
Now that I recall, a shoot-on-sight order has been issued for me.
What?!
That won't do!
I'm going to inherit the Armstrong household,
so I can't have you die until you complete the formalities!
You don't need to worry about that.
I've made it so that the mansion will go to Mustang if I were to die.
You made a promise like that without even discussing it with your family?!
He's better than a failure like you by a hair.
Is that how you're supposed to treat someone who came to your rescue?!
What's... going on?
Enemy raid?
Don't tell me... it's Mustang's squad?!
W-What the hell?!
Shooting them doesn't do a thing!
Are they soldiers from Briggs?!
Moron!
Don't confuse my burly men with those scrawny blue monsters!
They're probably the same kind of thing as this is.
The one who commanded you fools is probably behind it.
We were never told of this!
I don't think they care whether or not you were told.
What will you do?
Us siblings can fight those monsters.
But...
So, what will you do?!
Are you going to kill us and end up being eaten by monsters,
or will you cooperate with us to destroy those fiends?!
Learn to think for yourself!
You!
Again?!
It's no use.
They're soldier dolls that were injected with philosopher's stones.
It'll take more than that to kill them!
See? Look at that.
I got stronger by absorbing them because you keep dodging my attacks.
You don't get it at all.
It would be troublesome if those dolls were to all rush at me,
but it's simple as pie to run away if it's only you chasing me!
Bullshit!
These dolls have been injected with philosopher's stones.
That's why they won't die.
So the secret to immortality really is in those stones...?
It's to save my clan!
I need to obtain the secret to immortality!
It hurts...
Pain...
There's 
There's no end to them!
I'm almost out of stings!
I'm just about out of saliva as well.
Dammit!
Shit!
Ed!
It's always so unruly wherever I find you.
Shall I lend you a hand,
Fullmetal?
When people find the truth, they reveal their unconcealed self.
They cannot be stopped.
There is no leisure of making a choice, either.
Next time, Fullmetal Alchemist:
Episode 53, Flames of Revenge.
Reduce everything to ashes.Episode 12, One is All, All is One.
We're almost at Dublith, Brother.
Were you dreaming?
Yeah.
A dream about 
We're finally here, aren't we?
Yup.
I hope the Master isn't home...
Yeah...
H-Hi...
It's been a while...
Welcome.
You've gotten bigger.
I-I'm going to shrink...
Hi... It's me, Alphonse.
It's been a while.
You've 
That's the first time I've been patted on the head since I became like this.
Izumi, the Elric runts are here.
Think you can get up?
I'm fine.
I'm not feeling too bad today.
I guess she was lying down because she wasn't feeling well.
Has her body not healed yet?
You're one idiot of a disciple!
What's this I hear about you becoming a dog of the military?!
Master! W-Well... about this...
Al! Look at how much you've grown!
You haven't changed much either, Mast-
You've slacked on your training!
Oww...
I thought you weren't feeling well?
Forget about that! I'm out of bed like this because I heard you guys were here...
Don't push yourself.
You're worried about me, Dear?
I don't know much about the philosopher's stone.
Because I'm not interested.
I see...
We met an alchemist in Central who knew a lot about the stone, didn't we?
What was he like?
I think his name was...
...Hohenheim.
What's the matter?
So he's alive...
You know him?
He's our father.
So the one who left a long time ago...
That bastard!
It's his fault Mom died.
Because of him...
Oh! What are you doing up so early?
Al said he needed to pee...
Oh, so you were taking care of Al.
Thank you, Ed.
Mom, where's Dad?
He left.
When's he coming back?
Tickle tickle tickle!
Tickle tickle tickle!
He'll be back in no time.
Hurry and finish your meal, now.
Mom...
Mom.
Mom!
Mom!!!
So... did Dad say anything about the stone?
He looked happy, saying something about his wish from long ago will finally be coming true soon.
Ow!
Time to eat!
Okay...
You aren't going to eat, Al?
N-No!
I ate too much on the train...
Hey Al, tell them about how we witnessed childbirth over at Rush Valley!
Oh yeah!
Master, we helped a baby being born!
Idiot, that doesn't count as "helping".
I learned that people are born because everyone in the family works together,
the mother risks her life, and because the person receives so many blessings from everyone.
That's right.
That's how you two were given life, too.
Be proud that you were born.
Brother.
Hm?
Master hasn't changed at all, has she?
Nope.
She hasn't changed at all since we first met her.
Hang in there!
Bring over some more!
It's going to collapse!
The levee's going to break! Run for high ground!
Brother, look!
Hey, it's dangerous!
This should last for a while.
W-Who are you?
A passing housewife!
Will you please be our master, old lady?!
Please, old lady!
I couldn't catch exactly what you said...
Mind repeating it?
C-Correction!
Please be our master, Miss!
No!
Why not?!
I don't take students.
And besides, we're in the middle of a trip!
Please, accept us as your students!
God, you're so persistent!
Do you even have permission from your parents?!
The thing is... those boys don't have any parents.
I'm so soft when it comes to things like this...
Survive on your own!
Huh?
That's the preliminary round.
If you pass, we'll get to the real training.
And you're not allowed to use alchemy during this preliminary round.
What?
"One is All, All is One."
Find the answer to that within a month.
If you can't, I'm sending you back to Resembool.
Later!
Huh?!
What the heck?!
So hungry...
I want to sleep in a bed, geez...
What part of this is alchemy training?!
So hungry...
I wonder if those kids are all right?
They say there's no substitute for real-life experience.
That is the best way to pound the courage portion of alchemy into them.
If they don't learn anything from this,it just means that's the extent of their talents.
They'll have to give up learning from me.
What I'm worried about is the safety of their lives.
I was thrown out to Mt. Briggs in the middle of winter for a month during 
Don't put yourself and ordinary people at the same level.
There's so much to eat on that island; they'll live.
We did it!
How do we eat this?
Hmm... We cut it apart.
Cut it apart...
I don't want to do it!
You do it!
I did the catching; you do the killing.
You always try to make me do all the things you don't want to do!
Get back here!!!
Baby foxes...
Forget meat... let's try for some fish.
How do we catch one?!
We don't have a rod, line, or a needle!
No food, no fire, no nothing...
Don't say that!
Geez!
What was that for, Brother?!
Brother?
Sour!
I'm... alive.
Eating ants and living.
Eating life and living.
Living...
We're not going to die here!
Right!
Sorry about this...
You're almost there, Brother.
We did it!
Looks like tomorrow's the end of the month...
Hey Brother,
did you ever find the answer to "One is All, All is One"?
I've been thinking about it for the longest time, but I only kind of understand it.
I'm not positive, but...
Remember when I ate ants when we were starving and out of it?
You did?
Yep, I did.
They were so sour.
Then, a thought came to my mind.
If I hadn't eaten them and eventually died,
foxes and ants would eat me.
I'd return to the soil and become grass.
And that's what a rabbit would eat.
The food chain, right?
Yeah.
But that's not all.
Even this island could have been underwater in the ancient times.
And tens of thousands of years in the future,it could be a summit of a mountain.
Everything is connected?
Everything is within a large stream that can't be seen.
I don't know if that stream should be called the universe or the world,
but from the point of view of something that big, you and I are like ants.
A small individual within a stream.
We're just "one" within the "all".
But only when those "ones" gather together, can an "all" exist.
It's the promised day.
Let's hear your answer to "One is All, All is One".
"All" is the world!
And "One" is me!
Good! We can start the real training now.
All right!
A basis of a transmutation circle is the power of the circle.
The circle displays the circulation of power,
and by sketching the construction symbol in it,it becomes possible to activate its power.
This is also a circulation of power.
It's best to experience it for yourself.

Now...
Review it until lunch is ready!
Okay, so...
The circle displays the circulation of power,
and by sketching the construction symbol in it,it becomes possible to activate its power.
But you were transmuting by just slapping your palms together, weren't you, Master?
Do you not need to sketch the construction symbols?
I am like a construction symbol.
What do you have to do in order to do that?
You might be able to do it if you ever reach the truth.
Master has also seen the truth...
And? What did you want to talk to me about?
W-Well...
As I thought, you can transmute without a construction symbol!
Additionally, Alphonse is an empty suit of armor!
You've got automails for an arm and leg!
How did you know, Master?!
I can tell from just sparring with you!
You... saw it, didn't you?
Am I right?!
Y-Yes, ma'am!
Both master and pupil, making the same stupid decisions.
Master, you...
Because you saw that thing...
We had a hard time conceiving a child.
Just when we thought we were having a baby, I fell ill.
Because of that, our child wasn't born into this world alive.
So...
...I committed taboo.
Thanks to that, all sorts of organs were taken from me.
I'm such an idiot.
I should have told you sooner.
It must have been tough.
N-No!
It's something we did to ourselves.
We don't particularly find it tough...
I think about what to eat when I get my body back.
It's quite the opposite; it's more of an anticipation!
Right, Brother?
Yeah!
That's exactly it!
You morons...
No need to force yourselves.
Forgive us...
We're sorry...
Forgive us...
We're sorry...
Forgive us...
We're sorry...
Forgive us...
This world is flowing while abiding by a great rule that's unimaginable.
Learning about that flow,breaking it down, and rebuilding it.
That's what alchemy's all about.
And it's also what living is about, too.
The basics of alchemy, breakingsomething down and rebuilding it...
That's almost like the food chain.
If you eat a rabbit, you break downits meat and rebuild it into your own body.
And even that rabbit rebuildsthe grass it ate into its own body.
Alchemy is life itself.
A man who enjoys his own desires.
His name is Greed.
Whether he be friend or foe, the figure that stands before Ed and Al is a body made for fighting.
Next time, Fullmetal Alchemist:
Episode 13, The Beasts of Dublith.
A powerful figure appears before the two.The First Branch of the National Central Library, where Marcoh's research data was kept, was burned down.
Ed and Al obtain the research data with the help of Sheska, a former librarian. However...
The ingredients of philosopher's stones...
...are live humans.
Seeking more of the truth, Ed and Al sneak into the abandoned Research Laboratory 5.
Episode 8, Research Laboratory 5.
You're pretty fast for a guy so big.
Else it wouldn't be fun for me!
Who are you?!
I'm Number 66.
That's just my work name, though.
I'll dismantle you neatly,
so go ahead and wail!
What the heck is this?
Could it be what's used to transmute philosopher's stones?
Precisely.
I don't know who you are, but I'm amazed you figuredthat out by just looking at the transmutation circle, boy.
Who are you, old man?
My duty is to guard this area.
I suppose I'll introduce myself as Number 48.
And I'm not an old man, either.
I've been instructed to eliminate any outsiders who have infiltrated the building.
Don't think badly of me, boy.
Same goes for you...
Don't take it too badly when you get beaten by a boy.
An alchemist, huh?
Let's see how good you are.
Looks like that arm saved your life!
But my beloved sword even slices through steel!
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Do you not have a body in there?
I'm amazed you noticed.
I spar with someone like you all the time.
Ah, so there's someone in this state in the outside world, too, eh?
I don't like this at all.
That there's some idiot other than me who'd come up with the idea of affixing a soul to a suit of armor.
Let me introduce myself again.
48 was my death row number.
When I still had my body, I was called Slicer the Homicide.
Death row. Just as I thought.
Hey, this place makes philosopher's stones out of criminals on death row, right?
That I cannot answer.
I was simply hired for my skills, given this body,and stationed here as a watchdog.
Which means there's a seal somewhere that mediates the soul and the armor.
Precisely.
This seal of blood...
If you destroy it, you win.
You're awfully kind to let me in on your weakness.
I'm the type that seeks thrills in fighting.
Since you're so kind, want to let me off the hook?
Was that worth a try?
Do you really think a murderer is just going to let his prey get away?
Here I come!
Like~I~said~
Elicia's having her third birthday!
Lt. Colonel Hughes, I'm working right now.

What a coincidence! So am I.
But seriously, she's so cute.
I get it! Quit calling me about your daughter all the time.
And with an army line, too!
Not just my daughter.
I'm proud of my wife, too!
All right, all right, I'll listen to your story, too.
About your cute and charming "Scar" you're so proud of.
We've found several unidentified bodies.
They're pretty decomposed, so it'sdifficult to determine if he's in there.
There haven't been any sightings of him in the East,so as of now, most people believe he's dead.
If that's the case, we can probably setthe Elric brothers free of their escorts soon.
Is Major Armstrong still in charge of that?
Nah, apparently the Major's subordinates have taken over.
They got us!
I knew they were being too quiet...
Major Armstrong's going to kill us for dereliction of duty!
Those brats! They should put themselves in their escorts' shoes every once in a while!
Let's go!
Huh? Where?
Where do you think?
The former Research Laboratory 5!
Huh? Something doesn't feel right in my shoulder...
...this time so it would be more resistant to rust,but that makes it less durable, so don't overuse...
If I don't settle this quick...
...I'm in trouble!
You're almost like a monkey.
What'd you say?!
I haven't had worthy prey like you in a while. I'm delighted.
But with your wounds and fatigue, the outcome is clear.
My companion should have disposed of your companion by now.
Is your companion strong?
He is. Weaker than me, though.
No worries there, then.
I've been in a lot of fights with himsince we were little, and I've never won.
Dammit, stay still and let me cut you, hippo!
That body...
I've got a few circumstances of my own.
Actually, let me tell you a story.
You've heard of him, too, haven't you?
A middle-aged man by the name of Barry.
A long, long time ago, there was a middle-aged man here in Central named Barry who loved to cook.
Barry loved to cut up meat.
But one day, it got to the point he couldn't satisfy himself with just beef and pork,
so he started to go out into the city during nighttime to cut up humans.
Barry was eventually caught, but the number of people who fell victim to him was twenty-three.
After terrorizing the hell out of the residents of Central, he was sentenced to death by hanging.
And everyone lived happily ever after...
...is the story given to the public.
But there's actually a sequel to the story.
Barry isn't actually dead.
He's alive and has been assigned to watch over a certain somewhere.
Though he's had his body taken away.
That's right! The man standing in front of you right now is the infamous serial killer, Barry the Chopper!
Sorry, I've never heard of you.
I was born in the countryside in the East, so...
Yeah, but even if you've never heard the story, shouldn't you give some kind of reaction?!
Something like...
"AHHHH!", or "What's with that body?!"
AHHHH! W-W-W-What's with that body?!
That hurt, you know.
Oh, so you were sentenced to death, too.
Scaring me like that...
I'm not a criminal!
Huh? Then why?
Well... I've had a few circumstances of my own.
My older brother affixed my soul when I lost my body.
Brother?
I see. Your brother, eh?
What's so funny?
Are you guys really brothers?
I mean, our personalities are different, but...
Oh. No, no, no, that's not what I meant.
What I meant to say was, maybe you'rean armor doll your "brother" created?
Huh?
Does your real human self really exist?
Of course it does!
I'm Alphonse Elric, a human! No doubt about it!
How can you be so sure?
Because I have memories from when I was born!
What if those were created, too?
But Winry and Granny...
They're probably in on it, too.
Yeah, that's how it is.
You didn't exist to begin with.
T-Then... what about you?
It's simple.
Don't move! This place is restric-
See?
I love hacking live humans!
I love to kill, and I can't get enough of it!
I exist to kill.
That's the only proof I need to know that I am who I am!
So your little brother is that strong, eh?
Then I had better defeat you quickly.
Al, now!
What?!
How foul!
Like there are rules in a fight!
What's wrong? My blood seal isn't broken yet.
Just hurry up and dest-
There's something I want to ask you.
About the philosopher's stone?
Spill everything you know.
No can do.
Hey now, the loser shouldn't be putting on a brave front.
I... haven't lost yet.
Impossible!
I forgot to mention it. Slicer the Homicide...
...Was actually a duo of brothers.
The head and body are two different people?!
That's cheating.
And who's the one who said there aren't any rules in a fight?
Let's go for Round 2, runt.
Don't call me a runt!
Whoa, I'm not going to give you time for a transmutation!
Shit, I lost too much blood.
I'm starting to feel dizzy...
This is bad...
Bad...
I'm...
I'm going to die!
This is it for you!
Ouch...
Making me remember that jerk.
I just did the same thing he did.
You've gone and done it now, brat!
Man, that's disgusting!
Brother!
It's shameful, but we lost.
You're not going to say something like, "Hey, we're actually a trio", are ya?
We won't, we won't.
Just destroy us already, boy.
Spare me from having to murder someone.
You consider us human?
If I didn't accept you two as human,it would mean I'm doing the same to my brother, too.
Hey now, what's wrong, armor doll?!
I'm not an armor doll!
That's what you think.
Did you really exist to begin with?
Are you sure about that?
There's a way to prove you're not an armor doll.
You've got a blood seal, too, don't you?
Erase it yourself.
If you die, you were human!
If you're still movin', then you're an armor doll!
I-I can't do something like that!
Then I'll do it for you!
My little brother is human.
So are you two.
That's why I don't want to kill you.
Brother?
Us two have been stealing, destroying,and murdering ever since we came of age.
And we're being treated as humans for the first time, after being turned into this?
Interesting.
I'll tell you everything as a parting gift, boy.
The one who created the philosopher's stone and told us to guard this place is...
That was close.
You can't be talking about things like that, 48.
Huh? What's the Fullmetal runt doing here?
What a troublesome child.
How did you find out about this place?
Brother! Brother?!
BROTHER!!!
You're so annoying, dumbass!
You guys were about to kill a precious sacrifice!
Don't you understand?!
What were you gonna do if you screwed up the plan?!
Huh?!
Who the hell are you two?!
What plan?!
What do you mean by sacrifice?!
Oh? This runt is ready to go.
Quit calling me a runt!
A runt's a runt, don't you agree?
I don't like fighting.
It hurts if you get injured.
You're the one that started it!
I'll beat you to a...












Looks like it's broken.
WHAT?!
Lucky me!
Good thing your arm broke.
You didn't have to suffer any other injuries.
Listen, boy.
Don't forget you're being kept alive.
It'll be troublesome if a boy like thishappens to find this place again.
Let's burn it down.
Hey... there's something I've always wanted to ask you...
...but I've been too scared to.
What was Brother trying to say?
"Something he was too scared to say?"
Something he was too scared to...
...maybe you're an armor doll your "brother" created?
Does your real human self really exist?
What's wrong, armor dollie?
Shut up!! I'm...
Just accept it. It'll make you feel better.
You're full of openings, hippo!
Huh?!
Don't move!
Just surrender.
This isn't good...
Sergeant... evacuate!
What are you doing?!
Hurry and get out of here!
But Brother's still inside!
What did you say?!
Well, this leaves me no choice.
I guess I'll just get out of here!
Hey!
You guys better run, too!
Wait!
Brother! Brother!
Get out of here!
You'll get caught in it, too!
But!
Howdy.
A package for you.
Brother?!
He isn't in danger or anything, but he lost a lot of blood, so get him to a hospital quick, okay?
Oh yeah, and make sure you guys keep an eye on him so he doesn't do anything too reckless.
He's an important guy, after all.
And who are you?
Second Lt. Ross, hurry!
Sergeant, lend me a hand!
He's covered in blood!
We'll talk later! You'd better get out of here, too-
Huh? He's gone.
Let us out!
You plannin' on lettin' us die?!
Shut up! Pipe down!
What a nice sound.
This is the sound of a building crumbling due to explosives.
Judging from the proximity... it's probably Research Laboratory 5 next door.
Ah, what a nice sound...
It shakes me to my bones.
Shut your trap, Kimblee!
Ah, I apologize.
It reminded me of the Ishbal Extermination, and it just made me so happy...
...maybe you're an armor doll your "brother" created?
And so, about Central...
The bigwigs who oversee State Alchemists are going through a labor shortage thanks to Scar.
Oh?
Rumor is it won't be long beforeColonel Mustang is invited to Central.
Central, huh?
Not bad.
You'd better watch out.
If you manage to get to the top at that age,you'll gain a lot of enemies.
I'm prepared for it.
Words of wisdom from your senior in Central.
Have a lot of people who understand and are willing to support you.
So...
Hurry up and get married.
None of your business!
Why'd he hang up on me like that?
Lt. Colonel Hughes, please keep personal calls to a minimum!
Oh, sorry.
Edward Elric hesitates to speak his words...
...and Alphonse Elric becomes perplexed by Barry's words.
The one certainty is that a girl's memories hold the truth.
Next time, Fullmetal Alchemist:
Episode 9, Artificial Feelings.
Their hearts waver because they put their trust in each other.The Ice Alchemist?
Yes. He has infiltrated Central.

Yes, sir.
I'm thankful you were in Central at this time.
I can leave this to you without reservation.
Oh, and that boy is here as well.
Utilize him to your liking.
FÃ¼hrer President Bradley, by "boy", do you mean...
Yes. The Fullmetal Alchemist, Edward Elric.
Geez, that Colonel is a slave driver.
And we'd just bought a train ticket to Liore, too. Guess we're going to have to cancel that.
Well, nothing we can do.
Let's get this over with quick, Al.
All right, Brother.
There he is! That way!
Stop! If you don't...
Freezing and boiling. The elements of water.
Alchemy...
That's pretty horrible.
Sacrifices are inherent when attempting something great.
It's called equivalent exchange.
This and that 
Without a transmutation circle?!
You've got no time to be gawking!
What?!
There's no way!
It should have boiled if there was a drop of liquid in it!
You ruined my coat.
Automail...
Genius alchemy skills that don't require transmutation circles...
...and an automail as his right arm.
So you're...
...that Fullmetal Alchemist, Edward Elric!
Episode 1, The Fullmetal Alchemist.
Wait... that's not you?
Umm... well...
I'm Alphonse, his younger brother.
So this runt is...
Who are you calling short?!
To think that someone with the title of "Fullmetal Alchemist"...
...would be such a small child...
Quit calling me short!!!
Brother, I don't think he was talking about your height.
Even so, I can't forgive him!
As expected from Edward Elric, the Fullmetal Alchemist.
We appreciate your support.
Oh no, I'm his little brother, Alphonse Elric.
Sorry to make you wait, Al.
Let's go.
Geez, you're in such a rush...
Steam...
Brother, he's...
Damn him, using petty tricks!
Looks like you underestimated your opponent, Fullmetal.
Who the hell is he?
That's why I told you to listen up earlier.
But you claimed that you would be able to-
Yeah, yeah, I get it. My mistake.
You should always listen to your seniors.
Yeah, yeah.
In any case...
His name is Isaac McDougal.
He used to be a State Alchemist and was called Isaac of the Ice.
Used to?
That's right.
He performed outstandingly duringthe Ishbal War as a member of our army.
He gave up his title of State Alchemist after the war and became involved in a dissident movement.
Capturing him is a top priority.
But if circumstances dictate it, we may have to kill him.
I'm not going to kill.
Do as you wish.
All we really want are results.
By the way,
have you found any clues on how to fix your body?
Like you'd give us time for that!
Yo, Roy.
What a rough order, capturing the Ice Alchemist, eh?
Or could this be a chance for a promotion?
Whoa! Are you two perhaps... the Elric Brothers?

Oh man, I'm quite honored to be able to meet the youngest State Alchemist.
I'm Maes Hughes, a Lieutenant Colonel.
U-Umm... I'm Alphonse Elric, the younger brother.
What?! 
You'd better not call me a shrimp...

Hughes.
Yo.
If you don't have anything to do here, go home already.
I will, after I do what I need to.
You guys probably haven't booked a place to stay yet, right?
If so, stay at my place.
It's my wife, Gracia, and my daughter, Elicia.
Elicia-chan~
Ow, Daddy! Your beard hurts!
Oh really?
Rub-rub-rub.
Nooo!
Say hi to our guests, the Elric Brothers.
So tall!
So short!
Elicia-chan, I'm Edward Elric.
This is my 
Understand? 
If you're the older one, how come you're so short?
Now, now, they're letting us stay. Calm down.
Lemme go! Lemme go, Al!
Let's start dinner. Gracia is a great cook.
Whoa!
Come on, eat up.
Itadakimasu!
It's so good! Wow, it tastes great!
Eat a lot, okay?
Okay!
Oh, Alphonse, you can't eat with that armor on, can you?
O-Oh, this is...
Al is... in the middle of an alchemy training right now!
All right, Al. I'll eat for the both of us like always, okay?
Leave it to me, leave it to me!
Training~ Training~

That's the funniest joke I've heard in a while.
Join forces with the Ice Alchemist?
Me, the Crimson Alchemist?
Kimblee, let's defeat Bradleyand the corrupt military, together.
I know you've seen it at Ishbal, too. That hell.
You know what Bradley made us do.
That's why you killed those officers, is it not?
Oh no, please don't misunderstand me.
I wasn't thinking of anything lofty like you are.
The reason I killed them...
...is because I wanted to. That's it.
It's a shame, Kimblee.
It really is.
Thanks.
This is rare. You can't sleep?
Yeah.
Should I take a guess?
You were thinking about those two, weren't you?
State Alchemists are calledthe "dogs of the military" by the public.
When I think that he has to carry such a burden at such an age...
Brother, are you awake?
Gracia-san's quiche was just like Mom's, don't you think?
Yeah, it tasted great.
Really?
Then I'd better add that to my"List of things to eat when I get my body back".
Yeah, you'd better do that!
Brother?
Hmm?
It would be nice to get our bodies back to normal soon, wouldn't it?
Yeah.
Just one more...
With just one more, Bradley will fall straight to hell.
According to reports, Isaac infiltrated Central Prison last night.
We cannot let the situation continue any longer. Make sure you seek him out.
Block the roads and search everywhere.
You are authorized to shoot him on sight for all I care.
This is an order from the FÃ¼hrer President!
I... will be heading out, as well!
Hurry, relief soldiers!
Five casualties so far. Report to headquarters!
This is horrible...
It was a steam explosion...
If the temperature of water is raised rapidly, it expands explosively.
A human body is 70% water, after all.
Let's hurry. We have to find that guy fast.
Yeah.
There.
To dodge my alchemy... As expected of you, Sir Isaac.
That voice... Armstrong!
Precisely!
The Strong Arm Alchemist,
Alex Louis Armstrong!
Take this!
High-pressure water slashes through a variety of things!
It's quite meaningless against my fist, though!
Major!
Watch out!
Water from a canteen, eh?
Thanks, Al.
We've got to go after him, Brother.
Let's go, Elric Brothers!
Yes!
Right!
It's been a while, Ice.
Roy Mustang...
...no, the Flame Alchemist.
It's a shame that I must fight a past comrade.
Comrade? I do not have any friends.
The only ones that were at Ishbal were the corrupted army and their dogs!
It's just fire, after all.
It can't win against water!
Dammit!
Good, good...
That's it for you!
I was wondering what the heck you were doing in an alley like this back then...
...so I came back, and bingo.
No use trying to run away.
Run? There's no need for that.
A simultaneous alchemy reaction... like this?
No way...
Don't tell me... could this be...
The philosopher's stone!
What?!
It's freezing all of the moisture in the atmosphere...
Edward Elric.
Dog of the military. State Alchemist!
Do you have any idea what this country is trying to do?!
Hell if I know! More importantly...
If you 
I told you, I don't know!
All right, Al, good work!
Brother, his alchemy...
Yeah!
Hey, you!
You have the philosopher's stone, don't you?!
What are you talking about?
If you're not going to tell me, then I'll 
Is this really the time to be blabbering nonsense?!
A skill that has been passed downthe Armstrong household for generations...
We're leaving it to you, Major!
Artistic Alchemy!
Engrave it on your soul!!
What?!
What the hell are you doing, Major?!
No, I...
The wall of ice...
...is connecting....
Could it be... that man...
...is trying to freeze Central...
...no, Central Headquarters?!
Major! Al and I will stop that guy.
While we're on that, please take care of the transmutation circles!
I need to destroy them, right? Got it!
King Bradley! Now is finally the time for me to to send you to hell with my ice!
Now wait just a second!
Out of the way!
Hot! Hot! Hot! Hot!
Brother!
Too slow!
Al!
An... empty armor?!
You... established a soul onto a piece of armor?!
Losing an arm...
...and the little brother is left without a body...
I get it now. You guys...
...committed taboo, didn't you!
The greatest taboo an alchemist can commit...
Human transmutation!!!
Al!!! Alphonse!!!
Shit! This isn't how it was supposed to be!
Dammit!!! They took it away!!!
Give him back... He's my little brother...
Give him back... He's my only brother!!
You... just took a step toward hell.
Just give up!
There's no water for you to use.
You've forgotten...
...what 70% of the human body is made of!
Brother!
You guys don't know the true face of this country!
Brother... Brother!
Al, we're going after him.
Using little tricks like these...
Did we do it?
Again?!
Don't you dare underestimate my flames!
Seriously...
Keep your useless days to rainy days only, please.
Bradley!
Brace yourself!
Too bad for you.
Major! Now!
Roger that!
FÃ¼hrer President King Bradley...
Ah, good work, Fullmetal Alchemist.
I now have something to brag to my son about, that I was able to lend you a helping hand.
What, you've caught a cold?
Anyway, I heard you were great out there!
All I did was destroy the transmutation circles.
The FÃ¼hrer President defeated him.
And the FÃ¼hrer President is saying that it was your work.
What, are you unsatisfied?
Accept his words thankfully.
You've always said this, haven't you?
"You should always listen to your seniors."
In the end, we never found out whether he had a philosopher's stone or not.
Yeah, we're going to have to wait for the investigation by the army.
Edward Elric, I heard you were hospitalized, and...
...I came here right away!
Now, how about I comfort you while you're bored out of your mind from being hospitalized!
Don't they just bring warmth to your heart? These graceful muscles of mine.
Don't be shy, now. You can touch them.
Stop it!!!
I see. So Isaac died.
He was a human sacrifice candidate, too. That's too bad.
And? What about the philosopher's stone?
Oh, so he used it all up.
Gluttony, you're not supposed to be eating weird things.
Yeah, it's all going well in Liore.
It will begin soon.
Very soon.
Resembool.
The kind town where the boys were born and spent their childhood with their mother.
Seeking for that smile that was lost,
the boys commit taboo and witness the "Truth".
Next time, Fullmetal Alchemist:
Episode 2, The Day It Began.
It was his heart that decided to step out into the world.Who in the world are those guys?
They're Kimblee's men, dispatched from the Central Army. Supposedly "bodyguards" for the Rockbell girl.
What the hell are you planning to do at Briggs, Kimblee?
Episode 37, The First Homunculus.
You should have told me if you were coming north.
I didn't have time. I was in a rush.
You guys are 
Why were you locked up, anyway?
It was just a misunderstanding.
They'll be set free soon enough.
I'll go through the formalities later.
Thank you, Mr. Kimblee.
Please look after these blockheads for me.
Of course.
Hey. Don't trust Kimblee too much.
Why? He's a nice man.
Ms. Rockbell.
Your parents were the doctors who lost their lives at Ishbal, were they not?
Yes.
As I thought.
It was my unit who recovered their bodies.
We were a second too late.When we arrived at the scene, they were already...
I see...
They obeyed the ethics of medicine andstuck to their convictions until the very end.
I admire them from the bottom of my heart.
I wish I could have met them while they were still with us.
They kept a picture that was taken with an adorable little girl.
Your existence must have been what drove them onwards.
It's a pleasure to make your acquaintance, Miss Winry Rockbell.
Hey! Do you know what he did at Ishbal?!
I've only heard the true stories about Ishbal from the Lieutenant.
From the Lieutenant...
You're in love with Winry, aren't you?
Calm down!
Just... Just think about something else, Ed!
Hydrogen, helium, lithium, beryllium...
...carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, sulfur...
E-Ed?

...cobalt, nickel...
Why did I fall for a weirdo like him?
Did you say something?
N-Nothing!
Oww!
D-Damn you, I told you to let me know before you join the nerves!
Yeah, whatever. Now for your leg.
It's so light!
Doesn't its durability suffer if you make it so light?
If you look at the big picture, it's less durable than it used to be, but the key points have been reinforced.
Why are you out of your cell?
Dunno.
I guess you can think of it asmy capability as a State Alchemist.
You finally switched to a northern type?
Looks like you've got some changes, too.
This suits me the best!
Light-weight combat automail, M-1910!
What?! The tip of your nails are reinforced!
Don't tell me it's made out of diamond?!
That's right. It's a Neo M-1910, Mad Bear G!
Hey! Want me to equip you with something like this, Ed?!
No thanks!
So who is this pretty gal?
She's my mechanic.

What the hell was that for?!
It kind of pissed me off.
What an ass...
That's the first time I've actually seen a northern automail!
I'm so happy!
Really?
Then do you want to look around my workplace?
Yes! Yes, I'd love to!
Hey!
What?
W-Well...
Don't get too carried away and walk around all over the place.
It's kind of dangerous around here. In a lot of ways.
Gotcha. I won't. Thanks for the warning.
Thanks for allowing me to look around!
This one right here is pretty rare.
Wow! This is amazing! Isn't this a Crocodile?!

Yeah, that's right.
The thing really setting this apart from others is...

Well, since your limbs are good to go...
...let's get down to business...
...Mr. Fullmetal Alchemist.
So...
...why can't 
Mr. Kimblee's orders.
We've been told to only release the Fullmetal Alchemist for now.
Kimblee's men...
They thought this through, not letting us work together.
They've also taken the effort to bring Winry here to show us that she's in their hands.
I guess that shows how cautious they are about us.
I can't rush this. I have to wait for the right chance.
The advance unit only brought enough food for three days.
It's already been a week since they left.
They could be on the verge of starvation.
I'm also worried about their sanity.
Being in complete darkness for an entire week is...
Let us put our trust in their minds.
General, there's no knowing what could happen down there.
If we don't return in twenty-four hours, please seal this entrance.
Understood.
Since you're all here, I have something to tell you.
The murder of Lieutenant General Raven was my decision and act, alone.
You all didn't see or hear anything.
If word gets out, blame everything on me.
Aye, ma'am.
Let's get moving.
I see. Looks like things are starting to get hectic up north.
Yeah. We're going to have to start taking the initiative from now on.
Briggs is staffed with men well-versed in defense.
Only one who excels in both offense and defense can snatch a victory by making the first move.

It's an honor to be selected as a partner for her tag team.
I think you have it wrong.
She said she just wants the power of the Eastern Army, and she'd rather you take a hike.
Oh, okay...
Let me ask you this, though. What if I sold this information to the FÃ¼hrer President for my own gain?
"Impossible. Mustang wouldn't do that," so she says.
That'll be 35,000 cenz.
It's an honor.
Madam, who are you exactly?
Just a florist who's worked with the Armstrongs for generations.
Hughes, it seems the people who truly understand and support you are the ones who fought beside you in a war.
Now...
What to do with these flowers...
What in the world?
What a weirdo.
Oh, god! He's looking this way!
This is horrible...
It's the same as Smith's arm.
Even metal has been cut up.
Stay on your toes. The enemy may still be around.
There's someone there!
Don't worry.
Look, it's me.
L-Lieutenant Henshel?
Thank god you're alive.
Is it just the two of you?
What about the others?
E-Everyone else is in... p-pieces!
We... We have to get out of here quickly!
That thing will come back!
"That thing"?
D-Don't turn on the lights!
The shadow... The shadow will come back!
Calm down!
Hey!
Hey! Get a hold of yourself!
The shadow!
Can you stand?
Let's go.
Carry as many men as you can.
I apologize for visiting so late at night.
I've come to deliver an urgent document to the FÃ¼hrer President.
Oh, my. I'm sorry.
He's not at home right now.
I'd like him to look through these by tomorrow.
By tomorrow, right? I'll let him know.
Thank you very mu-
You were still awake, Selim?
Yes. I heard the door open,so I thought Father might have returned.
This is Lieutenant Hawkeye.
Good evening, Miss Hawkeye.
It's a pleasure to meet you.
Do you always work such late hours?
That's right. I've come to deliver a document to your father.
I apologize for waking you.
Now, Selim. You must sleep now, or you'll have a difficult time waking up tomorrow.
Okay.
He seems like a bright boy.
Yes, we're very proud of him.
You could call me an indulgent mother if he were my real child, but since he's an orphan, I can boast all I want.
Well, he's distantly related to my husband, so it could be his blood that made him so wonderful.
He's not related to you?
No.
According to the Colonel, King Bradley was raised as a test subject since he was an infant and has no blood relatives.
He shouldn't have any distant relatives.
And that feeling I sensed earlier...
Just who is that boy?
Oops, did you notice?
Oh, that mother of mine...
She just loves to talk.
I sensed a hint of bloodlust earlier.
I've felt the same sensation before...
And I just remembered where it was from.
It's the same sensation I felt when a homunculus by the name of Gluttony snuck up on me.
Selim Bradley...
Just what are you?
You have quite the nerve to ask me that in this situation, Lieutenant Hawkeye.
It's also smart of you not to pull out your gun, which you're so skilled with.
You can't defeat me.
Are you also a homunculus, like Gluttony?
No, I sense a power that can hardly be compared to that of Gluttony's.
I'd be offended if you put me on the same level as him.
My name is Pride. The first homunculus.
The first homunculus, you say?
What do you mean by that?
Exactly as the words mean.
So you're planning on gathering as much information as you can, huh?
You're really a brave one.
What do you say you join us?
Join you?
You just want another pawn, don't you?
I see. That's a shame.
In that case...
Will you cut the empty threats already?
There's no benefit in killing a hostage, is there?
I'm amazed you saw through it.
However, Lieutenant Hawkeye...
I'll always be watching you from your shadows.
Work?
Yes, as a State Alchemist.
You have three tasks from the FÃ¼hrer President.
Your first task is to search for Scar. All you have to do is find him.
I'll take care of him after that.
Your second task is to look for Doctor Marcoh, who is presumed to be escaping alongside Scar.
Doctor Marcoh is with Scar?
Just like with your previous task,after you find him, I'll take care of the rest.
Then, your third task is to carve a bloody crest into Briggs.
Carve a bloody crest?
It's the same as Ishbal.
Slaughtering humans and carving a symbol of hatred and sorrow into the land.
There's no way I could...
You became a dog of the military without the resolve to kill?
With the resolve 
With a resolve not to kill...
That can also be true, if you stick with it.
Are you lending them a hand,knowing what those guys are up to?
They're-
I want to see how the world will change.
Resolve pitted against resolve.
Will clashing against will.
Life against life.
And humans against the homunculi.
Who will win? Which will the world choose as the victor?
If humans are defeated by homunculi, those who claim to be an evolved form of them, it's truly a historical moment.
I just want to live to see that happen.
Why are you, a human, working with the homunculi?
Because they'll let me use my alchemy as I please.
You're insane.
I know that I'm not normal.
But if someone like me survives this,then it means the world's selected me.
The survivors...
It's a battle for existence.
How worthwhile.
I can't understand you.
Oh, what a shame.
I always thought all alchemists were selfish.
Let me try appealing to your selfish side.
Here's something you want more than anything in the world.
If you accept the job, it's yours.
A philosopher's stone!
Let me talk it over with Al and Winry.
With Miss Winry, too?
I haven't told her anything.
Whatever job I may have to do,I don't want to lie to her and betray her.
Very well.
I'll be monitoring you, so you don't tell her anything she doesn't need to know.
Winry.
You're currently being kept as a hostage.
What? What do you mean?
Is this a joke?
Listen up.
I've been instructed by the higher-ups to do my duty as a human weapon.
So I may have to be party to mass murder.
What?!
But can't you just refuse...
Oh, so that's why I'm...
No... I'm being a burden to you two.
I won't cry!
I'm sorry.
I'm just mad at myself for being so happy-go-lucky.
Why is this...
You two just want to get your bodies back...
About that...
They'll give us a philosopher's stone if I help them.
What? A stone?
But...
Kimblee has one.
Yeah, but those stones are made of...
I know that!
Do whatever you want, geez...
That's the plan.
I've decided to take the job.
Let me look for Scar first.
Oh? Why is that?
Scar killed Winry's parents.
I want to avenge them.
I see. Fair enough.
And I'll be taking Al with me.
Since he's in that state, Scar can't use his destruction techniques on him.
Oh, how convenient.
Is it really okay, Al?
A philosopher's stone is made by sacrificing the lives of many people.
Don't worry.
Brother isn't planning to use it at all.
We're thinking that there may be a way to getour bodies back by using Eastern Alchemy from Xing.
And a little girl who can useEastern Alchemy is supposedly with Scar.
So he's making it look like he's going after Scar, but his plan is to get in touch with that girl?
That's my guess.
I see.
Then I'd better think up a good reason, too.
Huh?
We're going to head to the location Scar was last sighted.
Sounds good.
Okay, scoot in!
Al, scoot over some more!
Hey, what the heck?!
Ms. Winry, please wait at the fortress.
This isn't a game.
I know that!
But I just fixed up his automail, right?
It would be bad if it stopped working all of a sudden, so I should go along in case maintenance is needed.
If something were to happen, it would hurt the proud name of the Rockbells!
You're really into your work, aren't you?
You workaholic.
Of course I'm into it!

Okay. Very well.
I know that!
I'll allow it.
You're from a family of machine freaks.
I don't care if you call me a machine freak!
There's no knowing what will happen.
I know.
But I'm sick of sitting and waiting for something to happen.
An all-out war between chimeras and humans takes place in a mining town where the piercing wind blows.
Don't let down your guard. Give it your best.
What is the strange aftermath brought forth by the fierce battle?
Next time, Fullmetal Alchemist:
Episode 38, Clash in Baschool.
Humans let down their guard in their moments of victory.Alchemy is a science where one understands the structure of matter, breaks it down, then rebuilds it.
However, it is not an all-powerful technique,as one cannot create something out of nothing.
If one wishes to gain something,one must present something of equal value.
This is the concept of equivalent exchange, the fundamental basis of alchemy.
However, there is a taboo in alchemy. Human transmutation.
One must not commit this act.You idiot!!!
You believed the enemy's words and lost the will to fight?!
I'm terribly sorry, sir.
Don't lose your composure!
Do not simply accept death.
If you are truly my aide, then keep your head.
Yes, sir.
I'm going to continue to rely on you to watch my back. Be prepared.
You have no right to talk, Colonel.
What kind of commander wanders out in a mission like that?
Shut up!
Ow-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow...
Besides, why am I in the same room as you?!
Aren't hospital rooms supposed to be singles with beautiful nurses?
You'll have to deal with it.
It's much easier for me to guard you two if you're recovering in the same room.
That's what's worrying me.
Why haven't they come to kill us?
Why?!
Why did you let the flame guy leave alive?!
He burned Lust to death!
Lust... died...
It's not too late! Go kill him!
Roy Mustang. We can use him.
Use? Don't tell me you're going to make him open the...
Worry not.
Father put me in charge of him.
What if it's decomposed?
What?
My body on the other side of the gate hasn't taken in any nutrition!
Even if I was able to return to a body like that...
Brother! Winry!
Really, Ed?!
This is only hypothetical, but when we tried to transmute Mom,
we used our blood in the formula as information for her soul, right?
Yeah.
Then, we were both taken tothe other side and were decomposed.
I wonder if there's a possibility our minds were entangled during that process?
What do you mean?
I'm wondering if it's possible your body and I are connected in some way.
You know, for my age, I'm sh-
Sh...
Short...
He said it.
He was able to face reality.
So you're saying your growth is connected to how Al would have grown?
Sounds crazy to me.
It's not crazy!
You're short because you never drink milk.
This again?!
Of course!
Now that I think about it, Brother is always sleeping.
Could it be he's making up for my sleep, too?
Drink it!
I said, no!
Do it!
No!
It would be nice if that's the case.
Drink it!
No!
Episode 21, The Fool's Progress.
Paying the Colonel a visit?
Mr. Havoc is injured, too,so we wanted to pay them a proper visit.
I'm not sure I would be here todayif the Colonel hadn't come to our rescue.
Is that why you're here, too, Sergeant Fuery?
Running some errands for the Lieutenant.
I've calculated the approximate distance to that large door...
...by counting the steps I took since entering Research Laboratory 3's basement.
The exact direction is unclear, so I drew a circle with the laboratory at the center, and...
Central headquarters?
And to top it off, this building is...
The FÃ¼hrer President's residence.
The homunculi reside under there?
So there's a chance the FÃ¼hrer President has connections to them... eh?
If he does, then I wonder why he killed Greed and his crew?
He's still suspicious, even if he doesn't have ties to them.
He killed them all without even trying to extract information from them.
FÃ¼hrer President... He's mysterious.
Either way, the enemy has infiltrated pretty high up in the military command.
We ought to approach him with caution from now on.
Fullmetal. Take care of yourself.
Homunculi and the FÃ¼hrer President...
We were able to fish out something larger than expected.
I also have a feeling it's a bit too large...
It wouldn't be worthwhile otherwise.
Well, I have a lot of work for all of you.
Oh yeah, about that.
I won't be able to participate.
I can't... feel my legs.
I'm sorry.
Looks like an early retirement for me.
Yo.
Hey. Are you not feeling well?
Backache.
Coroners are always standing,so it's a tough job for old guys like me.
I knew right away when I heard you were the one who killed her.
What are you up to?
So you declared that thing was Second Lieutenant Ross when you knew I was up to something?
War buddies are wonderful to have.
We're not war buddies; more like accomplices in crime.
You burned them up; I dissected them.
Ishbal was a giant experimental site.
If you keep taking risks like that, you'll get tit for tat.
Already done.
Did something happen?
My comrade...
...is paralyzed from the waist down due to a spinal injury.
And I just got permission to have one smoke a day, too...
Geez, isn't that just hilarious?Getting stabbed by a woman and having to retire.
What are you going to do after you retire?
My family runs a general store.
I can at least help out by answering the phone.
Can't you get an automail?
They said it's not possible since the neural network for the entire lower half of my body is disconnected.
Retirement doesn't suit you one bit.
Colonel.
About Havoc's legs...
...here's some information I got from the Fullmetal boss.
Dr. Marcoh.
An alchemist well-versed in medicine.
A philosopher's stone?!
Would it be possible to have my vacation extended?
I permit it.
Go.
Ah, Major!
Are you back from your vacation, sir?
How was your trip to the east?
You can't tell anyone.
It was a nice place with lots of beauties.
I see...
Oh, right, Major.
This is from military police headquarters.
They want all the State Alchemists to know first.
This is...
How was it?
They let me in without objection when I told them I was a State Alchemist.
What about the entrance to the basement?
Wasn't there.
But there were traces of it being covered up with alchemy.
They're not so stupid as to leaving the entrance wide open.
I see.
I guess it's not possible for us to goand meet the homunculi from here.
They said something about not wanting me killed because I'm an important sacrifice.
They said that to me, too.
That I could become a sacrifice because I'd opened the gate.
My guess is that these sacrifices...
...are alchemists who are capable of opening the gate and returning.
What are they planning on doing by making us sacrifices?
I'll beat it out of them!
Edward!
Huh? Sergeant Brosh?
Good thing I found you!
Hey, what happened?
You ought to go back to the hotel immediately!
If you wish, I'll call for escorts!
A notification to the entire city from military police headquarters.
It seems Scar has appeared in Central once again.
Three casualties, all of whom are State Alchemists.
Several others wounded.
According to witnesses, he has a large cross-shaped scar on his forehead.
An Ishbalan with tattoos all over his right arm.
Tattoos... on his right arm!
Scar killed the Rockbells?!
It's not certain yet.
No way...
Brother, you can't tell Winry about this.
Like I could even if I wanted to.
I don't ever want to see her cry again.
Me neither.
I guess we'll have to face Scar again.
You're going to try to find out the truth?
That, too, but I have something else in mind.
We'll use him to lure out the homunculi.
Huh?
They want to keep me alive.
So if I'm attacked by Scar and in danger...
They'll show themselves?
I don't think that's very likely...
But it's better than sitting around and doing nothing.
But we were defeated by him in an instant last time!
I'm sure we've... gotten a bit stronger-
And even if the homunculi do show themselves, how do we catch them?!
Not only are they strong,but they're pretty much invincible!
Invincible?!
Which means...
Immortality, correct?!
From the window again...
We'll lend you a hand with that mission.
What?
We're not interested in all the military troubles,
but if it's about homunculi or immortality, we can talk.
Huh? Are you doubting us?
We're grateful you rescued Second Lieutenant Ross, but-
The more people by your side, the better, right?
We're serious, too.
The fate of an entire clan rests on me.
Fine.
You'd better not run off with the homunculi.
We'll keep our promise! We owe you for a meal, after all.
A meal?
Room service?
This place has great food!
"A meal" my ass!
Shut up!!!
I need to get up early tomorrow,but I can't sleep with all this noise!
Oh, that's right. So you're going back to Rush Valley tomo-
Wait, cancel the trip and stay in Central for a little longer.
What?
Well, you know. How should I put this?
My arm may break again, or more accurately... it's definitely going to break again...
You're planning to break it now?!
Oh no! Brother's soul!
Geez...
Don't do anything too dangerous, okay?
Doctor! Doctor!
Are you not in?
Dammit!
I see... Nice try, nonetheless.
A deadlock, huh...
Well, if you'll excuse me.
Who were they?
My mother and someone from the Department of Veteran Affairs.
I've completed the retirement procedures.
It hasn't been determined if you'll be able to recover, yet...
I'm not so stupid as to not understand I'm useless now.
But...
You don't need a chess piece that can't move, right?
You have no idea how pathetic of a look you have right now...
Leave me behind! Throw me away!
Do you have time to be worrying about an underling like me?!
Don't you have a promise to keep with Brigadier General Hughes?!
I don't need your sympathy!
Second Lieutenant Havoc!
Let me give it up.
I'm begging you...
All right.
I'll leave you behind.
I'll leave you behind, so you'd better catch up to me.
I'm going on ahead.
I'll be waiting for you at the top.
He didn't even abandon me;someone who tried to accept death.
He told me he'd rely on me to watch his back.
He can't throw his men away.
He's an idiot...
There's no way he can reach the top of this country with a soft attitude like that...
I think it's better for everyoneif an idiot like that exists among us.
Bring my uniform.
You're in no condition to be discharged from the hospital...
Don't make me repeat myself.
Yes, sir.
Look at what you've done!
I-I'm sorry!
I guess we have to close down for today!
Looks like you guys are in trouble!
State Alchemist, Edward Elric, to the rescue!
That was amazing, kid!
Thank you so much! How much should I pay you?
Pay?
There's absolutely no need for that!
I broke a precious jar. Could I ask you to fix it?
No problem at all!
Edward Elric!
I'm Edward Elric, your city's State Alchemist!
This, too!
Please fix it!
The whole city is talking about me.
With that flashiness, it's no surprise.
I wouldn't have expected things like this from you, Fullmetal.
Colonel?!
You're well enough to leave the hospital already?
I guess.
I heard about Second Lieutenant Havoc.
If you ask Dr. Marcoh, he can probably...
Hold that thought.
We're in public.
Get in.
On second thought, get out...
Dr. Marcoh is missing?!
He was probably abducted by them.
By the way, Fullmetal.
You've heard about Scar, right?
Why are you doing things that will just catch his eye?
I want him to find me.
I need to fight him again.
Don't be stupid!
Did you forget what happened to you in East City?!
Oh my! Afraid of Scar now, are we?
You were pretty much uselesslast time, if I remember correctly!
Don't underestimate me! The weather's fine today!
On top of that, you're exhausted!
You really are useless, aren't you?!
Shut up!
Now look! He's here!
What's wrong? It's not even raining, but you look pretty drenched.
Hang on, Lieutenant!
Don't shoot.
What are you saying?!
I just thought I'd try fishing like the Colonel likes to.
We're going to drag out the homunculi, using Brother as bait!
Since Brother is an important sacrifice and they want him alive!
This is reckless...
We don't want any more casualties!
So either me or Brother have to be the bait!
What if Scar gets shot to death by themilitary police before the homunculi come out?
You can take care of that, right, Colonel?
Ordering me about now, are we?
You've got some guts.
If you do capture the homunculi, give me a crack at them!
Roger!
Sergeant Fuery's second home is nearby.
Let's go!
Roger.
It's begun.
You two! Please back away!
Don't shoot! You'll hit Brother!
Dammit... if Scar gets shot, it's all over!
Not being too close or too far is a pain!
When are you going to get here, homunculi?!
The channel for the military police headquarters is...
Got it.
Nothing less to be expected from Fuery.
3rd District Military police unit reporting.
We are currently fighting Scar.
Requesting reinforcements immediately!
Y-You! What... are you doing?!
All right, the 17th district next.
This is getting kind of fun.
This is-
What the hell is going on?!
Scar is in the 17th district, too?!
Then what was with the 3rd district?!
Colonel Douglas! He's shown himself in 8th district, as well!
What?!
This is the Central military police headquarters, reporting to the 8th district.
Scar and a boy are engaged in combat!
The boy is a State Alchemist.
Do not shoot.
There are false reports all over the place!
A fourth Scar?! What the hell?!
This is the 3rd district! Everything is in order!
This is the 8th district! We've found Scar! Requesting reinforcements immediately!
Gluttony.
I can smell it. I can smell him!
The scent of that Ishbalan!
I sense something... Did you, Lan Fan?
Yes.
All right, let's go!
Which is he after?!
Human destruction or my automail?!
Brother!
I got lucky...
He canceled out the decomposition energy?!
So reckless...
Tattoos on his right arm!
Bastard...
So it 
I can smell it. I can smell him!
Hey, how's it going?
You have a strange interior.
How many people do you have inside you?
Who?
There's no point in trying to run.
I can sense your distinct aura from a mile away!
Enemy? Enemy?
Can I eat you?
As I thought!
A homunculus!
Oh? You can sense us?
A troublesome ability.
I'll eliminate you!
Lan Fan!
Run!
Lan Fan!!!
The shriek of the hurt girl echoes throughout Central.
When the trampling force meets his past again,
memories of violence are awakened.
Next time, Fullmetal Alchemist:
Episode 22, The Distant Backside.
"I want to protect her."
That was the thought in the boy's mind.Fullmetal!
He disappeared?!
What did you do?!
He was simply escorted to a placeyou'll eventually arrive at yourself.
What the hell is this?
This sensation...
That's right!
The same sensation I got when I opened the Gate of Truth!
Episode 58, Human Sacrifices.
Dammit!
You son of a bitch!
You're...!
Idiot!
Leave this place to us!
It's our duty...
...to protect the young master.
It's impossible to carry this much weight with an automail!
Worry about your grandfather instead!
It's...
...too late.
Briggs soldiers, lend me a hand!
Right!
Bradley, eat this!
Fu!
Fu!!
Someone call a doctor!
Are there any doctors well-versed in alchemy?!
I've...
I've got a philosopher's stone right here!
Use as much of it as you need!
Anyone!
Please!
Isn't Amestris the land of alchemy?!
There's gotta be someone here!
Hey!!
Why...?
Why...
Young master!
You monster...
Why...
I can't save a single vassal despite achieving immortality...?
Fuck!!
Captain!
Captain, get yourself together!
Captain!
Captain!!
Captain!!
Fire!
We were able to give Bradley a fatal wound thanks to you.
Even though you ensured that Fu's death would not be in vain,
I can't even do a thing to help you.
Give me ammo!
That was the last round!
Shit!
I'm out too!
Everyone, fire back with your rifles!
Roger!
Ling Yao...
Or Greed, whichever you are...
If you're truly thankful, would you mind doing me a favor?
We're not supposed to let this gate open until our Queen orders it to be.
Please, protect it...
It should be possible with your strength...
No, only you... can do it...
I'm begging you...
Greed.
Yo?
I want power.
Lend me some.
Sure thing.
We've still got some time until my next plan.
Lan Fan, you protect the people here.
Roger!
Could you... do that for me?
Yeah, I promise.
People from Xing...
...never break alliances!
Fire! Fire!
W-Who the hell is that?!
All right, listen up!
Those who don't wish to get hurt,
and those who have family and lovers, stand back!
And women, too!
I don't particularly enjoy fighting women!
No way...!
Fire!!
Incredible...
Ling Yao.
Or should I say, homunculus?
How promising they are once you have one on your side...
Captain!
Captain!
Captain, please hang in there!
Did he... join our side?
Yes, sir!
Now I can kick the bucket in peace...
What are you saying, Captain?!
Major General Armstrong will achieve victory soon!
Just a little longer!
We need you to take an even more active role in Central than ever before!
I don't like the sooty sky here in Central...
Farewell, comrades...
I'll go on ahead...
...to an even higher place than the summit of Briggs...
Captain Buccaneer!!!
What was that flash of light from before?
There hasn't been a single announcement.
What's going on with military headquarters?
No follow-up reports from Radio Capital?
Nope.
What about the other stations?
They're just announcing a curfew for the moment.
Mommy!
The radio tells us we can't go outside,
so let's hold off on going to Tabasa's house today, okay, Elicia?
What?!
We can see the solar eclipse from here, too.
It's about to begin,
so let's watch it from here with Mommy.
Izumi!
Where are you?!
Izumi!!
Alex, do you know what just happened?
I heard this from the Elric Brothers in the past.
They said that when they performed human transmutation,
they were dragged into the Gate of Truth by black hands.
What is this "Gate of Truth" you speak of?
I have no idea.
What did you say?!
Were you able to get in touch with them?
Major General, headquarters is safe.
Good.
And, did you obtain any information pertaining to Miss Izumi's situation?
No...
I see...
And what else?
During a battle with King Bradley,
Captain Buccaneer, who was defending the main gate,
lost his life along with a few other men.
It has been reported that the captain,working together with someone from Xing,
successfully gave Bradley a fatal wound and knocked him down into a canal.
Impossible!
There's no way that can be true!
How could that King Bradley die so easily?!
He's not human-
And what about the main gate?
It's still being defended.
A homunculus by the name of Greed joined their side,
and tore apart the central soldiers at the main gate.
A homunculus?!
Impossible.
A homunculus would never turn its fangs on that man...
Apparently, Captain Buccaneer passed away with a smile.
I see.
If he died with a smile, we can't sit here and weep.
Let's proceed!
Roger!
Let's go, Mr. Sig.
We also need to look for your wife.
Right.
Ouch...
Oww...
Master!
Ed!
Are you okay?!
Yeah, somewhat.
What are you doing here?
That's what I want to know.
So, where are we?
I don't know.
I was just sent here all of a sudden...
Al!
Al!
Hey!
Even Al?
Get yourself together!
Could it be that all the human sacrifices were gathered?
What's wrong, Al?!
Hey!
One, two, three...
...and four.
We're missing one.
I guess the last one is currently being made.
W-What the hell is this monster?
Hohenheim!
Edward...
Even Alphonse was captured...?
Whoa, Miss Izumi as well.
Sorry I'm in such a pitiful state.
What in the world is going on?
Well...
You stay put.
I'll slowly absorb the philosopher's stone inside you later.
Who the hell is that dark guy, Hohenheim?!
My alter ego.
The guy who the homunculi called 'Father'.
That's the geezer?!
Yeah.
I was able to destroy his skin, but...
Quit your blabbering, Hohenheim.
I welcome you, human sacrifices.
Thanks for coming to my castle.
Al, wake up.
This one's going to be tough.
Al?
Hey, Al!
Alphonse!
The ones up there are so unreliable.
They couldn't even prepare five human sacrifices for this day?
Well, I gathered all the ones who've been seeking morsels like immortality,
so it's no surprise that they couldn't do their jobs.
Damn you!
Excellent. Stay just like that.
Now, Mustang, we don't have much time.
I'd appreciate it if you could willingly cooperate with me.
Do you mind performing human transmutation and opening the gate?
What?
I don't care who you transmute.
Your late parents, your lover, your friend.
The one you were close to...
What was his name again?
Hughes.
I don't mind if you transmute him.
We'll take care of all the arrangements.
The ones you call... "human sacrifices"?
Precisely.
Those who open the gate can become human sacrifices.
So that's why the Elric Brothers were chosen.
Yup.
I heard from them that human transmutation doesn't work.
What idiot would try it when they know it's not going to work?!
Good point there.
So as long as you open the gate and come back, it's fine.
I refuse!
I won't perform human transmutation!
I won't open the gate either!
Didn't I tell you that we don't have much time?
Lieutenant!
Lieutenant?!
Lieutenant!
Now, open the gate, Mustang.
You scum!!
Lieutenant! Can you hear me?!
Say something!
Now, perform human transmutation and become the fifth sacrifice.
Come on, if you don't pick up the pace, this woman will die.
Oh, I get it.
You're going to transmute her back after she dies?
That's fine too.
I won't die...
I've been ordered not to die...
If one could obtain an immortal body with an order like that,
everyone would live without worry.
What will you do, Mustang?
A woman who's precious to you is dying.
If you leave her be, she'll die from blood loss.
But I'm a doctor well-versed in alchemy,
and tadaa, I even have a philosopher's stone.
In other words, I can save this woman's life.
Well, if she dies before you make a decision, there'll be nothing I can do.
Oh?
She's gotten quiet.
I wonder if she died.
Colonel...
There's no need... for you to perform human transmutation.
You'll do it, won't you, Mustang?
Now!
I will.
There may be a moment of upturn, but know this:
It is just a momentary break.
The gate to the afterlife is where you belong.
Next time, Fullmetal Alchemist:
Episode 59, Lost Light.
The end is near.Resembool! We're in Resembool!
So what exactly are the Colonel's orders?
Can't you tell me already, Major?
I don't know many of the details, either.
I was simply told to bring you along to Resembool to meet up with the others.
Meet up with who?
Good day, Major Armstrong.
And...
Episode 18, The Arrogant Palm of a Puny Human.
Yo, Boss.
Second Lieutenant Breda?!
Brother should have arrived in Resembool a while ago...
...but he still hasn't called...
And besides, I'm here if he needs to have his arm repaired.
There's so much we don't know,including Second Lieutenant Ross' case...
Which is why I'm here to explain.
S-Since when?!
Where did you even come in from?!
The window.
I'm technically a criminal, after all.
SMUGGLED INTO THE COUNTRY
AND
BROKE OUT OF JAIL
Well, you guys don't need to worry about Edward.
Right now, he's probably...
So hot...
That damn Colonel... he didn't mention a word about us having to leave the country...
Mr. Han, are we almost there?
We've been here for a while now.
See? The Xerxes ruins.


Why is the brat with you?
For certain reasons.
Xerxes, huh...
I remember reading about it inthe tale about the Sage of the East.
Sage of the East?
Yeah.
A fairy tale about the alchemist who introduced alchemy to our country.
It's a legend about the sole survivor of theXerxes Kingdom, which was destroyed in one night,
and how he arrived in Amestris, just recently foundedat that time, and spread alchemy throughout the country.
In our country, there's a legend stating he arrived from the west.
Eastern alchemy as we know it today is a combination of the skills he brought us and Xing's technology.
Oh, the one developed as a method of healing?
That's right.
We refer to him with respect,
as the "Sage of the West".
And this is where that sage was from?
That's what's been told.
Wow...
I wanted to see the Xerxes ruins.
Now I see why...
But I wonder if it's truly possible for them to be destroyed in one night despite having advanced technology like this.
It could just be a legend.
What are you doing?
This way.
We're going in pretty deep, aren't we...
Edward!
Eastern Headquarters, where I used to be stationed, was great. 
It lacks the bustle of large cities,and most of all, there are so many beauties. 
That stupid colonel!
Second Lieutenant Ross!!!
Now, for the embrace of reunion!!!
I'll pass!
Second Lieutenant Ross!
There's no telling when we'd get caught if a dead person was walking around the country, so we had her flee.
So the Colonel knew all alongSecond Lieutenant Ross was innocent?
Don't you think they're being a bit too flashy?
You think so, too?
Yes.
Hauling her down to the police station in front of a crowd...
Murdering a colleague is an embarrassment to the military, and yet, to have it make headlines...
It's me.
A call from Warrant Officer Falman on a general line, sir.
Put it through.
Colonel! About the murder of Brigadier General Hughes...
Hey Falman! Let me talk to him for a bit.
Barry?!
Yo, Mr. Mustang! Did you see the paper?
I've got something interesting to tell you.
Hey, Barney! You shouldn't use this line for private use!
I'll call you back from outside my office, so hang tight!
What? Is that true?
Yeah, the bullet the lieutenant used was the one she shot me with.
I still have the hole in my right hand.
I think we can set something up...
Huh?
Barry, don't you miss going on rampages?
Roger. I won't kill.
The second passage to the warehouse district, right?
Breda, go find these ingredients right away.
Pork bones and meat, carbon, ammonia.
What's all this for?
I'm going to whip up a burnt corpse.
H-Human transmutation?!
Don't be stupid.
It's going to be something that resembles a burnt corpse.
But if the medical examiner looks closely...
I'm going to burn it up so badly they won't even be able to have it appraised.
But what will you do if they decide to check the treatment marks on her teeth?
It's all under control.
Will you be able to do it?
I'm no expert, but I do know enough to make it happen.
I'm also good at transmuting burnt corpses.
Hurry!
You're Maria Ross, right?
It's a dummy.
You're going to die here tonight.
Don't just sit there.
Oww...
Yo, Fullmetal. 
What's the meaning of this, Colonel?! 
Huh? Was that the fullmetal boss?
That's not good... this was unexpected.
Edward...
Well, the Colonel will take care of it.
Let's go.
Roger.
While Barry was helping Ms. Ross break out of jail,he made a deal with the Young Master.
And the Young Master commanded me to escort her to the east.
And we promised him we'd meet here to set Second Lieutenant Ross free.
I see.
I still don't like it...
It means the bastard colonel pulled a fast one on us, right?
It's more convincing to actually have you see her than to explain it in words, right?
I know, I know.
The Colonel is totally right this time.
Speaking of the Colonel...
I also recall him saying, "Having a pissed-off brat around the place would just be a total nuisance to the mission!"
That damned colonel!!!
What is this mission you speak of?
Is there something else to do aside from rescuing Second Lieutenant Ross?
Yes.
We decided to fish out the mastermind hiding within the military.
Next time I see him...
Fish out?
Barry, who knows the secret behindResearch Laboratory 5, went out and made a mess.
They'll definitely come to shut him up for good.
So that's how it was.
So the only reason they took Ed was because he'd be a nuisance?
I guess you could say that.
And I lent them a hand in exchange for Barry telling me the secret to his body.
But it turns out...
The scientist who turned me into this is long dead, so I don't really know.
What?! That's not fair!
Oh yeah, that Alphonse guy is kind of in the same boat as me, so why don't you try asking him?
So I decided to come to you instead.
It's a promise, so I'm counting on you!
Umm... I really don't have anything to do with that promise...
I really have nothing to do with this, do I...
Philosopher's stones... Homunculi...
I wonder why I was dragged into all this.
Now we have quite a bit of information.
If we discover the truth behind the murder of the Brigadier General, the situation will change, too.
We'll definitely prove you were falsely accused.
Lieute- Brigadier General Hughes...
He's really gone, isn't he...
What do you plan to do now?
Move forward on the path you're content with. 
We have someone who's willing to collaborate with us, even though we committed taboo...
We also have someone who'll scold and support us...
I have a younger brother who I made a promise with... to return to our bodies...
I also don't have anywhere to return...
With that said, I have no choice but to move forward...
In a way that won't cause a single death of anyone important to me.
If it seems someone is going to be victimized, I'll protect them.
It may be difficult.
It's hard enough keeping my own head, but protecting others, too...
It may be arrogant of me,
but this is the only thing I can think of,
so I'm going to move forward.
Second Lieutenant Ross, what do you plan to do now?
I plan to go to the country of Xing.
Should I at least let your parents know?
No.
If it happens that information about me being alive is leaked from my parents, it'd be irreparable.
I see.
Major Armstrong. Second Lieutenant Breda.
Hm?
Please pass a message to Colonel Mustang for me.
"I greatly appreciate you saving me."
Ask him to order me back in the case of emergency.
I will gladly risk my life to assist him if that ever happens!
I will.
Stay well, Edward.
I never got you back for that slap.
Maybe next time.
Yeah. Maybe next time.
You have good friends.
Mr. Fu, what is Xing like?
It's a pleasant country, with great food and nice people.
There's no need to worry.
So I can expect a paradise after crossing this desert, right?
You sure can.
However, crossing this desert is a cruel task in itself.
Careful.
You should conserve your fluids.
I'll drop by your store tomorrow.
What do you want as your gift, Elizabeth?
Pardon me, Roy.
Kate, we have customers.
Could you go get Jacquelyn?
Jacquelyn, we have customers.
Roger.
Whoa!
Barry!
Calm down, Falman.
You can't kill this one!
This smell of cigarettes...
Second Lieutenant Havoc?!
Hey! What do you think I'm disguised for?!
This is why I can't stand guys who aren't used to battles!
I-I'm sorry, sir!
You were only "dragged in".
So don't attack him.
Someone from the army could be watching us at any moment.
You...
We're heading outside!
But there may be enemies outside!
We don't have to worry about that.
Shit!
Second Lieutenant!
Don't worry, we have the hawkeye on our side.
I just heard a loud noise. Is something wrong?
Nothing at all.
The customer played a prank on Jacquelyn, so I hit him a little.
Oh my.
You're harsh, Elizabeth.
All right, don't move.
We have a lot to ask you... er...
Does he understand what we're saying?
You've gotta be kidding me...
This is...
That's my body!!!
What?! How could this be?!
They threw in some kind of experimental animal or a soul inside my body!
And now, he's here to get his soul back!
This brings back so many memories!
I haven't seen it since I had my soul pulled out of me!
A transmutation circle.
It's similar to the one I saw in Research Laboratory 5.
A two-headed dragon... A sun...
Agh, dammit! The top part's gone, so I can't tell anything!
Need something from me?
If it's money, I don't-
An Ishbalan?
Young lad, would you become a hostage in order for us to get our holy land back from the army?
There's no way the army would give in for one kid like me.
The civil war began with the death of a child, as well.
We don't know what could bethe beginning of a change in history.
Cut it out; this is disgraceful.
Lady Shan!
You idiots...
Are you trying to bring shame to the Ishbalan name?
Could you let that man go?He won't try to harm you anymore.
Why did you save me?
Don't you all hate Amestrians?
I know that not all Amestrians are evil.
Both Lady Shan and I were saved by Amestrian doctors when we were badly injured during the civil war.
In all honesty, we despise your kind, but I wouldn't be here today if it weren't for that couple.
Couple?
Could you be talking about the Rockbells?!
You know Doctor Rockbell?
Y-Yeah...
The doctor saved so many of us Ishbalans.
I see...
So Uncle and Aunt Rockbell...
They stayed with us, despite the war getting worse and worse.
How were their last moments?
They were killed by an Ishbalan...
...an Ishbalan patient they saved.
No way...
We're so sorry...
We couldn't stop him.
Who was it?!
I couldn't see his face.
But he was an Ishbalan with a tattoo on his right arm.
When you get the chance, please convey our feelings to their gravestones.
Both our gratitude... and our apologies...
This is just grand!
This is like the once-in-a-lifetime chance for me to cut up my own body as much as I want!
You told me earlier not to kill him!
To hell with this mission!
My soul keeps shaking... It wants to cut him up!
You can't do that.
Besides, wouldn't the normal approach to this be wishing to go back inside your old body?
That body won't last much longer.
Oh, so it's rotten...
I can't stand it anymore!!!
I'm going to cut him up!
I get to decide what to do with my own body!
I said, no!
What's wrong?
I wonder if it's a fight?
Seems like there's some trouble between her and the customer.
Oops, I'm going to have to call you back.
I've got a customer, too.
She's a strong, proud woman.
A beautiful woman, loved by her comrades.
But her weapon which shoots down enemies has lost its power, and her flame of life fleetingly went out.
Next time, Fullmetal Alchemist:
Episode 19, Death of the Undying.
She becomes anguished.Her memories bring about her suffering.Marcoh, the man who Ed and Al met, possesseda philosopher's stone, although it was incomplete.
Moved by Ed's passion, Marcoh revealed the location his research data was hidden.
And so, after having his automail repaired,Ed stood before the place Marcoh's data was located...
National Central Library, 1st Branch.
Dr. Marcoh's research data!!!
It was too much effort to look for it,so I just burnt down the whole building.
What did you do at Central?
That's exactly what I've been explaining to you!
The Fullmetal boy found out about Marcoh's data.
After I took care of that, I came back to East City to check on things, but...
How's he doing?
Gluttony?
I can smell... I can smell it.
There's an Ishbalan nearby that smells like blood.
Can I eat him?
Sure, but eat every bit of him.
Episode 7, The Hidden Truth.
There have been no sightings of Scarsince the case involving the Elric brothers.
Maybe he's not in East City anymore?
I need him to be here.
Huh?
If I can solve the case that was left unresolved in Central, it should raise my status in the public's eye.
I'll take advantage of everything I can.
Until I become the FÃ¼hrer and gain full authority over the military, that is.
You ought to refrain from making inappropriate remarks.
Yeah, I'll try.
Excuse me, sir!
There has been a report of an explosion by Merle River!
What?!
A gas explosion?
No idea.
It's been so unsafe lately.
This belongs to Scar. There's no mistaking it.
Have any bodies been found?
We've been searching, but...
In any case, judging from this blood, it is safe to assume that he's dead.
But still, we cannot let our guard down until we confirm his death.
Second Lieutenant Havoc.
Sir?
Your squad is to clear all of the rubble.
There will be no breaks, whether it be for lunch or supper.
Drag his body out, no matter what it takes.
Give us a break.
Are you trying to kill us?
Shut up!
I can't even calm myself for a date until I see his dead body with my own eyes.
Yeah, okay.
He got away.
I didn't get to eat him...
There, there, maybe next time.
Well, he probably won't be able to do anything for a while after all that.
I'm going back to Central again.
I need to report to Father about Scar.
Everything's been burnt to a crisp.
Major Armstrong!
Ah, 2nd Lt. Ross and Sergeant Brosh.
What's the matter?
We've received orders from Headquarters to report.
We will take over the escort of Sir Edward Elric.
All right, understood.
What the heck?! Just when I thought I'd get rid of this smothering guy for good, I get more escorts?!
There is someone well-versed in the data that was in the Library's 1st Branch.
Although she is no longer employed...
Looks like I shouldn't expect much.
Can I help you?
U-Umm...
Pardon my impudence, but why are you wearing a suit of armor?
Just a hobby!
"Hobby"? Second Lieutenant, what kind of hobby is it?!
What's wrong with these kids?!
Man, Al, the scenery is great!
You're right, Brother!
Wha-
What's with these mountains of books?!
Is there really someone living here?
Miss Sheska, are you in?
Miss Sheska!
Someone...
Help me...
Huh?
Hm?
Brother, someone...
Someone is buried under the books!
Dig! Dig! Dig! Dig over here!

Hang in there!
Idiot!!
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!
I carelessly knocked over a mountain of books...
I thought that was the end for me!
Thank you so much!
So you're Sheska?
Yes.
The one who was at the 1st Branch?

1st Branch!
Ah, even the name gives off a sweet sound!
I've always loved books ever since I was born, and I felt like I was being sent to Heaven when I got a job there.
But I forgot that I was at work and was fired because I was reading all the time.


Even though I need a job to sendmy sick mother to a better hospital...
Seriously... I've got no skills besides reading, and I can't find a job no matter where I go...
That's right! I'm a failure! I'm the trash of society!
Umm... I've got something I want to ask you...
Yes?
Do you happen to know of anyresearch documents by Tim Marcoh?
Tim Marcoh... Tim Marcoh...
Oh! Yes, I do remember!
Really?!
I remember it clearly because it was handwritten and shoved into a shelf in the wrong section.
So it really was there...
...which means that it's ashes now...
Did you want to read the research?
Yeah, but it's gone now...
Sorry to bother you.
I remember everything in it, though.
What?!
W-Well, I remember the content of every book that I've ever read.
It'll take a while, but would you like me to transcribe it?

Thank you so much, bookworm!
...Worm?
Here is the duplicate of Mr. Tim Marcoh's research!
Sorry, it took five days because there was just so much to write down.
There really are amazing people in this world, aren't there, Brother?
Is this really Dr. Marcoh's research?
Yes! No doubt about it!
"1000 Meals for Daily Living", written by Tim Marcoh.
Huh?
"Add a bit of water to a tablespoon of sugar"...
These really are 1000 meals for daily living.
Hey! What part this makes it an important document?!
But... all I did was copy things down exactly as I'd remembered!
Looks like we just went on a wild goose chase.
This is word for word what Dr. Marcoh wrote, right?
Yes! Without a doubt.
You're amazing. Thanks a lot.
Okay! Let's take this back to the Central Library.
Yeah. They've got a lot of related books there, too.
Yep.
Oops. I need to reward you for all that work.
2nd Lt. Ross, this is my registration codeand silver pocket watch as ID.
Withdraw the amount written on there frommy annual research expenditures and give it to Sheska.
Okay, so I just have to go to the State Alchemist Facility at the FÃ¼hrer administrative building, right?
Yep!
Thanks again, Sheska!
Later!
Hmm, so from his research expenditures...
What's with this number?!
He can just pull out a sum like this as if it's nothing?! What is that boy?!
Are these recipes really research documents for alchemy?
Alchemy is dangerous when abused.
To prevent that, alchemists encrypt their research.

Basically, it's an advanced alchemy document.
How are you going to decipher itif only the author can understand it?
Knowledge and inspiration.
The rest of it will all be busy work with patience.
Wow, this'll take a while...
Al, there's something about a pigeon dish!
Pigeon? Could that be...
Yeah.
It could be about the Green Lion. The philosopher's moon.
Did you bring Flamel's manuscriptsor books on Lambspring's philosopher's stone?
Of course!
Great. Hey, look here.
Hmm?
This has to do with it, too, doesn't it?
Yeah, you're right! This one, too.
Yep. All right, let's give it a shot!
Why is this encryption hard as hell...
Don't you think it'll be faster to just ask Dr. Marcoh himself...
No! If we ask him, we lose!
Is that the problem here?
Umm...
Sheska.
I was able to transfer my mother to a wonderful hospital thanks to you.
I really appreciate it.
No problem at all.
Any progress on the decoding?
Have you found a job?
But thanks to you two, I realized that even a failure like me can be useful to others.
Thank you so much.
You're not a failure at all.
I believe being able to wholeheartedly commit yourself to something is a talent in itself,
and you have an amazing memory.
You should have more confidence in yourself.
Thanks.
Yo!
Lt. Colonel Hughes!
I heard from Major Armstrong you guys were back.
Come on... I told you guys to comesay hi when you stopped by Central again.
Sorry, I had urgent matters to take care of.
Yeah, I've been kind of busy too...
He's chatting to Lt. Colonel Hughes like they're buddies!
What are those boys?
There's been a lot of incidents and such lately.
The case with Tucker and the chimera hasn't been solved yet, either...
Oh... sorry.
I made you remember it.
Well, you know.
It's busy enough, and the 1st Branch of the library just had to burn down.
The 1st Branch?
Yeah. We kept a lot of case records and whatnot in the archives, so it really messes with our job.
Hm? What?
What do you think, Lt. Colonel?
This woman is looking for a job.
Yes, I have read army criminal records and remember them, but...
All right! Let's get you set up right away!
We pay really well!
That's... umm...
Thank you very much!
I'm going to have more confidence in myself, and I'll try my best.
Thank you so much!
Come on! I need you to get to work right away.
What is he, a kidnapper?
"I believe being able to wholeheartedly commit yourself to something is a talent in itself", huh...
Wise words, little bro.
I really feel that way, especially when I look at a certain someone.
Then that certain someone's going to keep working hard.
Oops.
Closing time.
It's been ten days already.
I can't believe they have the fortitudeto work every day until this place closes.
Bullshit!!!
Sibling fight?
You shouldn't get desperate simply because you can't solve it...
We did solve it.
We solved the code.
Seriously? That's great!
Hell no, it's not great!
"The Devil's research"...
"Something you mustn't desire"...
I resent you, Dr. Marcoh...
What... exactly...
The ingredients of philosopher's stones...
...are live humans.
And on top of that, you need several sacrifices just to refine one stone.
I would have never thought something so inhumane was going on in the army...
That's something that can't be forgiven.
Could you please not tell anyone about this?
But...
Please!
Forget about it.
What...
The Elric brothers have locked themselves in their room again today?
Yes. They haven't eaten much, either.
Perhaps they were really tired?
Seems they've been working extremely hard these past days, too.
I mean, if 
Even I start feeling sick when I start thinking about it.
What is it?
N-Nothing!
Sounds fishy!
Brother, go get something to eat.
I'm not hungry.
This is tough.
Yeah.
It's like...
Right when you get within arm's reach, it runs away...
...and when you finally grab it, it kicks you down.
God must really hate humans who have committed taboo.
I wonder if we'll be like this for the rest of our lives...
Hey... there's something I've always wanted to ask you...
...but I've been too scared to.
What is it?
Elric brothers! You're there, aren't you?
It's me. Open up!
What should we do...
Just ignore him.
I heard the whole story, Edward Elric!
What a tragedy!
To think that such a horrifying secret laid beneath the philosopher's stone!
S... Sorry...
Not much we could do when sucha smothering person approaches you...
To think the army had been doing such a thing...
The truth can be cruel at times.
Truth...
What's wrong, Brother?
Do you remember Dr. Marcoh's words?
Huh?
"You may be able to reachthe real truth that is beyond truth..."
The real truth beyond truth...
Same as a research document for alchemy.
What can be seen from the outside is only a portion of the truth.
There's still something else!
Something...
There are currently four alchemy research laboratories owned by the government within Central.
The one Dr. Marcoh belonged to is Research Laboratory 3.
This one is the most suspicious.
We went around to every research lab in the city,but this one wasn't particularly...
This. What's this building?
That would be Research Laboratory 5,but it's not being used right now.
No one is allowed to enter it due to risk of collapse.
This is the place.
What makes you say that?
There's a prison right next to it.
And...
Do you remember what's needed to create philosopher's stones?
Umm... was it live humans...
There are bound to be people on the death row at the prison.
They tell the public they were executed, and...
Don't tell me... the prisoners are the ingredients?
Don't make that face.
I don't want to think about it, either.
The prison is under a differentjurisdiction, but if it's involved...
Does this mean the government has something to do with it?
I feel like I've stuck my nose into something horrible...
That's why we asked you to forget about it!
This may turn into a political matter.
I'll look into it.
But until then, the 2nd Lt. andthe Sergeant are not to speak of it!
Yes, sir!
You two better not do anything, either.
You two were thinking of sneaking into the building to check it out, weren't you!!
We weren't! We weren't!
We were.
A guard at an unused building, eh?
Pretty suspicious.
How should we get in?
How about we just make an entrance?
They'll notice the flash of the transmutation response.
In that case...
Here we... go!
This place is completely shut down, too.
Al, wait here.
Will you be all right on your own?
Either way, you can't get through here with that big body of yours, can you?
Not like I chose to have a big body!

66.
What, 48?
Our first guest in quite a while.
What a reckless dumbass.
This is narrower than I'd thought, dammit.
I probably wouldn't have been able to get through if I was normal-sized.
Good thing I'm small.
Crap! I called myself small!!!
The lights are on.
Not being used right now my ass.
Bingo.
Brother sure is taking his time...
There was a man who held pride in his swordsmanship,
and there was also another man who understood he was a heretic.
The residents of darkness jeer, andthe blades that drank blood are shrieking.
Next time, Fullmetal Alchemist:
Episode 8, Research Laboratory 5.

Poswell.
Linemile.

I'm sorry... I need to use you.
Episode 36, Family Portrait.

Why don't you just give them a pat?
They're your kids, aren't they?
I don't want them to become monsters like me.
Geez, if it were something you could "catch" like a cold, I would have become one a long time ago.
I've witnessed many deaths since gaining this body.
But I was able to suppress the sadness by telling myself that death is just a speck in the grand scheme of things.

That's how it's always been for me.
Until I met you and had kids, Trisha.
I never age, but I'm watchingmy kids age and grow like trees...
I'm terrified all of a sudden.
It reminds me that I truly am a monster.
Dear!
Dear, come here for a second!
What is it?
Good day, sir.
A photographer?
Try to look nice, now.
We've never taken a family portrait before, have we?
But this is so sudden...
Hold on to Ed.
Okay...
We're ready now.
Please take the picture.
I don't like this...
Face this way, please.
Don't move, okay?
You know... someday, I'll turn into a wrinkled old woman who looks like a monster.
But no matter how I end up looking, I'll always be happy to take a picture with the family where everyone is smiling.
So please... stay with your family.
Don't distance yourself from us and leave us alone.
Don't hurt yourself by saying you're a monster.
Okay! Say cheese!
Smile, Dear.
I was planning to accept this body and continue living like this.
But I've changed my mind.
I want to age and die with Trisha and the kids.
That bastard...
That should do it...
What were you doing up there?
Fixing the swing.
You're not really used to these things, are you?
I couldn't do a single thing for them, so I wanted to at least do this.
Trisha, I'm going.
Please wait for me.
Okay.
Don't tell the kids about my body.
Sure.
Don't you want to say goodbye to them?
If I see their faces, I'll...
You blockhead. It's okay if you cry.
H-Hey, why are you two up so early?
Al says he needs to go pee...
Oh, so you were looking after Al.
Thank you, Ed.
Just a bit longer.
Any luck?
No, I still can't reach them.
This isn't good... we can't contact the guys at base.
What now? Should we keep going?
There should be an exit somewhere to toss the rubble that was dug out.
Let's keep going for just a bit.
Smith, you go back to report on the situation.
Roger!
What's wrong?
Spread out!
Are you interested in a perfect, immortal army?
He fell for it!
No death, no decay...
Aren't you interested?
I want to cut him to pieces!
It's just that the idea is so wild; I don't know how to respond.
There are only two choices:You're either interested, or you're not.
I'm intrigued.
So when that day comes, not just I,but my men will also be able to benefit from this?
When that day comes, yes.
So he can't guarantee that much, huh...
If I accept their offer, they'll force me to assist them in causing a bloodbath at Briggs.
And if I decline, they'll put someone else in charge of the base, and I'll most likely be demoted or reassigned.
Now, I wonder what my best option is...
Pardon me.
What is it?
I'm sorry to bother you, ma'am!
The advance unit that went into the underground tunnel-
What about the underground tunnel?
It's okay. Say it.
Roger.
Something has happened to them.
Understood. I'll be right there.
I'll go, too.
All right, let's move.
Hang on!
We'll need to be tied up, right?
What's all this, Buccaneer?
I'm currently transferring the Elric Brothers from the east cells to the west cells, sir!
Who is that gentleman, if I may ask?
Solf J. Kimblee.
He's Lieutenant General Raven's guest.
Kimblee... So he's the Crimson Alchemist.
The Elric Brothers... So you must be the Fullmetal Alchemist.
Now I see why you were given that name.
Oh... it's you.
It's been a while since anyone's made that mistake!
Nice to meet you, Fullmetal Alchemist.
Likewise.
General!
What happened?
We've lost contact with the platoon that went to investigate the tunnel.
And soon after, Smith's horse came back with an arm presumed to be his.
Just his arm?
What about his body?
Missing, ma'am.
The horse he was on is too worked upand can no longer be used.
Henshel, send in a rescue party imme-
This isn't good, Major General Armstrong.
That hole is far too dangerous.
What did you do with that biological weapon you were talking to me about?
Put him back into the tunnel andcover up the hole, Major General.
But our men are still-
I'm talking to the Major General.
Isn't that the law here?
Obey the ones with power, Major General Armstrong.
I'm Raven from Central.
I've heard everything from the FÃ¼hrer President.
Pleasure to meet you.
It seems you've been keeping your mouths shut.
We promised, after all.
You don't seem too happy.
Wouldn't it be strange to be happy after having people taken hostage?
Umm... when can we get out of here?
The deal was that we'd be able to continueour journey as long as we didn't get in your way.
Don't worry, I'll get you out of here soon.
That hole... it's also a part of your plan, isn't it?
If they find out...
You don't need to worry about that, either.
Major General Armstrong agreed to returningthe homunculus in the tunnel and sealing the hole.
The Major General joined forces with us, too.
General!
Aren't we going to search for the missing unit?
Silence, Henshel.
But they may still be alive and need assistance!
I said, silence!
Shut up and obey.
"Obey the ones with power", eh?
So even the impregnable "Northern Wall of Briggs" has to give in to authority.
Well, that's the smart approach to things.
Oh? So that's the...
Good morning, Sloth.
Did you sleep well?
Who are you?
I'm still sleepy...
Hey, now. You still have some work to do.
Didn't Pride tell you so?
Pride?
It's a drag... but I have to do it...
What a drag...
Why was it a drag again?
Trying to remember is a pain...
No need to worry.
He's a chimera that's performing a task for the Central Army.
He's working to make this country stronger.
But it's still a top-secret mission.
Now, cover up this hole, my friends at Briggs.
You all are kindred spirits who I've shared my secrets with!
The essential parts have been replaced with ancient Ishbalan, so I can't read it.
I guess we can't help that, huh...
If Scar were here, we might be able to figure it out.
If he's an Ishbalan monk, there's a chance he'd know the ancient language.
I wonder if something happened to Mr. Scar?
We've found her!
A little girl carrying a black and white cat!
Okay, let's move.
Mr. Scar! Sir Yoki!
Did you find the research documents?
Yes, we did!
Let's switch locations.
The soldiers from Briggs have already found this place.
Hurry.

This is fine.
We, the chosen ones, will be granted a body close to God's, and we'll rule this world.
Was his name Smith?
Nothing can be done about the advance unit.
So the weak should become victims for the chosen ones to survive?
That's right. Survival of the fittest.
The weak become the foundations of a nation, and the strong prosper above them.
So Ishbal was also...
That's right.
Ishbal was also a part of our plan.
Those weak people were destined to be destroyed.
I see.
Please leave that to me.
Yes, sir.
Sorry for the wait.
You certainly make a lot of phone calls, don't you?
Where is Lieutenant General Raven?
I have something to tell him.
You were on the verge of death, but you somehow managed to make a recovery on the same day.
What kind of magic spell did you use?
Don't worry about it.
And besides, you were jailed for killing officers. How did you manage to get out?
I told you, don't worry about it.
Since when has this plan been in motion?
I've heard it's been in motion since this country was created.
And it'll finally be complete during my generation.
I thank you for your cooperation, Major General Armstrong.
I'll negotiate with the higher-ups and prepare a seat for you.
No need.
What?
Was that Smith's left arm? Or his right?
W-What are you...
Aging is truly horrifying, isn't it, Lieutenant General Raven?
I'm sure you used to be a young, dignified soldier who loved this country from the bottom of his heart.
Y-You...
You have the chance to become a chosen one...
I promised you a seat...
There's no need for another seat.
I'll be taking the seat your rotten ass has been sitting on!
You useless geezer!!!
Immortality... is right in front of you...
You can lie there and literally become a foundation of this base, Lieutenant General Raven.
I wanted... to become immortal...
Buccaneer, contact Miles.
Yes, ma'am!
Everyone else, continue working as if nothing's happened!
General.
Thanks.
Smooth the concrete, got it?
Roger.
You're being very pushy.
Is it because I'm a State Alchemist who served in the Ishbalan War?
What can I do to satisfy you?
Do you want to know what kind of deaths your people experienced?
Shut up, Kimblee.
Don't you want to know?
I told you to shut up!
Do you have a moment, Major?
I have a message from Major General Armstrong.
She says, "Mission complete.You don't need to buy any more time."
Roger.
Good grief.
Finally, I'm relieved from talking with that freak.
Even though I was putting on an act, it was exhausting.
Kimblee.
Apparently, Lieutenant General Raven is missing.
Do you happen to know where he'd be?
Missing?
This isn't good.
The base isn't built safely enough for people to just walk around.
If something happens to the Lieutenant General-
That's good for me.
I received permission from the FÃ¼hrer President to act independently if something happened to Lt. General Raven.
Could you drive me down to the base of the mountain, Major Miles?
Do you understand?
My orders right now hold equal importance to those of the FÃ¼hrer President's.
Please wait, General!
Before you cover the hole completely, please send in a search squad for Smith and the unit...
The Fullmetal Alchemist created a secret passage in case a situation like this arose.
She killed him?!
Lieutenant General Raven?!
Well, that's all I needed to tell you.
Hey! Wait!
When the hell are you guys going to let us out?!
Who knows? Ask the Major General.
Dammit...
Getting impatient won't do us any good, Brother.
It's more important to rest for now...
I can't stay put when so many things are going on!
Hey, how's it going?
I've come to speak with the Fullmetal Alchemist-
Oh? It seems as though I'm not very popular here.
I've brought a guest today for you two.
A guest?
You idiot!!!
Why did you come here?!
"Why"?!
To switch your automail to the kind they use up here, of course!
Why are you guys in jail, anyway?!
No one called you out here!
What the heck is your problem?
I was so worried about you!
I wouldn't have known if the people from the military hadn't told me about it!
The military?!
Come on, you two.
The FÃ¼hrer President was very worried to hear of the situation.
Kimblee?
Yeah.
I heard from a friend who works as a nurse at the foot of Briggs.
He was hospitalized with serious injuries,
but his wounds were healed right after Lieutenant General Raven came to visit, and he was released right away.
Raven and Kimblee...
That's about all the information I have for today.
Thanks.
I'll ask for your help again when I need it.
Stop by at the shop again, okay?
You were dumped, eh?
Why don't you buy some flowers and chase after her?
I know when to give up.
I'll pass.
There are women who will dump you, but there are also women who are looking for a match.
I have a message fromMajor General Olivier Mira Armstrong,
Colonel Roy Mustang.
I'll be buying all of those flowers.
The chain binding them appears in unusual form.
Boy, unbind the chains and wrench them off.
Reel it in and expose the enemy.
Next time, Fullmetal Alchemist:
Episode 37, The First Homunculus.
Stratagems and blackmailing.
Those are the measures taken to fulfill one's desires.Scar, a man who only targets State Alchemists,
attacked Edward Elric.
Although Ed accepted death at Scar's hand,
his life was saved thanks to interference by Colonel Mustang and his men.
Ed and Al, who discovered the joy of being alive,
decided to return to their birthplace, Resembool, to restore their bodies.
Episode 6, The Road of Hope.
Yo.
Lt. Colonel Hughes.
The guys at Eastern Headquarters said that they were too busy to come.
So I'm here to see you off instead.
That's fine with me, but...
...why is the Major...
It's only natural you'd get an escort.
Getting attacked by Scar in your state wouldn't be too pretty, would it?
Just accept the Major's kindness.
Children don't need to be reserved.
Don't treat me like a kid!
And Al is going to be on this ride, too, right?
Of course.
I thought he'd be lonely riding alone.
What the hell do you take my brother for?!
Oh, it's time.
Well guys, take care.
If you ever happen to stop by Central again, come say hi.
Dr. Marcoh!
You're Dr. Marcoh, aren't you?!
It's me, Alex Louis Armstrong from Central!
Someone you know?
He's a talented alchemist who used to reside in Central.
He was studying how to apply alchemy to medical treatment,
but he had been reported missing after the civil war in Ishbal.
Let's get off here, Major.
I have a feeling he'd know something about the transmutation of living organisms.
Do you know someone who looks like this?
Wow, you're good at drawing.
Drawing portraits is a skill that has been passed down in the Armstrong household for generations.
This is Dr. Mauro, isn't it?
"Mauro"?
We were in a tight spot because our doctors were drafted for the civil war.
I don't know what would have happened if Dr. Mauro hadn't come.
He doesn't abandon a single patientno matter who it is. We owe him so much.
It's like something flashes before your eyes,and suddenly, your wounds are already healed.
This must be the place.
Hello?
Whoa!
Why did you come here?
Are you here to take me back?!
Please calm down, Doctor.
I don't want to go back there anymore.
Please, let me go!
No, you've got it all wrong! We just...
Then did you come here to seal my mouth?!
No, we...
You can't trick me!
I'm asking you to please calm down!
Al!!!
I had no idea you were hiding out in the countryside under an assumed name.
I heard a rumor you took some classified documents with you when you disappeared.
I couldn't stand it any longer.
Sure, it was an order from the superiors...
...but because of it, I had to stain my hands by conducting research on such a thing...
"Such a thing"?
So many innocent people died because of it in the civil war in Ishbal...
I can't atone for what I've done, even with my life.
So I decided to become a doctor for this town because I wanted to do all I could to pay for my sins.
Doctor, what exactly were you ordered to research?
The philosopher's stone.
The things I took with me arethe research data and the stone itself.
You have the stone?! Here?!
Isn't that a liquid, not a stone?
"The philosopher's stone"...
"The Heavenly Stone"...
"The Great Elixir"... "The Red Tincture"...
"The Fifth Element".
They aren't necessarily in the shape of a stone,just as how the stone itself has many different names.
But this is incomplete.
I don't know when it'll reach its limit and become unusable.
But it definitely displayed its power during the Ishbalan war.
Same with the bogus High Priest of Liore.
His abilities were improved,even though the stone was incomplete.
If something like that can be made,it's possible to perfect it if we give it more research!
Dr. Marcoh, please show me the research data!
Major... who is this boy?
He's a State Alchemist.
A boy like this...
There were so many alchemists who gave up their state qualifications after the civil war...
...because they couldn't stand being human weapons...
And yet, you...
I know it's stupid!
But I'm willing to go through hell until I achieve my goal!
I see... so you broke the taboo...
I'm amazed.
You were able to affix the soul of a human being.
You just might be able to create a perfect philosopher's stone.
Then...
I can't show you the data.
But!
You mustn't desire such a thing.
Even if it's to get our bodies back?!
You mustn't!
That is the Devil's research.
You'll see Hell if you study it.
I've seen Hell already!
Sorry. Please, leave...
I've seen Hell already!
Is it really okay?
It's incomplete, but we could have taken at least the stone by force.
Of course I wanted it. I wanted it so badly, but...
We don't want to steal the only support the people in this town have in order to get our bodies back.
It's good enough that we found outa philosopher's stone can be created.
We'll look for another way.
But what about you, though?
Don't you have to report Dr. Marcoh to Central?
The person I met today isa town doctor by the name of Mauro.
Hey!
Dr. Marcoh.
This is where the data is hidden.
If you still feel you won't regretdiscovering the truth, take a look.
You may be able to reachthe real truth that is beyond truth...
No... this is unnecessary.
I pray you boys will be able to get your bodies back.
What does it say, Brother?
National Central Library, 1st Branch.
Makes sense. A forest would bean ideal place to hide a tree, after all.
There are enough books in there to last several lifetimes.
I can find a clue to getting the stone here.
There you are, Marcoh.
Winry! Winry!
You've got an old customer at the door!
Yo, Granny.
We're back!
God, what happened to you two?
A lot. We're going to need your help again.
This is Major Armstrong.
Pleasure to meet you, I'm Pinako Rockbell.
But gosh darn, looks like Ed got shorter after not seeing him for some time.
Hey, I'm pretty sure you're supposed to say "got taller" at times like this...
If you really did, then I'd say so.
What did you say, you minimum hag?!
Didn't I tell you to give me a callbefore stopping by for maintenance?!
You trying to kill me, Winry?!
Welcome back!
Yeah.
My bad, my bad. It broke.
"Broke"?
An automail of the highest quality... That I worked so hard on...
Yeah, to smithereens.
And Al is broken, too?
What the heck have you guys been doing?
All you ever do is worry me!
I see.
So you want to return to Central as soon as possible to get that data, eh?
Yeah. So I want you to fix me up as quick as you can.
Looks like I'll need to adjust your leg,too, and not just your arm.
Oh my, seems like you've at least grown a bit.
Shut up!
Unlike your leg though, I'm going to have to remake your arm from scratch.
Will it take a week?
Don't underestimate me.
Three days.
You'll have to bear with a spare for now.
Okay.
It's tough to walk when you're not used to the leg.
I'll fix it up before you get used to it.
But seriously...
Materials... Assembly... Connection... Calibration...
It'll be all-nighters, no doubt.
Sorry for being so unreasonable.
But you want to go back to Central as soon as possible, right?
Then we'll work to make that happen!
But we'll charge extra for the express fee!
It's finished.
Thanks.
I don't see Edward Elric around.
Yeah, he said that he was visiting his mother's grave.
Major.
What kind of lives have those boys been living?
They don't even send us a single letter.
They are famous alchemists, even in Central.
That drags them into trouble, as well...
But don't worry. Those boys are strong.
Are they?
That makes me feel better, at least.
Are those two like grandchildren to you?
I've been watching over them ever since they were born.
Their father was an old drinking buddy of mine,
but he left the village, leaving his wife and children behind.
I don't even know if he's still alive.
Now that I think about it, where are Miss Winry's parents?
They died.
During the Ishbalan war.
My son... her parents... were surgeons.
They left for the battlefield because there was a shortage of doctors, but...
It was a horrible war.
It sure was.
Oh, shucks.
It's about time to start preparing supper.
You look like you'd eat a lot,so you can expect a big dinner.
Oh no, I can't trouble you any further...
A meal tastes better with more people at the table.
There's an extra bed open for patients, so you can sleep there.
This is the only place those brothers can stay, anyway.
Adding an extra guest won't make a difference.
What about their home?
It's gone.
They don't have a home to return to.
They burnt their house down the day Ed decided to leave this village after getting his state qualification.
They probably did it to make sure there would be no going back.
Let's go back.
They're all waiting for us.
We're ba-
Edward Elric!
Your innocent love that drove you to attempt to revive your mother!
Your tremendous love that drove you to affix your brother's soul while prepared to throw your own life away!

Accept my embrace!!!
Get away! It's too hot!
Stop it!!!
Wow, you guys are at it already! So early in the morning, too!
We've been working all night.
Wow, it's so late and you guys are still working!
You'll be done pretty soon at this rate, won't ya?!
Another all-nighter tonight.
Wha...
Out!
They said they'd get it done in three days, so wait patiently.
I know, but I just can't sit still when I know a secret to the philosopher's stone lies in Central!
Sorry for the wait! We're done!
You up for this?
Y-Yeah.
Ready...
Set...
Go!
This feeling of connecting my nerves gets me every time.
Well, I won't have to deal with this pain once I get the philosopher's stone!
That's too bad. You were a real money-spinner.
Yeah. There's no need to go through the trouble of getting your limbs back!
And besides, what's wrong with this?
The smell of oil, the groaning of bearings...
This beautiful form that was designed based on human engineering!
Ah, how amazing!
Automails, that is!
Machine freak.
Shut up, alchemy freak.
All right, it's complete!
How is it?
Yeah! Feels great!
We raised the ratio of chromium this time so it would be more resistant to rust.
But that makes it less durable, so don't overuse-
Hey, listen to me!
Al, sorry for the wait!
Will you be able to fix him quickly?
Yeah. There's a trick to it, though.
This seal right here acts as the mediator between Al's soul and this suit,
so I have to make sure I don't mess it up.
There! Perfect!
What do you say we test it out!
Sure!
It'll get quiet around here.
It's finally time!
We're going to go find Dr. Marcoh's data at Central!
We're leaving on the first train tomorrow!
He's sleeping with his belly out, again.
Seriously...
You're like his guardian, Al.
It's a pain having such a needy brother.
How old are you boys now?
I'm fourteen, and Brother is fifteen.
He's so short, the same age as me,and they call him a human weapon?
Look how defenseless he is right now.
Thanks a lot, you two.
What's this formality all of a sudden?
You've always welcomed us as family. I'm really thankful of you two.
He might not say it, but Brother feels the same way.
Al...
Hey, we know.
You don't need to say it.
Granny... Winry...
Thank you.
Thanks for everything, Granny.
Sure.
Huh? Where's Winry?
Her last few nights have all been all-nighters, so I bet she's exhausted.
Want me to go wake her up?
Nah, don't worry about it.
She'll just keep on ranting about maintenance and all that stuff.
Later.
Hey, you two.
Stop by for a meal every once in a while, will ya?
We will.
Coming to a place so deep in the mountains just for a meal?
Ed, Al.
Have a safe trip...
Yup!
I slept for the whole day.
Seriously... this place turns into a battlefield whenever he comes.
Oh.
Whoops?
Clues to the philosopher's stone are certainly there.
However, the enemy's evil hand has seized its target,
and the boys are drawn into a labyrinth by the real truth that is beyond the truth.
Next time, Fullmetal Alchemist:
Episode 7, The Hidden Truth.
If you wish to reach it, you must not avert your eyes.Calm down...
I want to talk to you...
Please, just listen to me...
And you too, talk to me...
Yes... that's right...
You're... not alone...
Golden hair...
He must have come from the west.
Well, we should at least bury him.
He's alive!
You're kidding me!
Get yourself together!
Hey, are you all right?!
Water! Bring him some water!
Don't drink it in one gulp. Take it slow.
Can you understand our language?
We're merchants from Xing.
Where were you headed?
I have nowhere to return to...
I also have nowhere to go...
I was afraid of staying in Xerxes, so I ran...
You're right...
I'm sorry...
I couldn't stop him...
I'm sorry...!
I'm sorry, Sergence...!
Episode 56, The Return of the FÃ¼hrer President.
Sergence was a master carpenter.
He often came to the palace for repairs.
Remember him?
And his son, Dozle, looked up to his father and worked hard in order to succeed him.
And Caiya, the florist girl.
She was kind and thoughtful.
Sari, the horse owner, really loved to drink.
We got along well.
Little boy Tommy's dream was to become a scholar.
Gidalush was a chef.
He once got fired for giving a free meal to a traveler with no money.
Andal, a fellow slave,
hated me for gaining the master's favor.
Zul was a hopeless villain and was only awaiting his execution,
but he apparently wants to get back at you before that.
Get back at me?
Those are the souls that just infiltrated your body.
They're cooperating with me for the sole purpose of defeating you.
You're saying that the philosopher's stone is working together with you, each one retaining its own will?
When they're nothing but an energy form?
Do you think it's impossible?
It almost drove me nuts to deal with these crazed souls one by one.
But I had plenty of time to talk to them.
Thanks to this immortal body you gave me.
You talked to them?
That's right.
And that's precisely what you didn't do.
I've already spoken to every single one of the 536329 people inside me.
D-Damn you...!
Go back to where you came from,
Dwarf in the Flask, Homunculus.
Sorry, but I'm going to be destroying your container.
Tearing apart your skin is the same thing as breaking your flask.
You'll turn into dust.
Experience the will of the ones you looked down on.
Aren't 
You can survive even after abandoning your skin?
Don't think for a moment that you fools are the only ones who progressed.
Didn't I tell you that I'll become a perfect being?
What?!
A frontal attack?!
Why must I enter my own castle through the back door?
Infantry, retreat!
Impossible!
Did we get him?!
Take over the steering!
Y-Yes sir!
Dammit!
Where are you?!
Damn you...
You took down a tank by yourself?!
Captain!
Captain Buccaneer!
What's the matter?
The master has returned.
Open the gate.
Open the gate, Falman.
I'm sorry, Colonel Mustang...
This may become my grave...
Hey, hey.
Stop trying to act cool with a lame face like that.
If it's about manliness, I can't lose to anyone either.
I can still fight!
Rubbish.
This is what people call 'recklessness'.
Exactly.
Letting your passions run wild and barking won't get you far at all.
But for some reason...
I can't bring myself to abandon people like that.
Dammit!
They've started to make a comeback now that the FÃ¼hrer President has returned!
If they get past this place, they'll take back the main gate!
Hold out no matter what!
Yes.
What?!
Are you serious?!
Madam Bradley!
The FÃ¼hrer President is fine!
He's alive!
I'm so glad...
Are you okay?
Yes, I'm fine.
I'm so glad...
He's alive...
Is he hurt?!
I don't have the details on that yet.
All I know is that he's wiping out the Briggs soldiers at Central Headquarters.
Should we blame it on Briggs?
But...!
It's to protect Colonel Mustang.
Yeah.
For starters, it's great news that the FÃ¼hrer President is safe.
Yes.
I just hope Selim is safe and sound as well...
If he's fighting against the Briggs soldiers,
it must mean that Major General Armstrong is the mastermind behind the coup d'etat.
Armstrong?
Oh...
The female general who came to Central a little while ago.
Now the real problem is, how much of the upper echelon is involved?
So he was alive...
We can't underestimate a homunculus, after all.
The fact that we pretended to be on the FÃ¼hrer President's side came back to haunt us.
We had to make Major General Armstrong out to be the villain...
This place is getting dangerous as well.
Yeah.
I wonder what's going to happen to us.
I don't know.
We've said that we're on the FÃ¼hrer President's side,
so I doubt they'll fire at us so easily.
But what if Bradley comes back into full control again?
We'll probably get crushed like ants.
Even if the madam is here?!
Do you honestly think they're that compassionate?
It's been a while.
You should have just run off somewhere after that.
Unfortunately, I'm as greedy as can be.
I want your life too, Wrath.
Reinforcements... I'm assuming?
Everyone in town was saying that you died in a train wreck.
How did you survive?
My eyes are too keen.
It only takes a moment to decide the route I need to take to escape through the rubble.
But I really am getting old.
My body can't handle things as well as it could back then.
He can do all this even if his body isn't at its peak?
Ling Yao... right?
Wow!
I haven't seen you since you let me stay in your beat-up apartment!
It's been a while, Warrant Officer Falman.
I'm a Second Lieutenant now!
I owe you for a night's lodging and a meal.
Let me lend you a hand.
He said that, but both of us are actually just doing this for ourselves!
Trying to get into my blind spot?
My partner inside me taught me how to fight you.
I see.
Then I'll do this.
He's starting to get pushed back.
Isn't this looking bad for him?
Fire! Fire!
Shoot!
Idiots! Don't interfere!
D-Damn you!!
Captain!
Seems like you have a sturdy set of abs.
Now you won't be able to use your sword.
Don't be reckless, moron!
But...!
Good job!
Christ...
I'm not too used to wielding these weapons.
Not bad, old man.
The FÃ¼hrer President has returned?
Yes, sir.
He's currently engaged in combat with an unidentified man.
We're going to gather more men, wipe out the small fries from Briggs,
and rescue the FÃ¼hrer President.
Replenish weapons and fill in vacancies.
Regain the main gate.
Yes, sir!
Go! Go! Go!
This is bad!
The Central Soldiers have gotten back up!
My bad!
I've already got my hands full with him!
I'm leaving the rest to you guys!
What?!
What are we supposed to do when they have so many more men than us?!
Figure something out!
"Figure something out"?
Captain! Hang in there!
We'll have to do just that...
Hey!
You all carry Captain Buccaneer somewhere safe!
Roger!
We're going to move that.
Roger!
Dammit! We're being held back by two machine guns?!
Since they have the high ground, we're at a disadvantage!
Can we get in contact with any of the squadrons in headquarters?
Have them open the gate from the inside.
Roger!
This is the 3rd Guards Battalion!
Central Headquarters Garrison, answer!
There are still dolls at the east gate...
What?
What are they saying?
Give me that.
I'm Gamelan from the Guards Battalion.
We're at the front gate.
Can you not open the gate to headquarters from the inside?
It's impossible!
There are dolls lurking about, so we can't open the gate!
Dolls?
What are you talking about?
What happened?!
What's going on?!
What?!
More enemies?!
What on earth is going on down there?
Oh?
Not bad, gramps.
Thanks. You saved me.
I didn't save you. I saved the young master's body.
If you say so.
Releasing a nasty aura from the young master's body...
Well, I couldn't have found you otherwise.
So, who's this guy who's left unscathed despite our combined efforts?
King Bradley.
Oh.
It's my first time seeing him with my own eyes.
So he's the one who ripped off my granddaughter's arm...!
When he learns about his enemy and himself, man will see the end of his war.
But he will not die for nothing.
Next time, Fullmetal Alchemist:
Episode 57, Eternal Rest.
He shall continue to observe from the afterlife.
Farewell, my lord.
Geez, you still haven't had a bite?
You're an important human sacrifice candidate.
We need you to stay healthy.
Are you listening, Doctor Marcoh?
I've been thinking for some time...
...as to what you mean by "human sacrifice"...
...and about what you are trying to make me do...
What you are trying to do right now...
...is to create a giant transmutation circle, using this country and its people.
And the purpose of that...
...is to create a philosopher's stone. Am I right?
You're close. On the right track, at least.
On the right track?
So, what are you going to do?
If you're not going to help us out, we'll destroy that village.
I heard from Lust.
You'll lend us a hand as long as we promise to leave that village alone, right?
What are you going to do?
Will you help us out and kill everyone in this country?
Or will you refuse and let everyone in that village die?
Such a fool.
By sacrificing something minor,you'd be able to save something major.
It's a simple concept if you just think about it.
Well, I guess that's what makes you guys human.
Emotion always gets in the way of logic.
It was the same way with that guy I killed.
When I transformed into his wife, he couldn't fight back and lost his chance to get me.
It's really helpful to us that you humans are so vulnerable.
Episode 24, Inside the Belly.
Seems to me you're really struggling against these humans,
Wrath.
To let Scar get away and even have Gluttony captured is unlike you.
Yes, you're right.
You look happy.
I won't deny that.
I'm having fun.
I've lived for sixty years, and now, I stand at the top of this country.
All according to Father's plan.
However...
Colonel Mustang, the Elric brothers,and the ones who come from a foreign land.
We, the wise ones, are being thrown into complete disarray.
It may just be it's almost time for the young ones to take over the generation, Pride.
Wrath, you've interacted with humans for far too long.
That may be true.
I want you to remember what exactly we are.
I won't report to Father that earlier statement, which could be interpreted as treachery.
More importantly, we need to rescue Gluttony.
There's no need to worry about that.
I have a vague idea of their location based on information I received from the military police.
What is this...
Colonel! Where are you?!
Stop! Lieutenant!
Colonel!
Lieutenant...
Don't provoke him!
He's only after me!
Mustang!!!
Lan Fan! We're getting out of here!
What... happened?
The monster was keeping another monster inside its belly!
It swallowed everything around him!
So even something like this is created...
...by alchemy...
There's no other choice. I'll have to kill him.
W-Wait, we were finally able to capture a homunculus!
Staying alive is more important.
Also, he knows our names and our appearances.
There's no reason to let him go alive!
He swallowed...
...the fire?
You really are useless, aren't you?!
Then why don't 
More like, stop following us! He's only after you, Colonel!
Run into the bushes! Spread out!
Dammit... talk about bad timing...
Hurry up, kid!
Hurry! There's no reason to stay here any longer!
But Ed and the others are still...
Not my problem!
I'm just a civilian.
Getting dragged into some ridiculous battle like this and dying doesn't sound too great to me!
Dammit!
What's taking them so long?!
Roy Mustang!!!
No!!!
Sounds like he fell for the dummy.
He doesn't seem too happy about it either.
Come on, hurry up and go home,
Mr. Useless.
Lieutenant, you're on this side.
Please take care of Lan Fan.
Are you telling me to shamelessly run away in this situation?!
You'll just get in the way!
Please, just leave!
You're really not helping at all, Colonel.
Seriously, this stupid Colonel...
Just do your own job.
The fact that the highest ranked man in this country is a homunculus isn't exactly a problem you can brush aside.
The highest ranked man...
You don't mean, FÃ¼hrer President Bradley?!
We can talk about this later.
Hop in!
Looks like there aren't any more empty seats.Just go ahead without us.
You idiot!
There's no way we can just abandon you kids on the battlefield!
Your opponent is the upper echelon of the army, right?
We have to beat some information out of that Gluttony guy.
We're going to stay here and fight him.
It doesn't matter that we're kids.
We're the ones who came up with this, anyway.
Thanks for lending us a hand up until now.
Edward.
Take this with you.
You know how to use it, right?
That's something used for killing people.
It's something to protect your lives with.
Your hands aren't meant for killing people. 
Please don't die. 
I'll be borrowing this.
Please, take care of Lan Fan.
Young master...
Young master!
Let's go.
Go!
Damn those brats!
Those are the types that end up dying early!
Mustang...
Where is Roy Mustang?!
How dare you kill Lust...
I won't forgive you!!!
I said we'd fight him, but he's kind of scary.
He's like a whole new person now...
How are we supposed to capture him?
What's wrong?
A dog?
Stop, Gluttony.
I-It talked?!
Hey, it's been a while.
Fullmetal runt.
Who are you calling a flea-sized runt?!
Calm down! I just came to pick up Gluttony!
I have no intentions of fighting mister runt--
Seventh time!
What are you talking about?!
Twice just now, and fives times back at Research Laboratory 5.
All told, you've called me a runt seven times!
Don't tell me you forgot!
You've got such a good memory...
Wait!
Giving me so much trouble...
I saw Mustang!
The one who killed Lust!
I'm going to swallow him! Swallow him all up!
You can't do that to the Colonel.
Not to the Elric brothers, either.
No!
I felt it earlier, but...
How many people do you have inside of you, homunculus?!
So you're the kid who crossed swords with Wrath.
What do you mean by "kid"?!
I'm the 12th Prince of the Xing Dynasty.
My name is...
You can swallow him, though.
Wait! Wait! Wait! Wait!
I see...
Looks like you can't do anything to us.
In that case...
Ling, we'll leave him to you!
Fine.
Show it to me, then.
Your skills that were enough to challenge Wrath.
Oh, really now?
He got the highest grade in his class.
On the essay he wrote about you.
Umm... do you mind if I read it here?
Not at the dinner table, dear.
Come on, what's wrong?
Let's hear it.
Okay!
My father is the FÃ¼hrer President of Amestris.
He works hard every day for this country.
He's always thinking about his people.
He's constantly trying to find solutions to problems so that everyone can live in peace.
But no matter how busy he is,he has never forgotten that he has a family.
He loves me and my mother.
My father always listens to me.
He always respects my wishes.
I love my father and everything about him.
Thank you, Selim.
Not bad.
Thank you for the compliment!
You fell for it!
What do you think?
It's something you humans can't do, isn't it?
Now... do you want to be strangled to death?
Or bitten to death...
Or cut to death?
Actually...
You're cheap, kicking dirt into my eyes...
There have been many assassination attempts on me, ever since I was little.
I've had to learn a few cheap tricks of my own.
What do you say? Can't you just give up and turn yourself in?
I just want information about immortality.
You don't want to get hurt, do you?
You little shit!
You're just a human! Don't be looking down on me!
Don't underestimate humans, homunculus!
Okay! Got him!
That was dangerous, geez...
Dammit, you...
I'm not allowed to eat you guys!
I want to eat that guy with the thin eyes!
Got him!
Hey now, don't be interfering with--
You're a human, after all.
Now, Gluttony!
Ling!
What?!
Dammit! I can't let him swallow human sacrifices!
Brother!
I swallowed them.
Brother! Ling!
Hey, spit him out! Spit out my brother!
I can't. I swallowed them.
No way...
You're fine, right, Brother?
I've got the rooms my wife and kids used to live in, but if I have too many lights on, the neighbors will get suspicious.
You're going to have to sleep in my bed.
I... I have to go to the young master...
Moron!
What can you do in that state?!
He still hasn't returned yet?
Got it.
Then I'll be on my way to Headquarters.
Yes. Thank you.
We're going.
Roger.
To where?
I need to find out who's on our side and who's not.
Geez, the whole lot of you...
You're still going to push yourself,even though your wound hasn't healed yet?
The FÃ¼hrer President might be a homunculus.
I can't just sit around.
Also...
We just left some kids on the battlefield.
I'll be setting a bad example asan adult if I don't take action now!
What's so funny?
Nothing.
I was just thinking about how mad Edward would be if he knew you were treating him like a child.
I was just repeating your words, you know.
But still, I'm amazed.
I would have never expected you to take such a bold step.
It isn't bold at all.
I'm just trying to clear the field.
Also...
Have a lot of people who understand and are willing to support you.
It's a little late, but I'm going to take his advice.
This could either be the gates of glory or an entrance to a den of evil...
You wait here, Lieutenant.
If something happens to me, I want you to get out of here.
I refuse.
This is an order.
I cannot comply.
You're quite the stubborn one...
You should know that by now.
Fine.
I'll definitely come back, so wait for me here.
Yes, sir! Good luck!
So you're Roy Mustang, eh?
I got a call from my wife earlier.
Lieutenant General Raven! I deeply apologize for not coming to introduce myself to you due to duties.
Also, I'm terribly sorry for visiting you at this hour!
I don't mind.
How's the old geezer Grumman doing these days?
He's doing fine.
Check.
I'm beat.
That's eleven losses in a row.
Make that twelve.
Well, I guess you put up a good fight this round.
You started to lose your touch right after you started to think you had a chance.
So you're saying I let up?
That's right. You're not able to become heartless.
Just like Raven.
General Raven...
From Central?
He's exceptional, but very soft-hearted.
There was a case where he ran in to rescue one of his men, who was injured, and ended up disrupting his formation.
If he's like that, he'll need a lot of men on his side.
W-What an insult!
I was employed at Central because of the way I treat my men!
A geezer out on the frontier has no right to say that about me!
M-My apologies...
Please don't let it get to you.
Also, seeing how you got angry at this,you must be a man of justice.
Lieutenant General Grumman told me I should go to you in times of trouble.
So that sly dog one-upped me again, huh...
Oh, it's almost time for the meeting.
I'll accompany you.
Have you gotten used to Central?
Not quite. I'm trying to bring myself to talk with the people more, but...
They've got rumors flying around all over the place, don't they?
But most of those rumors are nonsensical.
Something about Scar feeding a cat, immortal beings, and...
...something about the FÃ¼hrer President being a homunculus.
You don't have a great sense of humor, do you?
Did you really work under Grumman?
I guess I didn't pick that up from him.
Well, even gossip like that may end up entertaining everyone.
Huh? Am I really allowed to...
So, about that earlier joke...
About the FÃ¼hrer President being a homunculus...
I'd like you to continue.
What's the matter, Colonel Mustang?
What about me being a homunculus?
Is there a problem?
Oh, now I get it, Hughes...
When you said that the army was in danger...
...you didn't mean a crisis was approaching the army...
You meant that the army itself was in a crisis.
Fullmetal.
Looks like I've arrived at the depths of hell.
Where am I...
Blood?
What?
What is this place?
Al!
Hey, isn't anyone here?!
Where the hell am I?!
Do people search for the lost because they fear being alone?
But even if he can't see them, he won't give up.
Because he believes.
Next time, Fullmetal Alchemist:
Episode 25, The Door of Darkness.
Don't look at me.
Don't look at this figure.Ed and Al infiltrated the former Research Laboratory 5,seeking the secret of the philosopher's stones.
There, they encountered people who had their souls affixed to suits of armor.
Due to what Number 66 said during their battle, Al started to question whether he was a faux soul, created by Ed.
Episode 9, Artificial Feelings.
Looks like you're able to get up now.
What happened to Research Laboratory 5?
About that...
It was blown up by someone and has been completely destroyed...
Dammit!!! It's all gone?!
O-Oww...
D-Dammit...
I was so close to the "truth", too!
I can't be sitting in a hospital like this!
Mr. Fullmetal Alchemist!
We apologize for the rudeness in advance!
Huh?
Doing whatever you wanted...
If things had gone badly, you would have died!
Instead of trying to do everything by yourselves, rely on the people around you!
It wouldn't hurt to trust your elders, don't you think?
That is all!
Please forgive our rude language and violence toward a higher-ranking officer, sir!
N-No...
My fault.
Punishment... for the slap, sir?
No, I wouldn't dream of it!
Why do you guys try to be so considerate around me?
Because being a State Alchemist is equivalent to being a Major in the army.
I didn't get my state qualification for something like that.
You guys don't need to be so polite to me, either.
Oh, really?
Wow, all those times have been a waste, haven't they?
What a quick change!
Oh... now that I think about it, where's Al?
I scolded him with a fist earlier.
Ow...
I forgot about the other person who's going give me a scolding.
Hello? You've reached the Rockbells,specializing in prosthetics and orthotics.
Ed?
It's rare for you to call.
U-Umm...
This is extremely difficult for me to say, but...
Do you mind taking a trip to Central for a little maintenance?
Trip?
Well...
It's my right arm.
My fingers move, but I can't lift my arm at all.
So it was no good, after all.
Huh?
No, no, it's nothing.
Did you do something before your arm stopped moving?
I-I was in an all-out brawl.
AGAIN?! Quit using my automail for things like that!
H... Hello?
Miss Winry?
I guess there's no choice.
Where in Central?
Hey, you're kind of nice tod-
I mean... Nothing...
Okay. Gotcha.
Sorry for the trouble.
Yeah.
Thanks.
A love call to your girlfriend?
Who's my girlfriend?!
How boring.
When I was your age, I had...
Huh?
What are you doing over there?
Hey, Al!
Brother...
Want to head to our room?
Hm?
No, it's nothing.
I'll meet you there.
Okay.
Bye!
...maybe you're an armor doll that your "brother" created?
Oww, my rear...
I don't see how Ed and Al can ride these things all the time.
He said there'd be someone waiting for me at thewest gate, and I'd be able to spot him right away, but...
Oh.
Major Armstrong!
Ah, Miss Winry!
Where are those stupid Elric brothers?
To tell you the truth...
Ed's in the hospital?!
Th-That was fast.
You're planning on charging me a rush fee, aren't you?
But... you were injured this badly when your automail broke, because I...
...I didn't equip it properly, right?
I-It's not your fault or anything!
I'm the one who used it recklessly,and the maintenance was perfect, as always.
He didn't notice the missing screw?
And there's also the fact I didn't have to get hurt more because my arm broke!
So don't worry about it! Yeah? Yeah?
So it all works out?
Okay, so about this maintenance trip!
On second thought, I'll be charging a rush fee!
Huh?
You didn't drink your milk.
I... don't like milk.
And that's why you're so short!
Shut up!
I can't help that I don't like it!
You're being picky, Edward Elric!
All the kids drink it.
You won't get any girls if you can't drink milk.
Al?
Al's been acting strange lately.
What do you mean by strange?
Seems to me something's on his mind.
...maybe you're an armor doll that your "brother" created?
Just accept it. It'll make you feel better.
There! Maintenance complete!
Awesome!
It's finally fixed.
Thanks a lot.
You're welcome.
Yo, Ed!
So I heard you're kind of occupied after bringing a woman into your room.
She's just my automail mechanic!
Wow... so you sweet-talked your mechanic, huh...
When I say one thing, you come up with another!
I'm Maes Hughes.
Pleasure to meet you.
I'm Winry Rockbell.
Won't you get in trouble for ditching work?
No need to worry!
I left Sheska with overtime work.
What are you, a demon?
Oh yeah, you guys are almost free from your escorts.
Really?!
Escorts?
Hey, you...
Just what kind of dangerous situations are you getting yourself into?!
Well, look. How should I put it...
I-It's not a big deal.
That's right.
You two never tell me anything, anyway.
Well, I'll see you tomorrow.
I'm going to go look for a place to stay for the night.
What?!
Then stay at my place!
But...
Don't worry about it!
My wife and daughter will be delighted.
No, but...
All right, it's settled!
Huh?! Wait!
Come on, let's go!
Hang on!!!
Happy birthday Elicia!
U-Umm, Mr. Hughes? What exactly is...
Why, thank you for asking.
Today is Elicia's birthday, so to speak!
So to speak!
So how old are you now, Elicia?
Tw-
Three!
Sh...
She's...
So cute!
I've been with them ever since we were little, so they're kind of like my brothers.
You must always be worried about them with the way they are, aren't you?
You bet!
They came home after such a long time,and Ed's arm was in pieces.
And when they called me up, Ed's severely injured...
...and Al's being troubled by something...
But they'll never tell me what happened.
Even when they left Resembool...
They probably didn't feel the need to discuss it.
They probably thought that you'd understand, even if they didn't tell you.
But... there are some things in life that will only be understood through words.
I guess that's just the way things are.
Guys always convey things with actions, not words,
so if it's something tough, they don't want others to have to put up with it.
They don't want to worry people, either.
So they don't say it.
But even then, if those brothers happen to whine...
...you comfort them and set them straight.
I think that's perfect.
Elicia, let's play!
I'm getting off!
Here you go.
Hey! Elicia's going to be playing with me!
What? 
Your daughter sure is popular.
No!
She's mine!
Hey, you brats!
Do something to my daughter and see what happens!
You don't need to convey things with actions 
Are you sure?
You can stay here for as long as you're in Central, you know.
No, that would be too much trouble...
She's gotten so attached to you.
From this perspective, they almost look like sisters.
Winry!
Have a nice day!
Come home soon, okay?
Looks like it's decided.
It's like I have a little sister now!
So you came again, bastard.
You've got a living body...
...so you have to drink it.
I can't help that I don't like it!
I'm actually growing, despite how I look.
But everyone just calls me puny...
You've got it easy, Al.
Since you're so big already.
I didn't become like this because I wanted to!
M-My bad...
You're right.
It's my fault we became like this, after all.
That's why I want to get your body ba-
Is there really a guaranteeI'll be able to return to my old body?!
I'll make it come true.
Believe in me.
Believe?!
What am I supposed to believe with this empty body?!
Memories are just information if you really think about it!
It should be possible to create them artificially!
What are yo-
Brother, you once told me there was something you couldn't say to me because you were too afraid, right?
Could it be you were trying to say...
...that I'm just a fake... an artificial soul and a set of memories you created?!
Winry, you and Granny are both trying to deceive me, aren't you?
Am I right, Brother?!
Are those the thoughts you've been holding in?
Is that all you've got to say?
I see.
Ed...
Ed!
Al, you...
IDIOT!!!
W-What was that for?!
Winry?!
You moron!
You don't even know how Ed feels!
What Ed was afraid to ask you...
...is whether you hate him or not!
It's all... my fault...
He can't even eat, sleep, or feel pain anymore...
He... He hates me for sure...
Al wouldn't.
Why don't you just ask him?
I... I'm scared...
I'm too scared to ask...
And... And yet...
You...
Just who the heck would be prepared togive up his life just to create a fake brother?
Don't you two only have each other?
Go after him!
Y... Yeah.
MOVE!
Yes, ma'am!
Brot-
Now that I think about it, I've gotten a bit rusty because we haven't sparred in a while.
Huh?
Wha? Wa-
W-Wait a second, Brother!
Hold on!
Your wounds are going to open back up!
I win!
For the first time in my life, I beat you!
That wasn't fair, Brother.
Sh-Shut up!
A win's a win!
We've always fought a lot, haven't we.
Yeah.
Now that I think about it, we fought for the dumbest reasons, didn't we?
Like who gets to sleep in the top bunk.
Yep.
We fought over snacks, too, didn't we?
We also fought over toys.
I won.
Even when we played by Raine River...
You pushed me in, didn't you?
We fought all the time during our training, too, remember?
That was a draw since Master nearly beat us both to death for being "annoying".
We also fought over who would marry Winry.
I don't remember that!
I won. But she said no.
I-I see...
Are you going to tell me all that was a lie?
I'm sorry...
We want to return to our bodies, no matter what it takes.
Are you trying to say those feelings are artificial, too?
They're not.
That's right.
We decided to return to our bodies together, for sure.
We're going to be moving forward!
If we move forward, we'll get stronger, both physically and mentally.
What about milk?
I'll drink it!
...as much as possible.
Let's get stronger.
Yeah.
Mr. Hughes.
There are things that can only be conveyed through words. Don't you agree?
You're right.
Brother...
Master...
Where... did everyone...
Hi.
You're not an Ishbalan, are you?
Ah, pardon me.
I haven't introduced myself yet.
I'm a State Alchemist who is going to be in charge of destroying this area.
Oh, he's awake.
Where am I?
You're in the slums on the outskirts of East City.
Sir... you are...
I'm Ishbalan, just like yourself.
Don't worry, I won't sell you out or anything.
Are there other Ishbalan survivors in this place?
There sure are.
Even a soot-covered place like this feels like a city if you live here.
In other words, "All of this world is within the bosom of our God, Ishvala."
I... see...
Don't push yourself!
You were floating around in the sewers, covered in wounds.
Hey...
Is my right arm still attached?
Yeah, it is.
These tattoos are amazing.
Yeah.
It's a precious bond I received from my family...
Your best friend eventually becomes your comrade-in-arms, and finally, an everyday fixture in your life.

Next time, Fullmetal Alchemist:
Episode 10, Separate Ways.
A fixture in one's life. Something like that cannot be replaced.~ROMANJI~
blue scene
~ENG~
It's almost like a maze in here.
Try not to get lost.
Okay.
Oww...
Are you okay?
Sorry.
What's this?
D-Dynamite!
Seriously?!
They're all damp now.
Don't worry; they won't explode.
Come on; get a move on.
We don't know when the enemy will come after us.
Right.
Looks like the blizzard died down.
Get ready.
Aye, sir.
We're going to take down Kimblee and histwo men from Central when we see an opening.
Aye, sir.
Episode 41, Hell.
We're going to proceed with the mission with only the men currently present.
Don't tell anyone; not even soldiers from Northern Headquarters.
Hey-
Major Miles!
By "bring down", do you mean you're going to kill them?!
Of course.
I don't approve killing.
It's better to seal their abilities and beat information out of them.
Do you really think he'll tell the truth?
It's dangerous to keep him alive.
Then what about his men?
They may also be obeying him without choice after being turned into chimeras!
You have a point, but the keyword here is 
So you're going to kill them simply based on suspicion?
Same with Lieutenant General Raven! There were plenty of other methods-
Do not forget the law of Briggs.
If you let your guard down, you die.
Your softness may come back to kill you or one of your friends someday.
We don't need careless men in this land.
We're going to get rid of Kimblee and his two men.
I guess he's still a kid, after all.
Yeah.
Trying to settle matters without deaths in this world is a soft idea in itself.
But there was a time I was like that, as well.
I was, too.
You start to understand once you reach this age after living through many battles...
...that it's more difficult to keep someone alive rather than killing them.
The Elric Brothers chose the tougher path.
Strange guys, aren't they?
Yeah.
But I'm also a bit envious.
What's this "Rasayana" he writes about?
It's used to describe a miraculous medicine that extends one's lifespan.
I wonder if he's talking about a philosopher's stone?
Let's see...
What is this "Aurelian" that "turns all metal to gold,and transforms old men to adolescents"?
It's a word for gold.
Most of this talks about immortality and gold.
Could it be because Mr. Scar's brother was heavily influenced by Eastern Alchemy from Xing?
Meaning?
In my country, we refer to the immortal as a "True Being".
It literally means "Perfect Being",but because gold is a perfect metal,
there are times we refer toa "True Being" as a "Golden Being".
I see. So a perfect being is a golden being.
Some say we refer to them that way becausethe person who introduced alchemy to Xing...
...was an immortal man with golden hair and eyes.
Wow...
Golden hair and eyes? Sounds like Ed and Al!
Hey guys, come here!
I found the exit!
The sun's so bright!
Looks like we were able to get through the mountain.
The weather looks nice.
Let's head to Briggs now while we can.
Okay, everyone. Follow me-
Looks like the snow is pretty deep.
Help me!
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!
You can ride on my back, little girl.
Help me!
We'll make a path through the snow, so you can follow us.
You guys listening?!
Hey! Hey! Hey!
Help me!
We appreciate it.
Hey!
Hey! Help me!!!
Is someone there?!
Al?!
Sir Alphonse?!
Oh no, oh no, oh no!
Are you okay, Al?!
You saved me...
I got stuck in a deep spot and ended up getting buried by the snow.
But why are you here, Al?
I crossed the mountain to get here before you guys.
You crossed the mountain... in that blizzard?
I get it. Instead of making a detour here, you took a straight path.
But why make such a reckless trip?
I have urgent news.
"Urgent news"?
The Central Army has infiltrated Briggs.
Apparently, Major General Armstrong has been summoned to Central, as well.
So it's dangerous to go there now.
What should we do?
We can't go back, either.
You're going to have to find somewhere else to hide out.
Yeah, like where?
Follow me.
Where are we going?
There should be a village by the name of Asbec not too far from here.
I've heard rumors my fellow countrymen have taken refuge in the slums there.
An Ishbalan slum, huh?
Doesn't seem like we have much of a choice.
Master, you rock! Let's get going!
But is it going to be okay?
What is?
Won't Sir Kimblee get suspicious if you disappear all of a sudden?
Nothing to worry about. Brother will keep everything under control.
Three from the third squadron.
Five from the fourth squadron.
Looks like we're all here.
Now, I want you all to begin searching in the districts you've been assigned.
Yes, sir.
Roger.
Let's move.
Aye, sir.
Come on, Alphonse.
Isn't this where you say "Okay"?
But it's really hard to move in this, Edward.
That's where I need you to do your best.
Come on, Kimblee's watching.
Wait up, Brother!
Walk faster.
Hey. Where are Kimblee and company searching?
There's a huge mine shaft at the center of the town, right?
Apparently, they're going to enter that and search the mine.
He said he's only going to take the men he brought from Central because he doesn't trust the soldiers up here.
He must have noticed already.
We're going to stall them.
Secure a position for sniping near the shaft mine.
Roger.
Search the entrance to the mine.
If you find multiple footprints, there's no doubt.
Yes, sir.
Can you do it?
At this distance, yes.
What's wrong?
Edward is...
What?
Kimblee, shouldn't you leave it to the soldiers from Briggs to search the mines?
I heard it's a labyrinth down there.
Seeing as how you went through the effort to persuade me out of it, this must be the place.
What are you talking about?
I just want to capture Scar-
Or are you trying to buy time to position the sniper?
So you noticed?
There's so much thirst for blood in the atmosphere; it would be odd 
I didn't survive Ishbal for nothing.
It looks like they're talking about something. What should I do, sir?
Can you try to adjust your aim on Kimblee?
Yes.
Do it. Be very careful.
Aye, sir.
That bastard hid himself in snow!
Dammit!
Kimblee!
Damn you...
So you two are chimeras, too, huh?
Shit... I can't see a thing.
Well, they can't see me either...
...so I guess we're even-
Quit resisting, Fullmetal Alchemist!
There's no way for you to run since we can track you by scent!
Shut up!
Fullmetal!
What's going on?!
Where are you?! Respond!
Is that you, Major Miles?!
There are chimeras here!
And they've been trained to fight in places with low visibility!
Stay out of the smoke!
Oww...
Dammit... that just made me shorter...
Dynamite?
We're in a mine, all right!
Don't get too close now!
You do know what these are, right?
Are you stupid?
Those are probably too damp to use.
Do you two know what dynamite is made of?
Nitroglycerine?
Nitroglycol, chips of wood, and...
...ammonium nitrate, maybe?
Then what's ammonium nitrate made of?
Easy! Nitric acid and ammonia-
Ammonia?!
The smell!!!
What's that smell?!
Ammonia.
I guess there's a downside to having too keen a sense of smell.
These guys are toast.
So this is how you're going to act as soon as your hostages are released?
Don't know what you're talking about.
I'm just here to beat all the information you know out of you.
Christ, you're so hot-blooded.
Fighting with a young man like yourself duringmy convalescence would surely break my bones.
And I don't have time to play with you either.
I guess I'll be using this, then.
He just saved me the trouble of searching for it!
He's fast!
Too slow!
He lost his philosopher's stone,and his transmutation circle is no longer usable!
I-
"I win!"
Is that what you're thinking?
The determination not to kill.
An admirable policy.
But that's just asking for your enemy to take advantage of you during battle.
You should have killed me at that moment.
That softness is the cause of your defeat.
Did I fall down the mine shaft?
He's so heartless... he even got us into it...
Oww...
Dammit...
Where did Kimblee go...
You've got to be kidding me...
Hey!
Al! What's wrong?!
Sir Alphonse?!
Al?!
This isn't good.
I'm being drawn again...
What do you mean, "being drawn"?
Hey, what's wrong?
Al?
My soul...
...is being drawn toward...
Al!
Al?!
His soul is being drawn?
Sir Alphonse?!
Has this happened before?
Sir Alphonse! Pull yourself together!
I don't know!

Sir Alphonse!
Al?
Wake up, Al!
No...
Al!
Al!!!
What...
What should I do?!
Ed!
I can't... let her cry over something stupid like this...
Damn that Kimblee...
Yo, Fullmetal.
You alive?
Why did you save us?
You're hurt far worse than us.
Don't... get the wrong idea...
I... need someone to pull...
...this thing out... of my abdomen.
You're asking us to pull that steel frame out of you?
We're technically enemies, you know.
Yeah... please.
Well, we weren't ordered to kill you or anything.
Let's see.
But if we pull that out,you're going to bleed out in an instant.
As soon as it leaves my body... I'm going to seal the wound... before I bleed to death.
Are you experienced in medical alchemy at all?
I've attempted human transmutation in the past... so I studied the main points.
"The main points"? I'm pretty sure your organs are shredded to pieces...
If you don't have a philosopher's stone like Sir Kimblee does...
That's why I'm going to use my life instead of a philosopher's stone...
What?!
It may shorten my life span by a bit, though...
Is that okay?
I don't have the time to dawdle.
If this injury was caused by my softness... then I have to clean up after myself.
I don't really get it, but you don't have much time to waste.
I'm pulling it out.
Do it, please.
I need to think of my life as a form of energy...
The same as... a philosopher's stone!
That's right!
Right now, I'm nothing more thana philosopher's stone made out of one soul!
Think back, and try to remember that feeling!
That feeling...
...of using...
...life!!!
Is he dead?
Don't just write me off like that...
Oh, it worked?!
It's not completely healed.
It's just a temporary measure of linking the undamaged tissues... to stop the bleeding.
Then we need to get you to a doctor!
No, I don't have time... for that...
H-Hey!
I need to go after Kimblee...
...else... everyone will be in danger...
Geez...
Idiot.
There's no way he can win against him in this state.
What is it?
Whoa...
A philosopher's stone, huh?
The one Sir Kimblee had with him, right?
You don't need to refer to that freak as "Sir".
He dragged us into this.
You're right.
I guess that's the last time we see that bastard.
Yeah.
People will think we died here, so we're free.
And what should we do about him?
We can't just let him die.
He saved our lives.
Well said.
We need to find a doctor right awayonce we get out of here.
Yeah.






























After breaking the stalemate,unforeseen ideas and actions open new paths.
The one to find the hidden truth obtains the key to victory.
But that's all a part of the accumulating daily life.
Next time, Fullmetal Alchemist:
Episode 42, Sign of a Counterattack.
The beginning of war.Huh?
That's strange, I could have sworn it was this way...
No, was it that way?
Are you lost, Fullmetal?
Shut up!
We're lost because we came back to make sure that a certain incompetent moron wasn't doing anything dumb!
No one asked you to do it.
I'm surprised you can say that!
If Scar and I hadn't been there,
you definitely would have fallen from the right path!
Quit demanding my gratitude.
It's thanks to the Lieutenant that I was able to stop myself.
What did you say?!
They're so loud. We're going to be found by the enemy.
Scar, I'm going to go ahead and thank you while I still can.
For convincing the Colonel.
Although it would probably just anger you Ishbalans if you were to be thanked by someone like myself.
I think he was able...
...to return to his old self.
Thank you.
No need to thank me...
Episode 55, The Adults' Way of Life.
Okay, roger!
Understood!
Hey! You can stop firing now!
Cease fire!



Damn those traitors...!





So the reason why you were going all flashy with the tanks was to mask the noise of the tunnel digging!
That's right.
What was that?!
I couldn't hear!
What?!
Is this true?!
What's the matter?
Mission headquarters has fallen to the Briggs soldiers!
Brigadier General Clemin has been taken hostage!
Mission headquarters!
Is Buccaneer there?
Captain!
There are a great number of these one-eyed blue humanoid monsters.
It takes a lot to kill them, and they also eat humans!
No matter what happens, keep all the gates closed!
You mustn't let a single one of them out into the city!
Annihilate them within the headquarters grounds!
Aye, ma'am!
What the hell is Clemin doing?
From here on out, I'll take charge!
This will be the new mission headquarters!
The FÃ¼hrer President's chair...
If we overcome this crisis, it'll be mine!
Still more of them?!
M-Major General, what the hell 
An immortal army, apparently.
They're soldiers that don't fear death,
made by affixing human souls onto dolls.
You soldiers will someday be turned into those.
That thing's still going to move?!
How much does it take to kill it for good?
Then here I go again!
What tenacity...!
Oh no!
Major!
Major General Armstrong!
Don't come!
It's after us only!
Stay away!
So stubborn.
I'm going to kill the female general!
Pull!
Keep it up!
Please, you two! Run away while you can!
This way! Hurry!
Now, Major!
Are you asking me to run...?
Are you asking me to run from the battlefield again?!
There's no way I could!
I like that resolve not to run.
You're quite handsome.
Well, not nearly as handsome as my husband, though.
Who are you?
Ah, the female officer.
Which means you must be Major General Armstrong.
Your subordinate with the mohawk asked me to come help you guys.
That was unnecessary of him...
This is such a drag...
Here he comes, Dear!
Gotcha!
Who might that gentleman be?
My husband.
Courage increased by hundred-fold, muscles increased by thousand-fold!
Ouch...
He can still move?!
Am I... going to die?
Die...?
What does it mean... to die?
It's too much of a drag... to think.
Even living...
...is a drag...
Major!
Major!
All that's left are the skinny small fries!
Annihilate them with everything you've got!
Roger!
Sorry, I need to take a quick break.
Yes, ma'am!
Please leave the rest to us!
I don't know who you are,but I very much appreciate your help.
You're welcome.
I assume you must be a famous martial artist.
Me?
No, no, I'm a housewife and an alchemist.
You've heard of the Elric Brothers, right?
I'm like a relative of theirs.
So you're Izumi Curtis?
Yup.
Are the Elric Brothers also here?
Yes, they should be.
Well then, I guess we shouldtake care of the rest of the dolls.
Can you stand, Sister?
This is nothing.
Hey hey, rest up a bit! You're heavily wounded.
Us adults can't just lie around while the young ones are fighting.
We have to show the young ones, the ones who will carry this world from now on,
the way we adults, the ones who currently carry this world, live our lives.
Then I guess we'll help out too!
That'll be wonderful!
Having you two on our side is equivalent to gaining one hundred men.
Nah... don't expect too much out of us.
I'm apparently a "human sacrifice" or something,
so I'm going to be getting out of here after I fight for a bit.
Before I get captured by someone really dangerous.
You're being so sullen even though we're in the middle of a heartfelt reunion?
You've gotten really boring.
You used to be pretty fun, with all those emotions.
Lust, greed, sloth, gluttony, envy, wrath, and pride.
They say that man has seven sins.
Too much greed would certainly destroy one's self,
but on the other hand, all of those emotions are absolutely necessary to understand other humans.
Why did you let go of them?
Geez, that was dangerous.
Listen to what I have to say!
You're kidding me!
Cut it out, man.
I'm not too good at fighting.
Answer me!
Why did you create the homunculi, keep them by your side, and have them call you 'Father'?!
Back when you were in the flask,
you used to even make fun of the community known as a family!
Could it be that you actually wanted a family like other humans have?
Where did he go?
Don't tell me he's going to hide until the ationwide Transmutation Circle activates?
It's not that I want to become human.
I want to become a perfect being.
I'm going to be taking...
...the philosopher's stone that's inside of you.
Finally, your expression changed.
What did you do?
Something you didn't do.
You probably won't understand.
You threw away something important along with your emotions.
Something important?
Don't even think you'll be able to defeat us easily.
God dammit!
This won't do.
The tire is completely stuck.
Look what you did, mustache boy!
The solar eclipse will begin if we take our time like this!
Shut up!
Hurry up and pull the car out!
Oh boy...
Doctor Marcoh, please back away.
Mr. Heinkel and I can handle it.
No, but...
It'll be fine. Just leave it to us.
Okay, here we go!
One, two, three!
Go surrender to the mission headquarters.
Hurry up and go.
Yes, sir!
Thank you very much!
Well, thanks to the dolls getting rid of so many central soldiers,
gaining full control of the place is a piece of cake.
We're going to keep up this pace and gain control of the main gate.
Aye, sir!
Looks like there's not much for us to do...
You!
Damn you!
Why?!
Weren't you made to listen to our orders?!
Was that man lying to us?!
S-Stay away!
I wasn't meant to die here!
I don't know who you are, but good work.
Be my bodyguard.
If you do, I'll specially-
Mind telling us about "that man" whom you speak of?
This is gruesome.
Will you take command from here?
I don't understand how someone could sit in a place where they'd make such an easy target for a sniper.
Let's go.
Roger!
Sister.
Where does this passage lead to?
Seems like it goes down pretty deep.
Could it be the hole which the dolls came out of?
If so, it could lead underground.
Yes.
Okay, understood.
Madam!
Buccaneer and his men have captured the main gate.
There was little resistance, and they sustained only minor damage.
The entrance to the main gate has also been seized.
They've stationed the tanks there and are using it as a primary defensive position.
The Buccaneer squadron shall stay on stand-by.
Please be sure not to open the gate until every single one of the dolls have been exterminated.
Roger that.
This is the west gate.
We, the white squadron from Briggs, have taken control of the place.
This is the north gate.
Black squadron, taken control!
Blue squadron, taken control of the east gate.
Yellow squadron, we've seized their arsenal!
It's just as you hear, Major General Armstrong!
The Briggs Army has gained control of 90% of Central Headquarters.
Victory is ours.
We won!!
Looks like the Colonel didn't make it in time.
Hip hip, hooray!
Hip hip, hooray!
Hip hip, hooray!
Hip hip, hooray!
Hip hip, hooray!
Did you miss me?
Seems like you guys started a party while I was away.
From here on out, I myself will take command and annihilate the traitors.
I order all unengaged central soldiers to lend me a hand.
King... Bradley...?!
So he was alive.
Where?!
Where will he attack from?!
Salute the FÃ¼hrer President!
The king's sword brings about destruction, death,
waste, and despair.
He devastates all that stands in his way with unmatched power.
Next time, Fullmetal Alchemist:
Episode 56, The Return of the FÃ¼hrer President.
His home is the battlefield.Ed!
You little shit!
Ling!
You bastard!
Kill... me...
Save me...
Please... kill me!
Please...
I want to die...
Mommy!
What are you just staring out into space for, idiot?!
Why are you hesitating?!
There are...
There are people inside of him...
They want our help.
No! They're monsters!
But...
Pull yourself together!
They're monsters!
Kill me!
Mommy!
Please! Give me back my child!
Shut up! Stop it!
Dad!
It hurts...
Help me!
I said, "Stop it!"
Ed.
Let's play.
Let's play.
Playtime's over.
Damn...
...it...
Help me...
You don't understand the pain...
Ed! Wake up!
Come to your senses!
Join us!
Ed!
Ed!
Episode 26, Reunion.
Good! Good!
All right, bring it over this way!
Oh yeah.
I saw it over by the waste plant earlier.
If I recall, it was with some huge guy in an armor.
Armor?
Don't tell me it's the one from yesterday!
I'll never forgive him for kidnapping Shao May!
Demon! Devil! Loincloth!
There she is! Shao Ma-
Wait.
That fat one...
If I recall, they called him a homunculus.
Homunculus?
Their regeneration ability matches that of an immortal.
We can't jump in carelessly.
Immortal?
This is my chance! Let's go after him!
I told you. He's not an easy opponent.
Why are those two together?
What's wrong?
This place... is strange.
I've had a feeling that something was out of place, ever since I arrived in this country, but...
This is...
There are things crawling beneath my feet... and a lot of them...
What's wrong? Are you cold?
You okay?
This way.
I never would've thought something like this was under Central...
W-What the heck is this?!
That was done by the gatekeepers.
Gatekeepers?
They won't attack you if you're with me.
There's something up there.
Do we still have a long way to go?
A long way.
We're meeting your father, right?
He knows where people go after you swallow them, right?
Father knows everything.
Brother... You're alive, right?
Brother...
What's that?
A red... stone?
Right, Envy's core.
A philosopher's stone.
After all the time we spent looking for one,there's one right in front of me...
Let me out, Envy!
It stinks in here!
What?
We may be able to get out of here!
Let's work together, Envy!
What in the world are these?
They are chimera.
There's no end to them.
No...
As I thought... there's something beneath us...
Are they chimera?
No.
Is this... a person?!
Father made us all!
Me, Lust, and Envy!
It's loud up there.
Someone's coming...
I don't remember my parents' names, their faces, or even my own name.
No... I don't remember if I was abandoned or sold before I had even been given a name.
Which one of you will lead this country?
Will it be you?
We were called the "FÃ¼hrer President Candidates".
And we were all gathered into one place and educated in many different fields.
How to be a good emperor, anthropology...
We were trained in military combat, marksmanship, and swordsmanship until we were highly capable.
Don't sweat it.
He was just a pawn for you to achieve your goal.
"I will lead this country someday."
With that thought in mind,I endured the toughest of trainings.
He was no good either.
Next.
Lie down here.
Umm... What is this about?
Relax.
It'll be over soon.
What are you planning to do?! Those bodies are...
This is the twelfth one, huh?
Are you the one...
...who will receive my wrath?
A philosopher's stone is a high energy substance that includes the souls of many humans.
As it enters a human's body, it goes on a rampage and tries to take over.
The destruction and reconstruction by the stone is repeated until either the body dies or wins.
Eventually...
Amazing!
A new species of life!
Congratulations.
You've been selected to be the man who will lead this country.
He will prepare everything you may need.
From this day on, your name shall be...
King Bradley!
All that was left was a soul and the emotion of wrath.
I don't even know if this soul belongs to someone who was turned into the stone, or if it was mine to begin with.
If you were human, couldn't you live as a human instead of a homunculus, sir?
You're telling me to go back to being a human?
That's impossible.
This body has far surpassed human capabilities.
It's far superior.
Just as how you humans are proud to be human,we are proud to be homunculi.
I'm sure that woman took that pride to her death, as well.
Ow.
Just something temporary.
Thanks.
I've collected all the ones around here.
Are these all from Xerxes?
Yeah.
It's a portion of the mural that was in a temple in the ruins.
When I first saw it,
I thought it was a transmutation circle for a philosopher's stone, like the one beneath Research Laboratory 5.
But I was wrong.
The sun represents the soul.
The moon represents the mind.
And this stone which has the mural on it. This represents the body.
Come on... explain it so I can understand.
Basically, what was drawn there...
...is a circle for human transmutation.
Human transmutation?
So that means, to raise the dead...
No.
The principle of alchemy is equivalent exchange.
One cannot create a soul that doesn't exist in this world, at least through alchemy.
I've confirmed that.
So, I've thought of a way to get out of here.
What if I transmute myself from scratch...
A human that's alive?
Transmute from scratch?
Yeah.
I use this transmutation circle to decompose myself, then put myself back together.
That's also human transmutation.
The gate should open.
If Gluttony is a fake Gate of Truth,
shouldn't we be able to get tothe real world by going through the real gate?
I'll open the gate; you guys leap in.
What if this doesn't work?
Then we suffer from rebound.
All of the effects of the rebound go to the one who attempted it.
In this case, me.
I know nothing about alchemy.
I'll leave it to you.
All right.
So, Envy, there's something I need to ask you.
The mural I saw at Xerxes looked like this.
I'm curious about this symbol.
It's the word representing God, but flipped over.
And the dragon with two heads.
This represents the perfect being.
This means "I will cast God from the Heavens to the Earth, and become the perfect being."
People think of outrageous things.
It would be wonderful if they had only thought about it.
The problem here is...
...this part, which is broken off.
A lion that swallows the sun.
This represents the philosopher's stone.
And the ingredients of philosopher's stones are live humans.
Right, Envy?
Yeah, you're right.
Why did the nation of Xerxes,a nation so prosperous, perish overnight?
Where did its citizens go?
Isn't a portion of the ruins in here to cover up the evidence?
You guys turned all of Xerxes' citizens into a philosopher's stone, didn't you?!
Who did it?!
Who transmuted themselves?!
Who's the one who turned all of the country's people into a philosopher's stone for tremendous power...
...for the sole purpose of becoming a being that would surpass God?!
Is it the "Father" that you talked about?
Isn't that guy trying to recreate that event in this country by using you guys, the homunculi?!
I'll tell you if you get us out of here.
Let's stop beating around the bush, Fullmetal Alchemist.
You need a toll if you're going to open the gate, right?
Use it.
Help me!
Please, just kill me!
These are all people from Xerxes, aren't they?
Their bodies and minds have rotted away in the ancient past.
They are beings who are solely used as an energy source.
They don't even remember what they used to look like.
Are you sympathizing with them?
What a stupid emotion.

You hesitate to set fire to coal because you feel sorry for a tree that died ages ago?
They can't return to being human anymore.
Lay down the definition for a human with logic and not emotion, alchemist.
All right.
Ling, if something happens to me,tell everyone about what these guys are up to.
Whatever happens to Amestris isn't my problem.
Hey!
There are people precious to you waiting for you in that country, right?
Get out of here alive and tell them yourself.
I'm sorry. Please let me use your souls.
Let's do this!
I thought that pose of putting their hands together looked similar to something...
It's almost like a prayer to God.
It's been a while since I've done this.
I never thought I'd open it again... under this situation.
Ling! Jump in!
I'm counting on you, alchemist!
This is the same sensation I felt while being swallowed by Gluttony...
Thank you...
Thank you...
The body and the soul are connected by the mind.
A part of my body is before the Gate of Truth.
If I just let my mind guide me,I should be able to get to the gate...
Oh, so you didn't come here to get your body back?
Your father is through here, right?
Yeah.
I can find clues on how to find my brother...
All right, I'm here.
Why are there two gates?
Al!
Al! Come here!
Hurry up! Al!!!
Al!!!
I can't.
You're not my soul.
I can't go with you.
Alphonse!
Alphonse!
Alphonse!
Someday, I'll come and bring you back.
Wait for me.
Wait for me!!!


Next time, Fullmetal Alchemist:
Episode 27, Banquet at the Crevice.
You mustn't be afraid of the darkness inside of you.





























Could you tell me what roomColonel Roy Mustang is staying in?
Let's see...
May I have your name, please?
The name's Nox. Doctor in private practice.
He'll know right away.
Finale, The End of a Journey.
Hey, princess.
It's been a while.
Who might that be?
I need him here for a reason.
He's what I'd call my trump card.
So, is he down in the dumps?
The main method of cultivation in the Ishbal area is double-cropping,
Bzzzt, try again.
They raise the same crop semiannually.
You expect to gain their trust like this?
I know!
Moving on.
So what crop do they raise with that method?
Barley and cotton.
Correct.
So you DO know your stuff.
Don't underestimate me.
I've been doing some research for a while.
He's planning to solve the Ishbalan crisis before becoming the FÃ¼hrer President.
"Solving"?
But first things first, "becoming the FÃ¼hrer President"?
Is that you, Dr. Nox?
Yo.
Looks like... you're doing okay.
Yeah.
These guys won't leave me alone.
No breaks, no nothing.
Not exactly what I meant.
Aren't your eyes...
Yeah.
Apparently, it's the punishment Truth gave to someone who dreamt of the future.
Are you okay?
Not sure about that.
Either way, I can't stop here.
FÃ¼hrer President...
Well, to take care of Ishbal first.
The Ishbal Annihilation...
That was what started everything.
Yup. Both for you, and for me.
I'm going to set things right.
Meaning?
First, I'm going to open up the areas in Ishbal that are currently off-limits.
Then, I'm going to allow the Ishbalans living in each slums back to their Holy Land.
There's much more to be done.
We were able to overcome the crisisthanks to Scar and the other people of Ishbal.
We're in their debt, after all.
Colonel, I brought the data you asked for.
It's not as if our sins will be forgiven,but we want to start with what we can.
Christ, you lot...
Yo, it looks like they took the words out of our mouths, Dr. Marcoh.
Marcoh?
Dr. Marcoh?!
Colonel Mustang.
I've got a philosopher's stone right here.
We should be able to get your vision back with this.
You're right.
I made this stone in the past by using the lives of Ishbalans.
I have no right to say this, but if it's for the sake of reviving Ishbal, I'm sure they'll...
No, I cannot hear their voices.
So this is a request from myself.
I want to patch you up with this stone for the sake of Ishbal.
They might get angry.
Fullmetal, too.
But I'll gladly take your offer.
And with that, I'll give it my all.
But before that...
...there's someone who needs the power of the stone more than I.
I can come after him.
Havoc General Store, happily serving for 80 years now!
Oh, Breda. What's up?
What?! You want me to head down to Central NOW?!
What do you mean, "you'll find out when you get there"?
How are your wounds treating you, Scar?
Why did you save me?
Initially to find out more about Eastern Alchemy,
but the situation has changed.
Mustang wants Miles for his new Ishbal policy.
And so, I decided to take you along.
Not as "Scar," but as someone of the Ishbalan race.
What do you say?
Won't you help us in reviving the Ishbalan religion?
We cannot let a religion and a culture so rich in history die out.
The death of a culture equates to the death of its people.
Save the people from death with your hands.
The meaning of being kept alive...
So you want me to live for a bit longer to find what that is, huh, Brother?
Fine.
I'll help you out.
Take me wherever you please.
Okay, Miles. I'm leaving the rest to you.
Do things safely.
Roger.
That Mustang...
He'd probably be frightened to deathif he were to find out that Scar is alive.
Scar.
What is your true name?
I've died twice.
I don't exist in this world.
Thus, I don't need a name.
Call me whatever you please.
I see.
We'll meet again, Ishbalan.
You okay?
I didn't imagine that my muscles would be this weak.
Want a ride on my back?
Nah.
I want to walk with my own two legs.
I'll take it slow, so you go on ahead.
Nah. We left the house together.
We have to go back together, too.
Well then, let's go.
Yeah.
Brother, your leg...
Yeah... I haven't had maintenance on it in forever.
Thanks.
For what?
Nothing.
What the heck?
Weirdo.
Oh yeah, I wonder if Ling and the others have arrived in Xing already.
It's been two months since then, so I'm sure they have.
I hope May is okay...
Don't worry.
Just leave everything to him.
May...
Sir Al...
What's the matter?
Nothing.
Hey you, the princess from the Chan clan.
Ling Yao!
Whoa, don't give me that scary look.
You're such a klutz.
In the end, you were unable to obtain a philosopher's stone because you were meddling in another country's affairs.
The Yao clan will now be in control.
But don't fret.
Our clan will protect yours.
I'm the man who even accepted the homunculus Greed.
I'll accept the Chan clan along with all of the other clans.
Just look at you.
Don't worry. People from Xing always keep promises, right?
You'll "accept us all"? That's so greedy, Ling Yao!
Shoot, maybe he rubbed off on me.
Well, then... guess we should start heading back.
Already?
Yeah.
I want to give Fu a proper burial.
Later.
Yup, later.
So many things happened...
Yeah.
By the way, Alphonse.
Seems like the princess of Xing,May Chan, really took a liking to you.
Yeah, she's such a nice girl.
Moving right along, what about things between you and Winry?
Den! It's me!
Customers...?
Den, that tickles!
Welcome home, idiots!
Yo!
Good to be home!
Oww!!

I suck at stuff like this...
Nothing, huh...
Ah, well.
Brother, you still haven't fixed it yet?
I'm all worn out from greeting people.
Winry knows that, but she's treating me like her slave.
On top of that-
She wants you to come down for teanow that her apple pie is out of the oven.
Okay.
We have a pretty amazing view today!
Yeah.
The world is so vast.
Yup.
Brother, there's something that's been on my mind for a while.
I'm probably thinking of the same thing.
How is your work?
There are so many things to worry about; I feel like I suddenly aged twenty years.
But I have Mustang and Armstrong fulfilling their duties in the east and the north, respectively.
Thanks to them, an old geezer like me can somehow manage to perform my duties as the FÃ¼hrer President.
I really owe them a lot.
Are you not going to give away your position?
I can't hand it over to the young ones just yet.
Oh, my.
You sound just like my late husband.
He was always totally committed to work, like you are.
Oh no, I'm the most...
...irresponsible person I know.
Oh my, Selim.
What's the matter?
This little birdy is hurt.
Could you help him?
Oh, no.
Have the butler call a veterinarian.
Will... Will he get better?
Of course he will.
Run along now.
He's grown into such a kind boy.
He has.
Everyone protested when I decided I'd raise him,
but he's grown so much without giving me reason to worry.
We're going to be keeping an eye on him for just a little while longer.
You're aware what we'll have to do...
...if he causes trouble, right?
I won't let him.
A homunculus and a human.
Will they really be able to understand each other?
New possibilities get you excited no matter how old you are.
Is Edward not depressed about his left leg?
Not at all.
He even said, "As punishment, I'd rather keep my leg as an automail."
I see.
He also said, "Winry'll cry if I don't have this."
What in the world?
I'm so glad you two got your bodies back.
I'm sure Maes will be happy too.
Starting with Mr. Hughes,
so many different people from so many different places helped us be happy.
And that's why I feel like it's our turn to give back.
Is that what you alchemists call "Equivalent Exchange"?
Nope. If we received 10 and gave 10 back,everything would be the same.
If we receive 10, we add an extra and give back 11.
It's very minor, but it's a new rule my brother and I came up with.
But now we're going to have to live up to our word.
There's something you want to do, isn't there?
There's a girl we couldn't save.
We still can't forget about her.
Welcome!
Mr. Jerso, Mr. Zampano.
Yo.
We've got a ton of food. Eat up.
Okay.
Excuse me! Can I get a glass of milk and a sandwich?
Coming right up!
I see. So you've already paid your respects.
Yup.
Then it's...
...time.
I'm going to Xing.
I plan on studying Eastern Alchemy full-scale at May's place.
Not just Xing.
I want to go around all the eastern countries to study various things.
I want to see and learn many things.
I also want to meet many new people.
But wait, are you two really coming along?
Of course!
Our wild instincts tell us...
...that coming along with you...
...will get us something great!!
Alphonse.
We're going to look for a way to return to our old bodies.
You're the one who told us not to give up.
We have to do things ourselvesinstead of having others do the work.
Right!
Isn't your brother coming to Xing?
Nah.
I'm taking the eastern route,and he's taking the western route.
And once the two of us gather the knowledge we gained from both directions,
we may be able to avoid the same kind of tragedy that happened to Nina.
But, you know...
That's not the only reason why we're traveling.
We want to see just how vast the world is!
You need to oil it every day.
Sure.
And check to make sure all the screws are tight.
Sure.
Dry it off after coming out of the shower.
Sure...
Hey, are you even listening?!
Sure...
Geez...
Well, here it is!
With this attitude, you're just going to end upbreaking it and having to come back again soon.
Yeah, yeah, I know.
When you need maintenance,be sure to call in for an appointment.
Sure.
Appointment...
What?
Winry...
What is it? Just speak up if you've got something to say.
It's equivalent exchange!
I'll give you half of my life, so you give me half of yours!
Oh, geez!
Why do alchemists have to be like this?
"Equivalent Exchange"? Are you retarded?
What did you say?!
You really are stupid.
Half? I'll give you all of it.
W-Wait, maybe not all of it!
90 percent...
Or maybe.. 80 percent?
A bit more than 70...
Okay then, 85 percent?
Sure! I can give you that much!
W-What?!
Ed!
My bad, my bad.
Ed!!
You really are amazing.
You're able to overturn the law of equivalent exchange so easily.
What do you mean by that?
Are you making fun of me?
I'm not.
That cheered me up. Thanks.
I'll be off now.
Safe trip!
Oh my, even Edward left on a trip?
Why don't they settle down a little?
For them, this is fine.
Men who keep still are no fun.
A lesson without pain is meaningless.
That's because no one can gain without sacrificing something.
But by enduring that pain and overcoming it...
...he shall obtain a powerful, unmatched heart.
A fullmetal heart.






































Scar appears in Central once again.
In order to lure out the homunculi, Ed and Al work with Ling in order to purposely attract Scar's attention.
The plan works, and Gluttony and Wrath make their appearances.
However...
Lan Fan!!!
You deflected the slash with your kunai, eh?
Can I eat her?
Make it quick.
Lan Fan! Pull yourself together!
You think you can escape my eye?
Seems you're quite experienced.
He's constantly trying to bring his attack toward my left side, my blind side.
Gluttony!
Roger!
Now, no one can see us here.
I've got a lot to ask you.
Just what are you folks?
How can you tell what's inside Gluttony?
You're still trying to escape in this situation?
If you throw that extra baggage away,I bet you'll be able to save your own tail.
Baggage, you say?
You're the highest ranking man in this country, right?
If I remember correctly, your name is FÃ¼hrer President King Bradley.
The king exists for his people.
Without his people, there is no king.
King Bradley, you'll never be able to become a true king!
You're far too inexperienced.
There is no such thing as a true king!
You rely on your eye too much!
From the draft, the exit should be...
What's wrong?
I still have this eye, you know!
Episode 22, The Distant Backside.
Winry.
We'll be back soon.
So be good now, you hear?
Winry.
We're here.
Maybe I was thinking of Mr. Hughes as my dad...
Come see him every now and then, okay?
He always hated being alone.
Miss Gracia...
I heard the Elric Brothers are fighting!
What? Again?!
Military police are running all over the place!
What are they fighting over 
Geez...
Apparently, they're fighting against that guy who only goes after State Alchemists.
They still haven't caught him yet?
What the heck is the army doing?
No... What am I thinking?
A dead end!
Dammit!
Nice, my little brother!
Shut up and run!
Have we been given permission to engage yet?!
Not yet, sir!
Dammit! What's going on?!
We haven't gotten the signal from Ling yet.
Brother is starting to get tired, too.
I should buy some time.
Scar! You use alchemy, too.
Why are you so against alchemistswith the mindset they oppose God?!
I told you in East City.
There are ones like you, who create, and ones like me, who destroy.
You...
You just want to justify murder by using God's name!
Didn't you kill Shou Tucker and Nina by acting as God's hand?!
I see. So you guys saw that chimera, too.
Techniques that give birth to such tragedy...
Is that the alchemy you fools so worship?!
You turned your brother into that form...
...with your own hands.
Techniques that bring about the creation of matter...
Isn't that the vanity which gave birth to that chimera?!
Even so...
Why did you have to kill her?!
Why did you take her life?!
I'm sure you fools understood it, too.
That chimera would never have been able to return to her original state.
If I had let her be, she would have receivedthe same treatment as other experimental animals,
and she would never have been treated as a human again.
That's right. Back then, we knew in our heartsthere was a possibility Nina would be experimented upon.
We were just postponing a problem we didn't know how to solve.
We didn't do anything...
Nothing...
As you say, we, alchemists, have done wrong.
But still, we can't approve of what you're doing either!
Do you recognize...
...the name of an Amestrian doctor, Rockbell?

Wait, Brother!
Do you remember the couple who saved you,which you killed shortly after?!
Brother!
What do you mean?
Winry...
This man...
...killed Dad... and Mom?
No way...
They were killed... by one of their patients?
Why?
What did Dad and Mom do?
They didn't do anything to deserve to die... did they?
Give them back...
Give back Dad and Mom!!!
Wait, Winry.
Don't...
You can't do that!
Winry!
Please, stop!
I understand your resentment. 
But all revenge does is give birth to more revenge. 
You must persevere. 
You're those doctors' daughter, huh?
You have every right to shoot me.
Brother!
Brother!
Brother! The army is already nearby!
Forget about your research and-
Hang on. I'm almost done.
What is that tattoo?
Oh, this?
The basics of alchemy are understanding, decomposing, and reconstructing.
My right arm is for decomposing,and my left arm is for reconstructing.
I researched Eastern Alchemy and arranged it myself.
What I realized from that...
...is that this country's alchemy is a bit strange.
Who cares?!
More importantly, the army's-
Hey.
Why are you stopping me?!
We need to get out of here immediately!
Please, restrain yourself.
Your brother's research may save Ishbal.
What?
Did you hear about the State Alchemists?
They're using their horrifying powers asweapons of war and are laying waste to Ishbal.
Even though we're citizens of Amestris, too...
I know that, but...
What does that have anything to do with my brother?
Your brother may discover a way to gain power enough to face those State Alchemists...
...and perhaps even enough to destroy their army!
With power that far surpasses theirs...
To retaliate against them with alchemy!
Make them pay for their sins with blood!
Look, Brother.
This is the alchemy that you've been devoting yourself to.
Even if you wish for your efforts to benefit the people and for happiness...
No one views it the same way!
So this is alchemy...
You think something like this will save Ishbal?
Something like this, which creates an endless cycle of destruction and slaughter?!
Oh no!
Father! Mother!
You were safe!
Yes, we're fine.
It's a good thing we were out getting ready to escape.
I made it in time!
I was compiling all my critical papers, so I was a bit late.
Critical papers?
You hold on to this.
What is this?
My research.
This was all I could bring.
Take it and run.
Hang on-
If something were to happen to me,all my research would go to waste.
Why don't you hold on to it yourself and run?!
You're a powerful monk and have gone through rigorous training.
You have a better chance of surviving than I do.
Look.
My legs won't stop trembling.
I'm a pathetic older brother.
Brother...
A soldier?!
Transmutation circles?!
A State Alchemist!
Get down!
Hang in there...
Don't die!
D-Dammit... It won't stop bleeding...
His arm...
Where is his arm...
Dad...
Mom...
Everyone... Someone...
Live...
You can't die.
I'll show them the honor of an Ishbalan!
If you really feel that way, then run!
That's right! I didn't treat you to let you die!
You, too, Doctor! You have to flee with your wife...
You're a patient! Don't be worrying about us!
Brother...
Get down!
No way...
He... shielded me?
Brother...
If you have the strength to escape, do so!
He woke up!
Don't move! Your wounds will re-open!
Dear, come!
Dear!
You have to rest!
Someone! Get that cart!
Please, take him with you!
Brother, is that you?
Thank goodness... Brother was safe-
What the hell is this?!
Sedatives!
We're out! We used them up on that other boy!
State Alchemists...
Amestrians...
I won't forgive them...
You... You guys...
Dr. Rockbell!
Shoot me.
Don't shoot, Winry!
Put the gun down!
You shouldn't hold something like that!
Winry!
Shoot me.
But if you do, I'll take you for an enemy that very instant.
Scar!!!
If you lay a finger on Winry, I'll-
Kill me?
That's fine, too.
The chain of hatred will not end unless one of us dies.
But don't forget this!
The ones who first pulled the trigger in that civil war were you...
...the Amestrians!
No! Don't shoot!
Put the gun down and leave this place!
Winry!
If you can't shoot, then get out of here.
You're in the way!
Don't shoot!
Get down!
Brother...
You stupid brother! What are you doing?!
Are you trying to get both of you killed?!
Hurry and get Winry to a safe place!
Winry, let go of the gun.
I couldn't shoot...
Please don't shoot. I'm begging you.
But... he killed Dad and Mom!
He tried to kill you and Al, too...
But why?!
You helped a woman give birth inRush Valley, and saved her and her baby.
You gave me an arm and leg so I could stand again.
Your hands aren't meant for killing people.
They're for helping them live.
So...
Must one throw something away to protect someone?
And those not prepared to do so will lose both and fall?
No.

Next time, Fullmetal Alchemist:
Episode 23, The Girl on the Battlefield.
I won't show tears of sadness...
...because I promised not to.





























Colonel...
There's no need... for you to perform human transmutation.
You'll do it, won't you, Mustang?
Now!
I will.
Oh, so you'll do it?!
I'll do as you say, Lieutenant.
I will not perform human transmutation!
You're going to abandon her? That's not very nice of you.
Abandon?
That's the last word I want to hear from someone who uses these guys as pawns.
I'm sure they're happy to be my pawns.
They were abandoned by their parents and would have died long ago if it hadn't been for me.
Yet, I gave them food and the highest education possible.
I also gave them the meaning to live.
They're thankful.
And this is precisely why you get tripped up by your enemy.
What are you-
He disappeared?
Episode 59, Lost Light.
Well, 
I was able to capture you thanks to your stupidity.
L-Let go!
Hurry up and let everyone go!
Or else...!
I-I'm the only doctor here who can use alchemy!
If you kill me, that woman is as good as dead!
Don't you get it?!
You're sounding pretty darn lame right now, Mister 
A philosopher's stone...
Get the fuck out of my way!
Lieutenant!
Hang in there!
Lieutenant! Open your eyes!
Lieutenant...
Lieutenant...!
Lieutenant!
You all right?!
If I can just reach that...
Don't die!
Get yourself together, Lieutenant!
This is more important!
Leave this to me.
Lieutenant!
I've stopped the bleeding.
You need to let her see a doctor right away.
I'm in your debt. Thank you.
I'm sorry, Colonel...
Don't speak. Just rest for now.
Thanks for understanding my glance.
We've known each other for a while, after all.
Furthermore, you were glaring at me as if you were trying to say,
"I'll shoot you to death if you perform human transmutation."
That was the last of them, eh?
Thanks, guys.
You saved us.
Don't worry about it, man.
Right! The philosopher's stone!
King Bradley.
His wounds aren't healing...?
Long time no see, Mustang.
It certainly has been a while.
You look awfully different from how I remember.
Bradley, eat this!
I was certain you'd attempt human transmutation...
if someone precious were to fall right in front of your eyes.
You're right, I probably would have back then.
But now, I have people by my side who are willing to stop me and point me toward the right path.
When you start thinking that humans are pitiful creatures that never learn,
there are those like you who knock us off our feet by learning and evolving at such a quick pace.
Humans are just...
...so unpredictable, it infuriates me.
What's the matter?
He's right underneath...
Deep below.
Damn you!
I won't allow you to get in his way!
Give it up, old man.
You're already-
Jerso!
Pull yourself together!
G-Get yourselves out of here...!
Shit.
Something truly fearsome is approaching.
Look after the lieutenant for me.
Colonel!
A-Attaboy, Bradley.
I sure am skilled at raising-
Colonel Mustang, you're the fifth sacrifice.
The fifth and last.
Again?
Why the heck is it so rowdy today?
Ah, the solar eclipse has begun.
I didn't really want to have to use this method,
but we're fairly short on time right now.
We're going to force you to open the gate, Colonel Mustang.
I certainly won't perform-
It doesn't matter whether you're willing to or not.
An alchemist possessing the knowledge of human transmutation was assimilated by Pride.
He has the construction formula.
I've secured him.
Step aside, Wrath.
Well, I'm curious as to what they're going to take from you.
Colonel!
No! You'll be dragged into it!
Colonel!!
The transmutation is complete.
That's the four-eyed geezer?
Where is the Colonel?
Worry not.
He should be with our father by now.
Though I certainly can't guarantee that he is with no physical defects.
As you can see, I'm fatally wounded.
Who shall be the one to win fame for defeating the FÃ¼hrer President of Amestris?
Will it be a chimera?
A foreigner?
Mustang's pet?
Or perhaps, will all of you band together to take me down?
What the hell...?
Why do I get the feeling we won't stand a chance against one wounded old man?
Underneath...
Right beneath that hole.
The four-eyed geezer went nuts as soon as May said there's someone underneath that place.
Said something about not letting us get in his way.
Seems like they don't want us going further underground.
So that must be the center.
That's right.
I feel a huge cluster of energy right below us.
If that's the case...
Colonel!
He's the fifth sacrifice, father.
I'd like to say that we've gathered all five,
Are you all right, Colonel?!
Colonel!
Get yourself together, Colonel!
but Alphonse Elric has yet to come over to this side.
Are you okay, Colonel?!
Fullmetal...?
Where the hell are we?
We're with the big cheese now.
What in the world happened, Colonel?
I was thrown in front of a large gate in some white room...
Gate?!
Don't tell me they took something from you?!
But you still have all your limbs...
I'm surprised you can see me when it's so pitch-dark out here, Fullmetal.
What are you talking-
It's too dark for me to see anything.
The light.
Where's the light?
I-It couldn't be...
So you've lost your vision.
How convenient.
Truth be told, you have the most troublesome ability out of all the State Alchemists,
so I'd much rather you sit there and weep.
Colonel...
You performed human transmutation...?
Fullmetal.
Do you really think I'd do something like that?
We forcefully had him open the gate.
But the result is all that matters.
Though Colonel Mustang would have been the most troublesome opponent,
with this, he's utterly useless in battle.
Truth is cruel.
Out of the cocky ones who tried to revive the dead in order to be embraced by their mother's warmth again,
one of them was robbed of his leg with which to stand, and his one and only brother was also taken from him.
The other was stripped of his entire body which left him unable to feel warmth at all.
The woman who longed for her dead child was given a body no longer able to reproduce.
Now, the one who had his eyes fixed on the country's future was robbed of his vision;
never again will he be able to see what the future holds.
He gives humans their suitable forms of despair to prevent them from getting too conceited.
He is the existence which you humans refer to as 'God'.
Truth.
How is that fair?!
Those of us who acted on our own initiative certainly deserved it.
But someone who wasn't even willing was dragged into human transmutation, robbed of his vision,
and you say that's well-deserved?
Truth is too illogical for me to accept!
Are you planning on getting in father's way?
What is your true name?
I have no name.
I've disposed of it.
What a coincidence.
I, too, do not know my real name.
A duel to the death between two nameless beings shall make quite a show.
May!
There he is.
How dare she open up a hole on the roof of my house...
He looks different now, but judging from that aura...!
You're the immortal leader, aren't you?!
Sir Alphonse?!
What happened to you?!
I don't know.
He just won't wake up.
No way!
Sir Alphonse! Sir Alphonse!
Please, wake up!
Sir Alphonse!!
It's...
It's... my body...
I've been waiting for you.
Welcome back.
What's with this thin arm?
I'm skin and bone.
I'm barely able to stand.
I...
There's...!
There's no way I'll be able to fight with that body!
Everyone's giving their all!
You don't want to reunite with me?
Of course I do!
I've... I've always dreamed of getting my body back!
But...
Not now.
I won't be able to fight with that body!
Not with that body...
Do you want to go back to the other side?
Would you like to go back with that body?
If so, I won't stop you.
Sorry.
I'll come again.
Hang in there for a little longer!
I'll definitely come again!
I swear! It's a promise!
Al!
You okay, Al?!
Sir Alphonse!
Al!
Master.
Brother.
May!
Wait, where am-
In order to help your friends,
you leave behind the body you've been longing after for years.
My soul, you are beyond dignified.
I am nothing but proud to be your container.
But the fact that you went back may lead to the world being submerged in despair,
Alphonse.
That...
...makes all five of you.
Bravery is forded down to the ground by power,
and happiness shattered to a million pieces.
Next time, Fullmetal Alchemist:
Episode 60, Heaven's Eye, Earth's Gate.
The world became engulfed in darkness.You've got quite the nerve to pick a quarrel with me, Giolio Comanche, the Silver Alchemist.
However...
You're pretty good to get out of that with only a scratch.
Only a scratch?
Who the hell is that?
Master, you're back!
I'm asking who the hell that is!
Nice to meet you! I'm May Chang!
Episode 15, A Messenger from the East.
When I was unconscious on the roadside, I was saved by Sir Yoki, your master.
My master?
You're feeling better now, right? Then get out of here.
What do you want?
Allow me to seal your wound.
What?! It healed?!
It's called Eastern Alchemy, from the nation of Xing.
Xing?
Yeah! According to her, she crossedthe great desert of the east all by herself.
How stupid can you get?
I didn't cross it by myself!
I had a companion with me!
Companion? Oh, you mean that little thing?
Yes! Her name is Shao May!
This is... Eastern Alchemy, is it not?
A technique comprised of understanding and utilizing the veins of the dragon, power that runs through the earth...
This tattoo is used to draw power from our Eastern Alchemy.
My older brother studied bothEastern Alchemy and Western Alchemy.
This tattoo is the outcome of his research.
Oh my! Your brother must be a really talented individual!
I have no idea what you two are talking about,
but since your wounds are all healed up, we can go back to Central now, right?
If that's the case, I'll get ready right away!
Hey! We told you to get out of here!
We're not going on a trip, you know!
I'm serious, too!
That immortal crap you were talking about earlier?
There's no way something like that could exist.
But it does! That's the reason why I-
Shut up! Brats like you should be on the playgr-
Immortality couldn't be achieved through Eastern Alchemy.
But maybe with its Western counterpart...
That's why I must meet that man I keep hearing stories about!
Blonde hair, golden eyes, wearing a red coat so elegantly...
A genius alchemist that saves people in a splendid manner...
Sir Edward Elric!
What should we do, Master?
I couldn't care less.
What's wrong, Black Hayate?
You don't want to be walking alone at this hour...
It's quite dangerous because...
...you could be attacked by me, Barry the Chopper!
What the hell was that for?!
Dammit! In that case...
...what do you think of this?!
W-Why aren't you shocked at all?
I know someone who's sort of like you.
Like me? Alphonse what's-his-name?
You know Alphonse?
So you're a friend of his, eh?
But I must say, lady...
...you're really strong!
The philosopher's stone.
I wouldn't have guessedResearch Laboratory 5 was involved in its refining.
There's a possibility the upper echelon of the military also has something to do with it.
And ones by the name of Lust and Envy...
Are they the ones who turned you into that?
No, this was done by the scientists.
They pulled my soul out of my body.
We might be able to find out who instructedthe experiments if we interrogate the scientists...
That can't be done.
None of them are left. They were also used as ingredients for the stone.
That way none of the information gets leaked. Two birds with one stone.
I wonder if this means they don't need to create any more stones?
Last question for you.
Are you the one who murdered the military officer about a month ago in a phone booth at Central?
I don't even know what you're talking about!
Was he cut up?
No...
I'll take your word for it.
Yo, Miss Winry!
How are you doing on this fine day?
Ed! Al!
What brings you here all of a sudden?
Geez...
Even Paninya has picked up a job and is working seriously...
Paninya?
Yup.
She stopped pickpocketing, and now she fixes roofs and does all sorts of high-altitude constructions.
Wow...
And what about you two?
Any progress at all?
Well, we're taking the long way, but...
We're slowly making our way... I guess.
Well, that's good to hear.
There! Temporary repairs complete.
Thanks, Winry!
I don't have enough parts right now to fix it up completely, so bear with that for now.
All right...
I'll go buy them right away, so could you go kill some time?
But what's there to do?
There are only automail shops here...
Al.
Brother...
What, did you find a cat or something?
Yeah.
I'm alive!
You guys saved my life! Thanks!
Oh, and thanks for the food!
Never said I'd pay for it.
Don't mind such a small thing!
Don't say small!
To be cared for in a foreign land... I'm so thankful.
"Foreign land"? Are you not from this country?
Yep! I came from Xing!
Xing...
That great nation to the east?
That's right! Crossing that desert felt like walking through hell...
But why did you take that route?
I wanted to see the Xerxes ruins.
Xerxes?
I heard there's nothing there.
Just a bit of research.
I came to this country forEastern Alchemy-related research, too.
Eastern Alchemy?
Oh right, you just call it alchemy in this country, don't you?
The alchemy in our country is a skill that is used predominantly for medical purposes.
Different customs, I guess.
It's mostly used for war in our country.
Skirmishes are still ongoing on the border with Aerugo to the south and Creta to the west.
And there's still the great nation of Drachma up north, too.

Our relations aren't looking too good.
Such a scary country to be in...
This country's been so military-focused ever since King Bradley became the FÃ¼hrer President.
But I'm really curious.
About this Eastern Alchemy that's used for healing.
Me, too.
Oh, could you guys be alchemists?
Yeah.
I'm Edward Elric, a State Alchemist.
I'm his younger brother, Alphonse Elric.
Nice to meet you.
I'm Ling Yao!
The pleasure is mine.
Hey Ling, could you explain your Eastern Alchemy to us in detail?
Can't!
I'm not an alchemist.
What the hell did you come to research if you're not an alchemist?!
Just a little something.
You guys might know something about it...
The philosopher's stone.
I really want it...
Do you know anything about it?
Nope.
Can't say I do.
Seems like you do.
Care to tell me?
What do you plan to use it for?
To find the way to gain immortality.
Care to tell me?
Immortality? How stupid.
I'm totally serious.
Besides...
This doesn't seem like the right attitude to have...
...when asking for a favor!
Brother!
You're going to retaliate, too?!
H-Hey!
What are they, acrobats?
Martial arts from Xing, maybe?
This might be tough...
But still...
Yeah...
They're nothing...
...when compared to our Master!
What's that?
And there they go.
Old man, can I get some dessert?
Sure!
Shit!
Dammit...
All of a sudden demanding information on philosopher's stones and immortality...
...and then picking a fight with us...
What the hell are you guys up to?!
You, and that thin-eyed bastard!
I hit him?
Oww...
This guy went nuts right after I called Ling a thin-eyed bastard...
I get it...
Oh! Long time no see, Paninya!
What the heck are you doing?
Well, I guess I can kind of see the situation...
Oh, Paninya, can I ask you for a favor?
How strange... I can't seem to sense a flow of energy from that armored man...
What's going on...
You thought you'd stand a chance if you added allies?!
You fool!
What's wrong? What's wrong?
I can read your moves now!
If his subordinate is like this, then I guess that thin-eyed bastard isn't that big of a deal himself!
Just as I thought... This guy getsall worked up when his master is insulted.
And when that happens...
Your attacks become simple and easy to read!
Well then, I guess it's about time you revealed your face!
A woman?!
To have an internally mounted cannon...
I can't take this country lightly.
Well, I guess that wasn't bad for my first try.
Alchemy...
You did this without a transmutation circle?!
Well, then...
I wonder if Brother is doing okay?
I went a little overboard...
What should I do...
Master Ling is going to scold me...
Come on, missy.
What the hell are you using in a town?
If it hadn't been me, you would have killed someone!
Bastard... You broke your arm?!
I chased rabbits all the time when I was a kid.
Traps are my specialty.
Brother!
Yo, Al.
Good work, everyone!
You... coming out like that!
Man, you guys are really strong.
How about it? Become my underlings and let's rule a country?
Quit daydreaming!
How about you go back-
There they are!
You guys sure destroyed a lot of our city.
I hope you plan to pay for it.
Don't forget to pay for all that food, too.
H-Hang on a sec!
All the repair and the meal costs should be for these guys...
I no really understand this country language!
Bye-bye!
Get back here!!!
Huh?
He got away!
That one, too?!
What should we do...
I'd like to fix it all, but I'm kind of...
It's all right, Brother... I'll do it.
Huh? You can do it without a transmutation circle now?
Yeah. I think it's because my memories of the truth returned to me.
Which means...




















Just leave the rest to me.
What's wrong, Brother?
We're back!
Hey, we meet again!
What are you sitting there drinking tea for?!
That's horrible! I thought we were friends...

Do you know what we went through because of your two subordinates?!
I'll scold them later, so forgive us, yeah?
The girl is Lan Fan,
and the old man is Fu.
They're from a clan that's served my family for generations.
Don't be too angry at them.
You leech off of me for food and you havetwo companions with you? You seem like a rich guy.
Well, I'm a prince, after all.
Huh?
Prince?
You?
A prince?!
Isn't this the part where you're supposed to be astonished?
Sorry, it was just too unexpected...
A guy who passes out from hunger and then leeches off of people for food... a prince?!
I won't allow you to speak ill of Master Ling...
You were here all along?
Well, I guess "prince" doesn't really mean much.
Since there are so many of us princes.
Xing is a nation made up of more than fifty different clans,
and the emperor reigns at the top of that.
And a daughter of the chief of each clan marries the emperor and bears a child.
The current emperor hastwenty-four sons and nineteen daughters.
And I'm twelfth in line for succession.
Forty-three kids?
Aren't there ever disputes over who becomes heir?
We're right in the middle of that.
The Emperor is in very poor health right now...
Each clan is getting worked up to curry favor with him, since this is the best time to do so...
Which is why I'm also...
Going to offer up immortality to gain his favor...
Correct!
So please, won't you tell me?
Information about the philosopher's stone.
Nope!
Philosopher's stones aren't tools to be used for promotion!
If you won't tell me, I'll follow you forever!
Don't!!!
I'm back!
There seemed to be a huge commotion on the main street, so I got kinda held up-
Why is it torn off?!
Seriously!
Every! Single! Time!!!
Young master!
You don't need to bow down to those lowlifes...
If one bow from me would do the job,that'd be really cheap.
The fate of 500,000 people in the Yao clan is in my hands.
My image is the least of my concerns.
So, where are you planning on going next to break your automail?
Why do you assume I'm going to break it?
We're thinking of going to Central to look something up.
Huh? You're going to Central?!
I want to go, too!
What for?
To give my regards to Mr. Hughes!
But don't you have work to do, Winry?
Not a problem at all, Winry.
You need to take a breather every now and then.
Really?! Thank you so much, Mr. Garfiel!
Well then, I guess...
We're all headed for Central!
Yep!
It'll be quite a trip! I'm so excited!
You're not coming!!!
She came along anyway, didn't she?
Oh yeah, I still don't know your name, Master.
Won't you tell me already?
Ishbalans consider their names gifts from God and speak of them with honor.
My my... You must have a grand name...
Therefore, I got rid of my name.
Go! Keep moving!
Y-Yes sir!
If I'm on a path of no return...
...I'll get rid of everything I've ever received from God.
A sad truth greets Ed, Al, and Winry, who returned to Central with the hopes of a warm reunion.
And the darkness chooses another, new sacrifice.
Next time, Fullmetal Alchemist:
Episode 16, A Comrade in Arms' Footsteps.
Is it light or darkness...
...within the heart of the man who began to move forward?To obtain more information aboutthe transmutation of living organisms,
Ed and Al visited Shou Tucker, the Sewing-Life Alchemist.
At his house, they met his daughter, Nina, and their dog, Alexander.
In order to pass the assessment for State Alchemists,Tucker transmuted a chimera using Nina and Alexander.
Nina will never be able to return to her old self.
Ed was grief-stricken by his powerlessness.
Episode 5, Rain of Sorrow.
Mom! Mom!
What's the matter, Ed?
A present for you.
I transmuted it myself!
Is that so?
You're Daddy's son, all right.
Thank you.
You're really amazing, Ed.
To be able to make something wonderful like this.
But...
You... couldn't make me correctly, could you...
Onii-chan.
Let's play.
Are you all right, Brother?
Seemed like you were having a nightmare.
What's the matter, you two? Isn't ita bit early in the morning to be here?
Umm...
So what's going to happen to Tucker and Nina?
Mr. Tucker was supposed to be put on trialand have his State Alchemist qualifications stripped...
...but both of them died.
"Died"?
I'll go ahead and let you know now, since you'll find out sooner or later.
They were killed.
Why?!
By who?!
We don't know.
I'm about to head to the scene myself.
We're coming with you.
I can't allow you to.
Why not?!
You're better off not seeing it.
Looks like we were a bit late.
We'll have to go after him soon. Or else...
You sound as if you knew this was going to happen.
What's this about?
God has given us a trial!
Evil heathens are trying to disturb our faith by spreading absurd rumors, and the military is planning to oppress us!
But we shall not give in!
Take up arms and rise!
In the name of our almighty Sun God, Leto!
That's right! We've got the Sun God Leto on our side!
Shoot the heathens!
Hey! Don't let him trick you!
That bastard has been lying to us!
Shut up!
You guys are agents of the heathens, aren't you!
Humans are oh so silly.
Don't you agree, Gluttony?
Foolish! Foolish!
Yeah, seriously.
Oh my, Sir High Priest.
Sir!
Sorry for giving you so much trouble.
I'll be returning to my assigned town once all of this is over.
The fullmetal boy got in our way, but we were able to make good use of him in the end.
Looks like this'll be over quicker than we'd expected.
All of this happened just because you manipulated a bit of information and I stirred the believers.
Humans are such simple beings.
Blood calls for blood, while hatred begets hatred,
and the energy that comes forth begins to take root in this earth and engraves a crest of blood.
They never learn, no matter how many times history is repeated.
Humans are foolish, sorrowful creatures.
But that's why we can have them play right into our hands, is it not?
Will more people die?
Yes, they will.
Can I eat all the ones that died?
No eating.
In any case Envy, just how much longer do you plan to stay in that form?
It's kind of gross.
Oh come on, I'm just going with the flow.
But I guess it's better to transform into someone young and cute, huh?
M-Monster!!!
What's this?!
The High Priest...
What happened to the real High Priest?!
What do we do?
He called me a monster. How rude.
Can I eat him?
Oh yeah, I heard Shou Tucker from East City was killed.
Tucker?
Ah well, who cares about small fry like him?
Well, the guy who killed him is none other than that guy.
If we're talking about East City, isn't the Flame Colonel stationed there?
Yup. The fullmetal brat is there, too, it seems.
Fullmetal...
It makes me mad that he interfered with our work, but we can't let him die.
He's an important human sacrifice, after all.
Thanks for the meal!
Got it. We'll take care of it somehow.
So, what's that guy's name again?
Scar?
Scarred man...
Yeah. We don't know anything about him,so that's what we call him.
We have no idea what his aim is, and he's extremely elusive.
All we know about him is thathe has a large scar on his forehead.
I've heard rumors about him, but...
So that's who you guys have been after.
It was on the recommendations from military police headquarters.
I've got so much work from the chamber of military, too.
Seriously, all this is giving me a headache...
We've got five casualties so far in Central, ten nationwide. All State Alchemists.
Old man Gran was killed five days ago, too.
Brigadier General Gran?!
He was the lead of weapons transmutation and troop combat divisions!
That's how much trouble this guy really is.
Listen to me. Deploy more guards and stay put for a while.
I'm asking this as a friend, too.
The only famous alchemists around here were you and Tucker, right?
Shit!
I've always been thinking.What is this alchemy we believe in?
"Alchemy is understanding the various rules and flow that exist within matter, breaking it down, then rebuilding it."
"This world also flows while abiding by those rules and is in a cycle."
"Death is also a part of that flow. Accept the flow entirely."
That's what our master always said, isn't it?
I thought I understood.
But I didn't.
That's why we transmuted Mom...
And even now, I'm thinking whether I could somehow fix something that's impossible.
I'm an idiot.
I haven't grown one bit since that time.
I thought that rain would wash away these pent-up feelings...
But every drop that hits my face makes me more miserable.
I can't even feel the rain hitting my skin because I have no body.
That by itself is lonely and cruel.
I still want to return to my old body. I want to become human again.
Even if it's impossible and is against the ways of this world.
You're Edward Elric, the Fullmetal Alchemist, aren't you?
Brother!
What the hell is this about?!
Who the hell is this guy?
This is bad... This is bad!
I've got to get away!
This is bad... This is bad!
Al, run!
I won't let you get away!
Brother!
Al, hang on!
Dammit, what the hell?!
I haven't done anything to set anyone against me-
Scratch that, I've done a lot.
I haven't given anyone reason to go after my life, though!
Oww...
Who the hell are you? Why are you after us?!
Think of it this way:
If there is someone who created you,then there is someone who will destroy you, as well.
Looks like there's no getting out of this.
You've got some guts.
But...
Too slow.
Al!
It's empty?
You bastard!!!
Too slow!
Dammit!
Automail...
Makes sense. I wouldn't be able todestroy it with human destruction.
You guys are something else.
No, Brother!
You should run!
Idiot! How can I leave you behind and run?!
So you transmute by placing your hands together and forming a circle.
In that case...
I'll be destroying this annoying arm of yours, first.
Brother!!!
Now you can't use alchemy anymore.
I'll give you a bit of time to pray to God.
Brother, run! Brother!
Unfortunately, there isn't a god I want to pray to.
Am I the only one you're after?
Are you going to kill my brother... Al... too?
I will, if he decides to interfere.
But the only one to receive judgmentat my hands is the Fullmetal Alchemist... You...
All right...
Then promise me.
That you won't lay a finger on my little brother!
Brother...
I'll keep my word.
What are you saying... Brother?
What are you doing? Get out of there?!
Get up and run!
Stop it... Stop it.
Stop it! You bastard!!!
That's far enough.
You've made quite a mess of things, Scar.
I'll be taking you into custody under the offense of murdering a series of State Alchemists.
Alchemists are beings who alter the original form of matter.
In other words, an affront to God, the creator of all.
I bring judgment, acting as God's hand.
If you choose to get in my way, I will eliminate you, as well.
Interesting.
I don't want any of you interfering in this.
Colonel Mustang!
Mustang... The Flame Alchemist.
You came to me to receive judgment,saving me the effort of having to search for you.
What a splendid day!
You know my name, yet you're picking a fight with me?
What a fool.
What was that for?!
Colonel, please stay back.
You're impotent on rainy days, after all.

























Oh right, I guess you can't make sparks when it's wet like this.
It's awfully convenient for me if you can't make flames, State Alchemist.
I will destroy all here who interfere with my duty!
We'll just see about that!
Reinforcements?!
You're quite good to be able to dodge my fist.
You said you'd destroy everyone here, no?
Then try defeating me, first!
The Strong Arm Alchemist, Alex Louis Armstrong!!!
One after another...
This must be divine guidance, as well.
So you won't retreat, huh?
To show deference to that courage, I'll show you...
...a skill that has been passed down the Armstrong household for generations... Artistic Alchemy!
Who is he?
He's the one who murdered Mr. Tucker.
It was 
Major! Please try not to destroy too much of the city!
What are you saying?!
Destruction and creation are like two sides of the same coin!
You destroy and create! This, in other words,is the law of the universe!
But why naked...
That logic is crazy...
But other alchemists won't find it crazy, though.
Right, Scar?
So he's an alchemist, too...
I see. The three transmutation processes in alchemy are understanding, decomposition, and reconstruction.
But he stops at the point of decomposition.
He's an alchemist, too?
Then he is going against "God's path", isn't he?!
But... why is he only after those who possess a state qualification?
Agility that wouldn't be expected fromhis build and inhuman destructive power.
And on top of that, alchemy...
He's certainly troublesome, but...
Now you're stuck!
...this is when he takes a big swing!
Right here!
He pulled back?!
Did you get him?!
He's fast.
Just one hit, a graze.
Brown skin and red eyes?!
An Ishbalan?!
Looks like I'm surrounded...
Hey now, don't move-
Damn, the bastard escaped into the sewers...
Don't go after him.
Like I'd go after a dangerous guy like that.
Sorry about that.
You bought enough time for us to surround him, and yet...
No, I was more concerned withstaying alive rather than buying time.
Oh, is it over?
Lt. Colonel Hughes, where have you been?
I was taking cover.
Hey! Why didn't you at least give support or something?!
Shut up! Don't drag an ordinary guy like meinto you nonsensical mutants' all-around freak shows!
What are you gazing off into space for?! Don't you guys have work to do?!
Emergency deployments within the city! And be sure to whip up a description about the suspect, too!
Yes, sir!
Alphonse...
Alphonse!
Al! Are you all right?! Hey!
So that's Elric's younger brother...
Looks like they've got their own issues...
Al! Alphonse!
Why didn't you run away whenI told you to, you stupid brother!
Come on, I couldn't leave you behind and run away!
That's exactly why I'm calling you stupid!
What?! If I ran away, you might have been killed!
I might have not been killed, too!
Only an idiot would choose the path that leads to death!
Quit calling your brother an idiot!
I'll say it as many times as I want!
If you'd lived, continued to live, and survived,
and continued to study alchemy,
you could have found a way to get your limbs backand maybe discovered how to save people like Nina!
I wouldn't be able to forgive you if you chose to die by throwing all of those possibilities away!
My arm came off! You stupid brother!
We're really torn up, aren't we...
How uncool.
But... we're alive.
Yeah. We sure are.
This seriously is a special all-around freak show, isn't it.
Sorry for keeping it from you.
No problem, I won't tell the higher-ups.
It'll be somewhat troublesome if they find out, won't it?
Yeah...
We can play off the part about Edward's limbs,but we can't really make up an excuse for the younger one.
But seriously... we've got quite the ugly customer coming after us.
An Ishbalan, huh...
Ishbalans were a tribe of people in the Eastwho worshipped Ishvala as their sole creator and God.
There were a few cases of feuds after we annexed the country,
But thirteen years ago...
...when a military officer mistakenly shot and killedan Ishbalan child, the situation devolved into a civil war.
A riot called forth more riots, and the civil war eventually spread throughout all of the east.
The order given from the highest level ofour military after seven years of battle was...
...Ishbalan extermination.
Many State Alchemists were roped in to act as human weapons.
And the State Alchemists brought forth remarkable achievements.
That's why that man, who is a survivor of the Ishbalans, has a legitimate reason for wanting revenge.
Bullshit!
There's no legitimacy in revenge that drags in people who have nothing to do with it!

But the hard truth is he's hostile toward us.
And we can't die, either.
The next time we see him, we'll crush him...
...without any questions asked.
Yes, sir!
Ed, Al, what do you two plan on doing now?
We're going to move forward again.
We can't come to a stop as long as we're alive, after all!
Brother...
First off, I need to get my arm fixed in order to get your body back to normal.
Since I'm the only one who knows how to affix a soul to an armor.
You're right about that!
Guess we've got no choice.
What do you say we go and visit our mechanic?
We haven't shown our faces there in a while.
Winry's smile greets Ed and Al, who returnto Resembool to rest their battle-wounded bodies.
On the other hand, a philosopher's stoneappears before them, shrouded in a deep mystery.
Next time, Fullmetal Alchemist:
Episode 6, The Road of Hope.
The wind blows through the hill in the sunset.What does it bring the boy?Come on!
Drink up.
Pinako...
Mind if I join you?
Episode 27, Banquet at the Crevice.
It's nice to let loose like this every once in a while.
You probably think we're the most carefree people on earth, don't you?
But who can blame us?
This country's always at war.
And now there's something going on over in Ishbal... is that all this country is good for?
They never learn. 
Humans are foolish, pitiful creatures. 
With Ishbal and other riots...the East sure have their hands full. 
Not just the East, but there are riots and border warssparking up in the North and the West. 
Skirmishes are still ongoing on the border with Aerugo to the south and Creta to the west. 
And there's still the great nation of Drachma up north, too. 
Mountains of corpses everywhere, huh... 
We may even get a coup soon... 
Such a scary country to be in... 
This country's been so military-focused ever since King Bradley became the FÃ¼hrer President. 
Hey, let's dance!
You're quite the stud, Hohenheim!
Why don't you go dance by yourself?
But that's no fun!
This man isn't fancy enough to dance.
Come on, go dance with those girls over there.
I think that's about how old they were...
...when they started to even think about something like human transmutation.
Why didn't you take a stand astheir father and say something to them?
Even if I did, it wouldn't change the fact they'd have to repent for their sins.
You're harsh.
A sin is a sin.
Dammit!!! 
They took it away!!! 
Help me... someone... 
Mom... Mom... 
No way... No...  
This isn't... 
This isn't what I wanted!!! 
Al... Alphonse... 
Alphonse! Alphonse! 
Because of me... 
Alphonse!!! 
Dammit... Dammit!!! 
Give him back... He's my little brother... 
Whether it be an arm or a leg... 
Or even my heart! You can take it! 
So give him back... 
He's my only brother!!! 
A heavenly stone that destroyed Xerxes overnight. 
If we had this, we could get your body back... 
Doctor, what exactly were you ordered to research? 
The philosopher's stone. 
You mustn't desire such a thing. 
That is the Devil's research. 
You'll see Hell if you study it. 
"The Devil's research"... 
"Something you mustn't desire"... 
I resent you, Dr. Marcoh... 
The ingredients of philosopher's stones... 
...are live humans. 
Fragile beings, don't you think?
They cower at the darkness and don't try to stand up to it.
And instead, they try to forget it temporarily and try to escape from reality.
Humans are such weak creatures.
Well, let's have them be of some useto us as a precious resource.
Eh, Hohenheim?
"You may be able to reachthe real truth that is beyond truth"... 
What the heck is this? 
Could it be what's used to transmute philosopher's stones? 
Let's see how good you are. 
Looks like that arm saved your life! 
But my beloved sword even slices through steel! 
Brother! 
It's shameful, but we lost. 
You're not going to say something like, "Hey, we're actually a trio", are ya? 
We won't, we won't. 
Just destroy us already, boy. 
Spare me from having to murder someone. 
You consider us human? 
If I didn't accept you two as human,it would mean I'm doing the same to my brother, too. 
My little brother is human. 
And so are you two. 
That's why I don't want to kill you. 
Brother? 
Us two have been stealing, destroying,and murdering ever since we came of age. 
And we're being treated as humans for the first time, after being turned into this? 
Interesting.  
I'll tell you everything as a parting gift, boy. 
The one who created the philosopher's stone and told us to guard this place is... 
That was close. 
You can't be saying out things like that, 48. 
You're so annoying, dumbass! 
You guys were about to kill a precious sacrifice! 
Don't you understand?! 
Who the hell are you two?! 
What plan?! 
What do you mean by sacrifice?! 
You're a human sacrifice, right? 
Y-Yeah, that's right. I'm a human sacrifice! 
What the heck does he mean by that? 
...and perhaps their master, too... may also be a suitable sacrifice 
I'm sorry. 
You're a candidate for sacrifice, 
but you're going to die here. 
I've been thinking for some time.. 
...as to what you mean by "human sacrifice"... 
...and about what you are trying to make me do.. 
Riots throughout Liore. 
The ingredients of philosopher's stone are humans... 
What we did in Ishbal... 
Whoa now, who's the mastermind behind all of this? 
What you are trying to do right now... 
...is to create a giant transmutation circle, using this country and its people. 
And the purpose of that... 
...is to create a philosopher's stone. Am I right? 
Could it be that you actually knew?
Hohenheim.
Why didn't you tell anyone?
Hohenheim!
Even if I had, would that have changed anything?
What?
I've been watching them for some time.
The humans who continue to repeat the same mistakes without end.
And the same humans who had to helplessly escape from their actions.
Humans are fragile creatures.
I thought I told you. 
The philosopher's stone is my core. 
I'm a homunculus. 
You've heard of them, have you? 
Humans that were created artificially. 
That's what I am. 
We're all going to die here anyway. 
I'll show you something cool as a final gift. 
Can I eat him? 
Mustang!!! 
The monster was keeping another monster inside its belly! 
It swallowed everything around him! 
So even something like this is created... 
...by alchemy... 
Who are you, old man? 
Just as you have an ultimate shield, 
I have an ultimate eye. 
Oh, now I get it, Hughes... 
When you said that the army was in danger... 
...you didn't mean a crisis was approaching the army... 
You meant that the army itself was in a crisis. 
Father? You have a dad? 
I do. 
The one who created the homunculi? 
Yes. 
Humans don't have an ultimate spear or an ultimate shield.
Nevertheless, the most trivial things get the best of them, making them unable to get back up.
What can creatures like that do against homunculi?
Even so, we won't give up!
We wouldn't give up for the world!
That's also a human trait, isn't it?
How can you even move with that wound?! 
I sealed it with fire! 
Although I almost fainted a few times. 
No matter how many times you try, you can't win. 
How about you tell me the secret now? 
Thanks for that. 
The blood that was all up in my head went away, and I can think clearly now. 
You're still going to resist? 
Let this put you to sleep! 
This body comes with many inconveniences. 
But inconveniences don't make me miserable! 
There's no reason for you to pity me! 
My life was put together with alchemy by my brother. 
If I deny myself, that would mean that I'm denying brother, along with alchemy. 
I believe in the potential that alchemy holds. 
I want to believe in it! 
A State Alchemist! 
Get down! 
Hang in there... 
Don't die! 
D-Dammit... It won't stop bleeding... 
Someone... 
Live... 
You can't die. 
Lan Fan! 
Run! 
Lan Fan!!! 
My left arm is... 
What's wrong?! 
Young Master! 
I can no longer be of any use to you! 
Lan Fan?! 
Don't do it! 
Well played. 
No matter how many times we're stepped on...o matter how many times we fall...
We'll get back up and keep walking.
And someday...
That's just a useless struggle.
You don't know until you try!
It's better than not doing anything at all!
Are you fine with that?!
If Ed, Al, and everyone else disappears?!
Why are you getting so worked up?
Even if we do work for the sake of the humans,
they'll just end up dying in the end.
It all becomes wasted effort on our side.
In that case, don't you think it's wiser to simply grab what's important and run away?
What did y-
A bit of your conscience?
Or a worthless sentiment?
Eh, Hohenheim?
No matter how hard you try,no one will accept you anymore!
Just look at your own face!
Humans are nothing but a resource to be used.
And if you leave them be, they'll renew themselves.
Why would you need to do anything?
Would that change anything?
Would you be able to change reality?!
Would you be able to change how these weak humans are?!
We can change.
We'll be able to change.
I'm sure of it.
We really are weak creatures,
but that's why we can strive to become stronger.
Even if you feel it's useless,
each step we take leads to something great.
A subordinate protects their subordinate, and so forth. 
That should be possible, even for us puny humans. 
No... I wasn't prepared enough. 
Lan Fan was more prepared than I was. 
Seeing people die before my eyes... 
I hate it! I'm tired of it! 
I'm not going to let anyone die anymore! I'll protect you! 
No way in hell am I going to run! 
After I beat the shit out of that "truth" guy, I'm going to drag your body out of there! 
Al! 
Al! Come here! 
Hurry up! Al!!! 
Alphonse! 
Alphonse! 
Alphonse! 
Wait for me. 
That's why I'm sure we'll be able to change.
Because we're weak... and because death is inevitable...
Humans try their best to live and end up becoming stronger.
If your heart is still hesitating...
Try to remember.
The days you spent in Resembool with us.
A dream, huh...
Thanks for everything.
If you'll cower at the sight of the great foe before you,
leave at once, coward.
If you'll lose the strength you believed in,
then fall to the ground, weakling.
Now is the time for the decisive battle.
Humans, give it all you have.
Next time, Fullmetal Alchemist:
Episode 28, Father.Episode 44, Full Throttle.
It's been a while, Al.
Yeah.
So... I heard from Pinako.
About what happened to your body and such.
There he is!
Mr. Hoh, do you think you could lend us a hand?
Oh, sure.
Let's catch up on things later.
S-Sure.
That radio you guys fixed for me back then has been working great.
There's no static coming from it anymore.
I'm sorry. All of this happened because we messed with Cornello.
Hey, don't worry about it.
The city came to its senses because you two exposed his crime.
I guess there was a riot, but look at it now.
Aren't those beautiful sounds?
They're rebuilding the city.
Leaving no resentment behind.
I'll go help out too.
Please look after Winry for me, Rose.
I guess we'll see what we can help out with.
Let's go, Yoki.
Huh?
What about food?
It'll taste better if you eat 
Let's go!
Hey! Let go of me!
I want to eat!
Huh? That was your son?
Oh, that must have been awfully rude of us.
It must have been a while since you've seen him.Can you really just leave him hanging?
Well, I left the house many years ago.
I don't think he trusts me as a father.
Not really sure what to talk about with him...
Dad!
Umm...
I'll help too!
Let me take that for you.
Here.
How's the bath, Winry?
It's the best!
I don't even remember the last time I soaked in the tub...
I'll leave your change of clothes right here.
Thank you so much!
Rose's so sweet!
I find you really admirable, by the way.
You're so young, but you've already set yourself up in the automail business.
Did you make Ed's leg too?
Yeah.
We're old friends, so it was the least I could do.
That's amazing!
So you're the one who gave Ed a leg so he could stand up.
Then in turn, he gave me the strength to stand up.
So in a way, you saved me as well.
I was told my late boyfriend could be revived.
Hearing that and believing in their miracles, I gave myself up to Leto.
That was just around the time when Ed and Al came here and exposed the priest's lies.
What I've been clinging on to just disappeared like that, so I was feeling pretty hopeless.
And that was when Ed scolded me.
He told me to get up and keep on going.
I'm so sorry! He's always like that!
Why can't he be nicer about things?
It 
That was Ed's kindness.
You're aware of that too, aren't you?
Thanks to him, we came to our senses.
Everyone in this city, including myself.
We're all trying to get back on our feet without relying on miracles.
It's all thanks to Ed and Al.
Ed...
I followed those soldiers, but I ended up in some crazy place.
Mr. Greed...
What is and is not ethical changes with time and also depends on whom you ask.
That is not the reason.
It is to prevent an individual from creating a powerful army of their own, Major General.
They're not actually human...
They're dolls, I take it?
Precisely.
We will create soldiers by inserting souls into these humanoids.
They will be the ultimate soldiers that obey our every command.
In other words, an immortal army.
Do you mind if I ask something?
What is it?
Where would you obtain the souls to attach to them?
From the people of the countries we've crushed, and have yet to crush.
The battlefield will become a hunting ground where we can obtain thousands of souls.
Central is scary!!
It's unbelievably cruel!
There's no way Mr. Greed would be here!
An underground tunnel?
Yeah.
I wanted to check whether there's one under this city.
If there is...!
No, there has to be! Then-
Hold that thought.
Let's take this somewhere private.
So you came to Liore to prevent the activation of the Nationwide Transmutation Circle?
Yeah.
Then I found 
It makes me feel lucky.
We met a man who looks just like you underneath Central.
I seriously doubt that there's no link between you two.
I figured you knew who he was.
Are you sure this is a good idea, Alphonse?
What if I was on their side?
Didn't you consider the possibility that everything you just said could make it to the enemy's ears?
I'm really happy that you trust me.
Thanks.
Of course!
So he's trusting a failure like me as a real father...
Now...
I guess it's 
It's a long story.
I want Edward to hear it as well.
The thing is, Brother...
...has gone missing.
Can I help the next customer, please?
I'd like to make a withdrawal from State Alchemist Edward Elric's research account.
Would that be you?
No, I'm here on his behalf.
I have a power of attorney and also his signature.
Thank you, sir.
This is the northern branch of Banks Bank.
A withdrawal has just been made fromState Alchemist Mr. Edward Elric's account.
The man claimed to be here on his behalf.
Yes. He was a very large man...
Here's your money.
Okay. This should do.
Jesus, what a rip-off.
What are you talking about?
With the hush money included, this is just the right amount.
Well, we appreciate your not probing into our matters.
Darius!
They caught up to us.
Coming.
Oh my, a soldier.
Is someone injured?
We're looking for someone.
Is he your only patient?
Anyone staying in the back?
Just one in the back-
Are you the only one staying here?
Yes... can I help you?
You're the one who went to the bank, aren't you?
Don't move!
Halt!
Are you from this clinic?
Both hands in the air, slowly!
Have you seen anyone going in and out of this clinic recently?
His characteristics are...
What's wrong?!
Both hands in the air!
Red coat, blond hair in a braid...
...and very short.
What was that?!
Harris!
Get yourself together!
Who did this to you?!
Hey Harri-
Cohen! Harris!
What happened?! Say something!
Didn't bother to save any for us.
Don't push yourself.
You haven't fully recovered yet, have you?
Don't treat me like a patient!
I'm at full throttle and ready to go!
Thanks for everything, Doc.
No need to thank me. Just go already!
Try not to trouble us any further.
So they're looking for a blond guy in a red coat who has his hair in a braid...
Maybe I'll stay like this for a while.
Freeze!
Put down your weapons!
There's more of them?!
Hands above your head! Now!
You!
Get away from those two! They're dangerous!

You want to see this kid's head get blown off?!
We're going to secure a vehicle.
Right.
They're after us, Donkey Kong!
Don't call me that!
They're catching up!
They're from the northern army!
I can't outrun them in the snow.
That was close.
How's it looking like in the back?
Bad! They're catching up!
Dammit...!
Take that right!
Get on that street!
What?!
Don't ask questions!
Shit!!
I don't get you at all!
As soon as you get past the corner, make a u-turn!
Don't let them get away!
Huh?
W-Where did they go?
I think they made that turn!
That worked out well.
Hey... transmute it back to something simple.
Why?!
This looks badass!
Just do it!
Please, just do it!
What the hell?!
Do you have a problem with my design?!
Too many to list!
We have nowhere to go again.
Yeah.
I wasted so much time because I let my guard down against Kimblee.
I wonder if Al was able to meet up with Winry and them...
Hey, Fullmetal! You listening?
What do we do now?
Well...
I'd just like some information right now,whatever that may be.
We need to meet up with Al and the others.
So where are they?
Where do we go to meet up with them?
Where would Al go...
Think... Think...!
You listening?
Well... so...
You were a slave, and now you're a philosopher's stone?
Yup, exactly.
Guess it's pretty unbelievable after all...
Well, I don't blame you.
You'd have to be crazy to believe a story like that out of the blue.
Well... I guess I'm crazy then.
You accept things pretty quickly.
To tell you the truth, I'm pretty nervous.
But... I guess it's easier to believe because my body is also like this.
Hey... how does it feel to be immortal?
"How does it feel"...?
I guess it's convenient in many ways.
But it's sad that I have to see my loved ones go before me.
Mom?
Hey Dad, you're a philosopher's stone,which means your body isn't exactly normal, right?
Then are Brother and I...
Are you asking whether you two are normal humans?
Yeah.
Don't worry.
My soul is fused with the philosopher's stone,
but the actual core that holds me together is myself, a human being.
But the one at Central...
He's only wearing a shell that resembles me.
A shell?
Yeah.
So if you break the shell, you should be able to defeat him.
"Defeat"...?
Oh, right.
Aren't they trying to recreate the tragedy at Xerxes by using this country?
If we don't stop them soon, there'll be a disaster.
Whoa... not bad.
You've figured out this much.
And this one must be the reverse transmutation circle.
The quick way would be to destroy the underground tunnel.
That's why-
Don't even think about it.
A powerful homunculus by the name of Pride lurks in the tunnel.
But if we don't hurry, their transmutation circle will be...
It may already be complete, or has been for a while.
Then all the more reason to...!
"The Day" hasn't come yet.
"The Day"?
Alphonse.
Don't be focused on what's at your feet. Look above you.
If you do, you'll be able to see new things.
Above...
The sky?
Sun God Leto?
He's waiting for "The Day".
What the hell?!
What did 
Good!
Lively people like you make me smile.
You have no idea how boring it is to guard this place.
It's a real pleasure having someone like you visit.
The Ultimate Shield...!
Along with that tone and the way you laugh...!
Damn you for mimicking Mr. Greed!
That's right, I'm Greed.
Surprised you knew that.
The greedy...?
Yup.
This entire world belongs to me.
I want money, women, status, fame...
"And everything else in this world!"
No way...
But it has to be...
Who are you?
Mr. Greed!
Is it really you?!
What happened to you?!
I'm asking who you are!
It's me!
Bido from Dublith!
You forgot your friend?!
Dublith!
Ah, it all makes sense now.
Do you remember now?!
Sorry.
You're probably talking about the previous Greed.
Why...
I don't know you.
Mr. G...reed...
We're... friends...
Getting rid of intruders is my job.
Sorry man.
What's this?
You've got to be kidding me...
You've gotten pretty low, Greed.
Why the hell did you kill your own friend?!
He wasn't... my friend...!
Then what about these memories?!
Are you trying to say that Bido guy was spitting out lies?!
They're memories of the previous Greed, not mine!
Then why are you wracked with pain?!
Get your shit together, man!
If you start to lose it, my soul will steal back my body!
The previous Greed's soul had its memories wiped and purified.
I've forgotten all of my past!
My ass you did!
Friends are connected by heart!
You can't just rinse off something that's stained on your soul!
Look!
Your very being is crying out!
You've cut down a family member that was connected to you by soul!
Greed!
You're supposed to be greedy enough to want to keep 
You disgust me!!
What about this book?
I read it when I was about your age.
It's a tale about an adventurer who travels around the world.
What was that?!
Who is it?
The battle has begun.
No one can hold back his anger anymore.
Which one of them will survive?
And what is the truth that isgradually revealed after the duel?
Next time, Fullmetal Alchemist:
Episode 45, The Promised Day.
Those who share the same ambition, gather.S-Superficial?
In other words, chilblains.
You were close to getting frostbite.
If you walk around in a blizzard fora long time with an automail like that,
you'll get frostbite where it is connected to your body.
You also won't be able to move very well unless you change your oil.
Is that Buccaneer guy's automail made differently?
It's no good, Doc. I can't get this helmet off.
Hey! That's my head!
All automail here must be made to be flexible, lightweight, and resistant to cold.
So through trial and error, an automail made with duralumin, carbon fiber, nickel, and copper was developed.
I thought it was just made of iron.
No wonder I couldn't destroy it.
Hey Doc, you're not planning on spilling all the beans, are you?
Why, what's wrong?
He's a famous State Alchemist.
Are you sure he's real?
He has the silver pocketwatch.
A guy like this is of equal standing to a major?
If you're planning on staying up north for a while, you should switch to a cold climate automail.
Where does your automail mechanic work?
Rush Valley.
They knew a customer was heading up north and didn't even bother to tell you the dangers or offer a replacement?
Well... I didn't tell her that I was going to be up here.
If you don't want to die, you need to get it replaced;even if it means your mechanic has to take a trip here.
Fine.
That'll be 100 cenz for the coffee.
What a cheap trick...
And this coffee tastes worse than the one at Eastern Headquarters.
Your fault for letting your guard down.
So? What did you come here to do with that normal automail of yours?
Coming along without even passing through Headquarters.
That's right!
We came here with a letter of introduction to see if Major General Armstrong could help us out,
but that general didn't even listen to me and wasblabbering on about how she'd pluck my antenna off...
Did you call, little brat?
"L-Little"...
What is it?
If you've got something to say, just say it.
M-My hair...
I look ridiculous...
Episode 34, Ice Queen.
So... I hear you're on good terms with my little brother, Alex.
Is he doing well?
Yeah.
As muscular as always.
He's as cheerful as can be.
"Tch"?!
Nevermind that.
Moving right along, tell me why you came to see me without going through Headquarters first.
Don't forget to include why that armor is empty, as well.
It's actually... something I don't want a lot of people to know about.
You've got nothing to worry about.
Most of the people here have circumstances of their own.
It's not uncommon for us to have things we don't want others to hear, as well.
It's the kind of thing that could get mecourt-martialed if people were to find out...
I've done things of that caliber, as well.
Brother, listen.
I don't think she'll forgive us unless we tell her something.
But Winry is practically a hostage.
I have an idea.
Let's leave out the part about theFÃ¼hrer President and the homunculi.
What are you whispering on about?!
I don't have all day!
Then I guess we can just tell her,"We're on a journey to get our bodies back".
I see. So that's why you're looking for a girl who carries this cat around.
I get it now.
Then will you help us-
I get you are scatterbrains who act without thinking and end up adding fuel to flames because of your carelessness.
I don't want to keep fools like you in my castle.
Seriously... why don't the higher-ups at Central keep fools like you chained up?
Leave here at once!
...is what I'd like to say, but I'm highly interested in Eastern Alchemy.
You two are acquainted with that girl from Xing, right?
Yeah, I guess you could say that...
It's technology we don't have in this country.
I want it.
You can never have enough technology.
Especially in this land, where we frequently combat Drachma, a large nation.
Depending on how we apply it, Eastern Alchemy may become a useful combat tool for us.
Hang on!
Eastern Alchemy is especially versed in medicinal purposes.
Using that for war-
Did I give you permission to speak?
You're nothing but dogs that do nothing but bark within the borders of the country.
Don't you forget for a second that you fools are living in peace because there exist those who protect the borders.
I am in charge of protecting the northern border.
If the technique would be useful to my duty, then I'll take it. Whatever it may be.
Leave the search for the little girl to us.
I don't want you two out of the fortress.
And Major Miles.
Ma'am?
Give these two some work to do.
W-What?!
"If a man will not work, he shall not eat."
Can't argue with that...
They've got quite a rough history behind them.
Although they seem to be fairly experienced in combat, I now know that they're just brats on the inside.
Also...
It seems like they have some secrets they're not willing to share with us.
Hey, what are you going to make us do exactly?
The doctor said that a lot of people here havecircumstances of their own. Does that go for you, too?
So you ask us about every detail of our lives,and now you're ignoring us? Talk about unfair!
Do you really want to know?
Red eyes?!
An Ishbalan?!
Why...
I heard that all of the soldiers of Ishbalan descent were purged before the extermination...
I do have some Ishbalan blood in me.
However, my grandmother, my father, and my wife do not.
The colors of my skin and eyes came from my grandfather.
Amestrian...
You sure had your way withthe land of my ancestors, didn't you?
You Ishbalans burned down my hometown, too, and even killed my friend's parents.
Cut it out, Brother!
Sorry about that.
You're actually the first one who talked back after I said that.
You were testing me, weren't you?
I apologize.
It's just that people view me with pity after that civil war.
To be honest, I was getting sick of it.
But you were different.
Well, I've met Ishbalans who wanted to kill me, ones who tried to kidnap me, and others I've made peace with.
So I've been through a lot.
And besides, I believe it's possible for individuals to be able to talk as equals without having to worry about race.
Were you enlisted in the military during the extermination, Major Miles?
Yeah.
I served as assistant to Major General Armstrong then, too.
The extermination began as soon as I was stationed here,
and all of my Ishbalan relatives, beginning with my grandfather, were killed in the East.
My life was saved due to my narrowly missing the requirements of the purge statute.
Did you not come to despise the military?
You don't hesitate to ask anything, do you?
I hate being ignorant.
I apologize if I offended you in any way.
A State Alchemist being ignorant, huh...
I did despise what the military did.
And at the same time, I had doubts about theMajor General for keeping me as her assistant.
By having someone like me, a person with Ishbalan blood around, it could cause trouble with the soldiers here.
Yet, the Major General didn't exile me,so I turned on her in anger and demanded answers.
Briggs shall not fall, no matter what happens.
Every soldier here must be strong and flexible, fulfilling my every command.
They must make up a sturdy army that would keep calm under all circumstances.
In other words, there's no time for racism.


Follow my command without complaint, Miles!
Perfectly logical.
Not to mention that her words carried no deception.
I proceeded to ask her, "Even then, what if the Ishbalan in me couldn't forgive the army and took over my mind?"
How do you think she responded to that?
Very well. Bring it on.
I'll accept a duel from you at any time, as a representative of the army.
Is what she said.
What an evil woman.
It should be easy saying that with a battalion at her back.
No, I'm fairly certain...
I'll slice you up in a one-on-one duel!
...her eyes were saying that.
Are you aware of the universal law at this base?
"Survival of the fittest", was it?
That's right.
Ones without power will die,and ones with power will survive.
This is always true, under any circumstances.
It's very simple.
There are no underlings, bosses, and no distinctions between race, ethnicities, and gender.
There's a good example of the survival of the fittest concept.
You lived through it because you had good luck.
Looks like the guys who were supposed to be removing the icicles loafed on the job.
It's your job now.
I'll tell one of my men to give youa tour of the inside once you finish.
I can't reach that high!
Huh? Don't tell me...
Warrant Officer Falman!
Elric Brothers!
What are you doing here?
Speak for yourself! I thought you were getting transferred to Northern Headquarters!
I was actually sent here from Northern Headquarters.
You were promoted to Second Lieutenant!
Yeah.
Oh. Congratulations on your promot-
But why are you in charge of the icicles?
If you're here working the duties of the enlisted...
Looks like that'll be your last promotion.
Shut up!
This is the development lair.
Wow, what's 
They're developing weapons using the best technology in the country under orders from Major General Armstrong.
Even automails for combat?
Yes.
Let me show you something else.
This is the lowest level of Briggs.
It's really warm down here.
Totally different from how it is up at the top.
The lifeline of the fortress is gathered here.
Even if the top of the fortress is attacked,the central part underground will remain unscathed.
Out of my way!
Don't be milling around!
Sorry.
Hey Bobby, this way!
It's this pipe.
This sound...
It's coming from underground.
What?!
It sounds like... someone's digging.
Don't tell me the Drachmans are buildingan underground passage beneath the fortress?!
It's really close!
What a drag...
Really, what a drag...
It's such a drag, I could die.
But dying is also a drag.
Solf J. Kimblee?
He was badly injured on a freight train on the way here and was hospitalized at the foot of the mountain.
He requests that Briggs supports him.
Wasn't the Crimson Alchemist serving in jail?
Apparently, he was discharged.Under orders from the FÃ¼hrer President.
I don't like the sound of that.
What's the matter?!
Intruders, ma'am! From underground!
What?!
Homunculus!
Dammit!
So they knew we came up here to search for ways to fight against the homunculi?!
Don't fall asleep!!!
What?
Well, you know.
You heard about us from your Father at Central, right?
Y-Yeah.
We just came here to search for ways to get our bodies back...
Who... are you guys?
I... have to dig.
What a drag...
Such a drag...
Wait, could it be that he...
Yeah. Maybe neither Father nor theFÃ¼hrer President have told him about us yet.
You bastard! So you 
We're not!
Then why are you speaking to the intruder like you're friends?!
We're not friends!
You can't trick me!
This is in the way.
We're not lying!
We're just...
There's... so much room here.
Where am I?
Do I not have to dig anymore?
Fire!
Bullets are ineffective?!
Where... am I?
This is bad! He's headed for the development lair!
After him!
Contact the men up there!
We need to go after him, too!
Right!
He's huge...
It's... warm in here...
Stay where you are!
Put out the fire.
Roger!
I know I hit him...
It's no use, Boss!
Bullets don't work against him!
What did you say?!
All noncombatants are to withdraw immediately.
Shut off the alarm, too.
Don't let Drachma know about this commotion.
I've brought it, Boss!
Has it been tested?
There's no need for that.
It's the pride of us developers!
Remove the fuse from the shell!
Aye, ma'am!
First shell, loaded!
Fire!
Bull's eye!
Oww...
It's a drag to feel pain, too...
Don't just sit there!
Load the next shell!
Fire!
Oww...
Oh yeah, I forgot about my job.
I have to dig.
It's no use, General!
He won't die no matter what!
Won't die?!
What do you mean?!
Why do you know so much about that thing?!
I-I...
I don't like dilly-dalliers!
Answer everything that you 
How do you know about that thing?!
Are you a spy from Drachma?!
No!
Then is that thing a spy?!
I don't think so.
Does that thing know you?!
Probably not.
What 
I can't answer.
Who is commanding him to act?!
I can't answer!
And why can't you answer?
Please try to realize...
This is my last question.
Do you two plan to ally yourselves with us?
I don't want to see the people here die.
Tell me what his body is made of.
I'm fairly certain his body structure and composition are identical to humans.
Identical to humans, huh...
Buccaneer, bring me some tank fuel.
I'm going to pour it on him.
Roger!
I'm telling you, it's useless!
Even if you light him on fire, he won't...
I've already gathered from theprevious attacks that he won't die.
In that case, I'll just shut off his bodily functions.
I'll let him have something far worse than flames.
I'll show you how we do things at Briggs.
The bodies that clash against each other..
The shells that explode in the air...

Will it be us who will win the battle? Or perhaps...
Next time, Fullmetal Alchemist:
Episode 35, The Shape of This Country.
All that stands in our way shall be annihilated.
That is the law of the North.Episode 35, The Shape of This Country.
I'll show you how we do things at Briggs.
"How you do things at Briggs"?
That's right.
Lend us a hand, alchemist!
Brother!
You, too!
Hang on! We're...
You were threatened and forced to help.
No one can blame you for that, right?
Who's this?
He's our bro.
Okay. You're helping, too.
Pick up the pace! And don't spill any of it!
Buccaneer! Carry those to Gate 8!
Yes, sir!
Charge!
Shove him into the elevator!
What... a drag...
Push! Push!
All right! We can do this!
Turret, turn to starboard!
Yes, ma'am...
Miles, send him away!
Aye, ma'am!
All right! We did it!
Where... am I?
Now! Let him have it!
Good job!
Now what?
How do we throw him out of the gate?
This stuff smells.
Move, brat!
Hey! One more round!
We're out of ammo!
In that case...
That hurt...
All right!
It's north-blend fuel.
It vaporizes even in extremely low temperatures,and with that, it absorbs body heat in no time.
On top of that, we're in the middle of a blizzard.
He'll freeze all the way to his brain.
So cold...
My body...
...won't... move...
What... a drag...
Hibernate until spring comes around, dimwit.
Buccaneer, haul these three down.
Roger!
What?!
W-W-Whoa!
W-W-Why?!
We helped you!
"You were forced to."
Wouldn't that be more convenient for you?
And I'm not letting you get away until the identity of that monster becomes clear, so be prepared.
It's cold.
"Clang"?
Morning, Brother.
Oh, that's right.
Yo! Did you have a nice nap?
I did, but...
So I hear you saved our men.
Thanks.
That'll be 100 cenz.
This wasn't out of gratitude?!
Umm... are there any news?
The advance unit went to check up on that hole.
They should be back any moment now.
Oh, and Major Miles is at the hospital.
Hospital?
He's there to see the guy who was injured while fighting Scar.
Scar is up north, too?
Oh, there you are.
He's awake.
Thanks for yesterday.
You saved our buddies' lives.
You guys really care about your buddies, don't you?
We at Briggs consider ourselves a monolith.
And since you saved our buddies, that makes you one, too.
Then can't you let your buddy out of-
No can do.
You guys really are a monolith...
Apparently, Scar's body wasn't found at the scene of the accident.
There's a possibility he's lurking in the area.
Yes.
Good lord...
First, the cat... and now we also need to search for Scar?
Understood.
Leave Scar to us and focus on getting better.
Wait a second.
I want you all to stay out of this.
The Ishbalan is my prey.
Unfortunately for you, we're not so soft as to leta mass murderer do whatever he wants here at Briggs.
We believe in the survival of the fittest.
If you let your guard down for a second, you die. Understand?
Talk shit again, and you'll never be able to leave the hospital.
We at Briggs have been commanded to take care of you.
So stay put.
Just as I remember. Ishbalans are so interesting.
Are you doing all right, Kimblee?
You got here sooner than I'd expected, Lieutenant General Raven.
I rushed here after I heard about your injury.
You had me worried.
This is what you're worried about, right?
Very well.
Now, time to get to work.
But as you can see, I'm...
I brought a doctor well-versed in alchemy.
And we have the stone.
You'll be well in no time.
Eastern Alchemy is quite difficult.
Especially this whole concept of the "veins of the dragon".
It's to describe the power running through the earth.
Power running through the earth?
Simply put,
it's a power that goes back into the ground after erupting from the summit of a mountain, and enriches the earth.
Think of it as a river that runs through the earth.
By understanding that flow of strength, its entrances and exits...
You can apply it to practically anything.
When you say "anything", does this apply to the human body, as well?
Yes, it does!
For example... your hip!
My foot...
Or, right here!
Why did I feel that in my eyes after having my neck pressed?
You need to take care of your body, Dr. Marcoh.
The power in your body is stagnant in many places.
I-I see now...
So this is what makes long-distance transmutation possible.
So your alchemy doesn't use the veins of the dragon?
Yeah. We use the energy created by tectonic movements.
The immense amount of energy that is released by earthquakes and volcanic activity.
This country's alchemy uses that energy.
But that's not it.
Ever since I stepped foot in this country, I felt like something was out of place...
I finally realized what once I went underground in Central...
...but this power, which flows beneath our feet...
...feels more like it's coming from thousands of people squirming about...
...rather than energy created by tectonic movement.
It's huge.
A platoon should be able to get through.
The tunnel goes on indefinitely, following a loose curve.
But there aren't any signs of people down there.
Take the horses down.
Yes, ma'am!
And bring those three, too.
Wow... It really is huge.
I can't believe we let him break in without noticing all this was going on...
So this is the first time Briggs has been invaded?
Since I came here, yes.
But around twenty years ago, there was a case when our security guards were attacked during midwinter.
Apparently, a mysterious woman kept stealing food and supplies from them for an entire month.
I survived in Briggs in the winter for a month!
It has to be her...
I guess this is far enough.
Get off.
Now...
You don't have to worry about anyone eavesdropping on us down here.
Tell me everything you know.
I mean everything.
Don't hide anything.
When I asked you about the monster, you asked me to try to realize your situation, did you not?
More or less, you believed that I would realize your situation.
You could have been killed at any time in that situation, yet you still summoned those words.
So I figured you had something to protect,even if it meant you'd lose your life doing so.
For example, a hostage.
I want you to cut the bullshit.
Tell me the truth.
We need your help.
Philosopher's stones... Homunculi...
King Bradley, and a man who is referred to as Father...
And the entire upper echelon is guilty....
So as we thought, people were being taken hostage.
A friend of yours who is an automail mechanic and Mustang's men...
We performed many joint drills with Eastern Headquarters, so I know Hawkeye and Havoc.
It would be a big loss to lose them.
I wish I could do something.
Umm... what about Colonel Mustang?
Oh... I don't really care about him.
It would actually be better for me if he just falls, so I have one less rival to worry about.
More importantly, we need to decide what to do now.
How do you alchemists see this underground path?
I don't think this tunnel was dug from Drachma.
This is only a hypothesis, but it seems as though this tunnel was dug to create a large circle.
A circle?
A circle governs the circulation of power in alchemy and is an important factor.
Now, for the equation...
Lieutenant Falman, do you know the major incidents within the country that resulted in a lot of bloodshed?
Bloodshed?
How would that...
The Riviere Incident in July of 1558.
Let's see... Riviere.
The civil war in Cameron in October of 1661.
The Soapman incident, February 1799.
That happened in Fisk.
The Wellsley Conflict, March 1811.
The First Southern Border Conflict occurred inOctober of 1835, northwest of where South City is today.
The Second Southern Border Conflict happened in May of 1911, just south of Fortsett.
What about Pendleton to the west?
Many soldiers have died there in the battles against Creta, a neighboring nation.
And the riot in Liore, in 1914.
Severe casualties.
Wai-
A riot?! Why?!
Didn't we report the situation to Eastern Headquarters immediately after we exposed the fake priest?!
It was the Central Army.
They came and made the Eastern Army withdraw.
Liore turned into a mess after that.
No way...
Dammit!
Continue what you were doing earlier, Fullmetal.
I know.
Now we're going to connect the dots.
How could this be?!
It's almost identical to the transmutation circle we found under Research Laboratory 5!
A circle for creating a philosopher's stone, which uses human lives...
Just how many people will die with such a large transmutation circle?!
I once asked Envy if they were trying to create a philosopher's stone using this country.
But he laughed and told me I was close.
In the past, I told Edward that he'd surely be able to realize the real truth, which lies beyond the truth.
What I meant by the "truth" was that the stones are made of live humans.
And what I meant by "beyond the truth" is the existence of the ones behind it.
And the truth beyond the truth is the transmutation of a philosopher's stone using the entire nation.
But that's not where it ends.
We don't know what they're planning to do in the end.
We also don't know about immortality, which is what you're looking for.
So you mustn't long for a philosopher's stone.

Right.
The oldest one was in 1558...
Right after Amestris was founded.
Without even a declaration of war, Amestris invaded Riviere, which was once a neighboring country...
Hang on!
This is...
The military is involved in every one of these incidents.
The coup d'etat... the civil wars... and Liore, too.
The Central Army came out and poured oil on the flames.
Ever since this nation was created?!
Our country started out as a small nation, but we expanded by annexing the small countries around us.
So it was to create this circle?
So it wasn't their plan to use this country to do something, but they created this country to realize their task.
Our country...
So, Mr. Hughes...
Yeah. He saw the transmutation circle for the stone before he died.

He was the first to realize there was something wrong with this country-
Dog of the military. State Alchemist!
Do you have any idea what this country is trying to do?!
Do you really think all this prosperity was created with the powers of humans only?
If you 
I don't like this!
Looking at the pattern, the next area that will see bloodshed...
The only area left is Briggs!
What do those pigs at Central plan to do with my castle?!
Major General!
Please return to base at once.
Lieutenant General Raven has come to visit from Central.
So they're not even giving us time to think, huh?
Major General Armstrong.
There's something I'd like to ask of you.
Could you try and trick Lieutenant General Raven?
I'm sorry for making you wait, Lieutenant General Raven.
No, worry not.
It's my fault for coming here without advance notice.
Major General Armstrong will be back shortly.
Please, follow me-
Oh, that's right.
I've brought a guest with me.
Major Miles, do you mind giving him a tour of the fort?
Nice to meet you, Major Miles.
Winry's apple pie.
The thing I said I'd like to eat when I get my body back.
I guess we have more important things to think about now.
Don't worry, you'll be able to eat it someday.
After we get our bodies back and beat the crap out of those guys planning to use this country for their own goals.
Yeah.
Sorry for the mess, Lieutenant General.
We were attacked by the enemy.
Attacked?
We were able to drive it off,but the thing was... what you'd call a monster.
What do you mean by monster?
It didn't die no matter what we did to it.
Oh, my.
That sounds troublesome.
Personally, I think it's a biological weapon from Drachma, but the Elric Brothers...
We've taken in the Fullmetal Alchemist and his younger brother by chance.
It seems as though they know something about the monster but won't say anything.

Would you like to see them?
I guess so.
They really won't say anything?
Yes.
They also claim they came here to research organic transmutation or something.
They're being quite ambiguous. I couldn't doubt them more.
I thought about torturing it out of them, but I'm technically a woman, too.
I couldn't lay a finger on a child like that.
My heart would be crushed...
Yeah, right.
That queen's made of ice to the core.
So even you, who holds the title of "The Northern Wall of Briggs", has a soft spot for children, huh?
It wouldn't be odd to have a child or two at my age,but I'm totally behind in those affairs.
What are you talking about?
You must be much sought after by the men.
No, no.
It's such a sad experience to age, isn't it?
I'm absolutely horrified of aging.
That biological weapon from Drachma had a wonderful body.
An immortal body.
Isn't it like a dream?
What if I were to tell you that it may not be long before it isn't just a dream?
Say, Major General...
Are you interested in a perfect, immortal army?
He fell for it!
"Obey the ones with power".
That's the true meaning of the law of the jungle.


Next time, Fullmetal Alchemist:
Episode 36, Family Portrait.
Men set out on journeys with determination in their hearts.The sun is male, and represents a man...
And the moon is female; representing a woman.
When the sun and the moon come together, they become one...
...in other words, it represents a perfect being.
When they say "perfect being", are they talking about immortality?
My guess is that it's something even more incredible.
Like?
Like... God.
That's right, come!
I shall no longer be chained down by You!
I shall drag You down to earth and make You a part of me!
Is everyone okay?
What just happened?!
A job well done, my dear sacrifices.
So you actually did it...!
Yes, I've obtained God.
'God', you say?!
Cut the bullshit-
It's possible.
If you're in possession of a tremendous amount of energy, that is.
Energy?
A philosopher's stone!
You're joking!
So you mean, everyone has already been turned into a philosopher's stone?!
Just how many lives were lost...?
There are roughly 50 million people in this nation.
Episode 61, One Who Devours God.
Son of a bitch!
Shit!
I've sealed off alchemy.
Farewell, my friends.
That's...!
Now that I've devoured God,
it's not impossible for me to create a sun in the palm of my hand.
Should I let this loose right here and now?
The turnabout had already begun from the moment you were in possession of Him.
For this day and for this day only,
I had positioned my friends,my philosopher's stones, all across the nation...
...over a long period of time and with many calculations.
The time has come.
He did something he shouldn't have done.
We no longer have a body to return to.
However, the people of Amestris do.
Yes. Let us return their souls to their respective bodies.
Hohenheim asked us to, after all.
So all you did was to implant your philosopher's stones.
But those are just points.
Without a circle, there is no alchemy.
That's a basic principle of alchemy.
But there IS a circle.
A huge, powerful circle that'll activate by itself even if something were to happen to me!
The shadow of the moon that occurs from the solar eclipse!
We'll be going on ahead, Hohenheim!
You just continue to get in my way,don't you, Hohenheim?!
That's precisely what I came here to do,
Dwarf in the Flask, Homunculus!
Winry... are you okay?
What... just happened?
Did we lose consciousness?
It happened to you two as well?
Looks like it.
But that was...
How can I explain it... it was as if...
It felt like I was drowning in a whirlpool of suffering.
Did it work?
The souls of the people of Amestris were returned to their respective bodies.
He shouldn't be able to restrain this being he calls 'God' with only the souls of the people of Xerxes.
I can just create another philosopher's stone.
A hundred million, or even a billion!
Humans, an energy form, are an unlimited source!
May!
It's as easy as pie for an Eastern Alchemist to read and utilize the flow of the earth's energy!
The more power he has, the more power we have that we can use as well!
Sir, look out!
Dammit!
I don't have enough time to offset the energy!
Please hold out!
The defense circle will be destroyed!
It's impossible!
Stand firm, Dad!
You bastard, don't you dare give up!
Uh-oh.
I'm a terrible father, but I want to make you two proud!
If we don't hurry up, the philosopher's stone inside of Dad will run out!
Hurry up, Scar!
Ishbalan,
I thought that alchemy, the reconstruction of matter,
was a sin against Ishvala, the creator of all!
Have you abandoned your god?!
It seems as though...
...'God' is hardly significant to you all!
Nay!
After you learned the true meaning of despair...
...during the Ishbalan War...!
You must have realized somewhere inside of your heart!
God does not exist!
I believed in neither destiny nor a god,
but one would probably look at this situation and say that the heavens are not on my side.
The heavens brought forth a fitting visitor.
So you're here to avenge your grandfather...
That's fine as well.
Any last words?
Nay.
A sad life you led.
King Bradley, was there no one you loved?
Friends? Your wife?
Wife, eh...
You have no words to pass on to her?!
If she found out that you were a homunculus...!
Brat, quit blabbering on about trifling topics such as love and sadness.
Don't underestimate us.
She's the woman I chose.
A will is unnecessary between us.
That's usually how it is between a king and his companion.
Seems like you missed the chance to take revenge as you were caught up in foolish dialogue...
Although my life was lived atop a rail which was already prepared for me...
Thanks to you humans...
...I feel like my life was somewhat worthwhile...
A sign of life?
It's a philosopher's stone.
This?
Are you all right?!
Please take me to that spot...
The transmutation circle is broken!
It doesn't matter!
That's the center of it all...!
Got it.
Dear brother, to tell you the truth, I am not completely rid of hatred.
Yet, I'm currently trying to help the oneswhom my hatred is directed at: the Amestrians.
You once related it to the flow of positives and negatives,
but where will I, who carry both of those conflicting elements,
be carried off to?!
There it is!
Serves you right.
That chair you've been sitting high and mighty on is now in pieces.
You've had your share of fun for your lifetime, bitch.
I'll beat the shit out of both you and Truth!
Was that... Eastern Alchemy?
No, it's something my brother invented.
He used to research alchemy.
And from there, he began to research Eastern Alchemy from Xing.
Eastern Alchemy utilizes the flow of earth's energy.
Alchemy from Amestris utilizes tectonic energy.
But my brother realized...
...that alchemists are unable to use all of that power.
There's something in the way between the alchemist and the tectonic energy.
That feeling I got when I first came to this country...
...it felt as though there were people crawling about underground.
Right.
It's probably the philosopher's stones that were stretched across underground.
So Sir, the purpose of your transmutation circle was to return everyone's souls to their bodies?
Yeah, it worked out.
And the purpose of the Turnabout Transmutation Circle Scar activated was to fix this nation's alchemy.
After extensive research, Scar's brother began to doubt this nation's alchemy,
and additionally, learned of the existence of the Nationwide Transmutation Circle.
And with that at its base, and utilizing Eastern Alchemy for inscription,
he created the Turnabout Transmutation Circle; one that would nullify the power of a philosopher's stone.
And with this, alchemists are able to use all the tectonic energy to their liking,
something that used to be disrupted by philosopher's stones.
Keep it up!
Make him use his philosopher's stone!
He'll eventually run out of energy!
And when'll that be?!
I don't know!
But all we can do is try!
Eat this!
This brings back memories.
I remember bathing in that once.
Why don't you take a soak too?
Out of the way, Greed!
Freeze!
Now, slowly...
Lieutenant Hawkeye?
Major!
He must have gone up to create more philosopher's stones.
We're going after him.
Right!
We'll get you somewhere safe too.
Sorry about this.
Why am I so useless when people need me the most?
Brother!
You go on ahead, Al!
Seems like he wants a piece of me.
Let's go, Al.
Don't die now, Ed!
Yes'm!
Dear!
Izumi!
We don't have time for this.
Take care of the colonel.
Right!
Colonel!
There's someone that needs a real good spanking, so I'll be off!
Are you injured, Colonel?
They took my vision.
What about your wounds, Lieutenant?
Seriously...!
Please worry about yourself!
Your eyes...!
Can you still fight?
Yes!
Young master!
It's Greed.
Geez, you followed us all the way down-
Wrath!
So he bit the dust...
You look so damn satisfied.
Pisses me off.
Greed...!
Throwing away his pride as a homunculus... how pathetic.
Why are you guys so obedient towards a father like that?
What a stupid question.
Isn't it obvious that we'd obey our own father?
You're the stupid one here.
"Obvious" you say?
You won't even try thinking with your own brain!
I don't get it...
Why do you continue to obey him?
He doesn't give a damn even if you're badly hurt like that.
So what?!
Don't apply this "common knowledge" of your human race to us homunculi!
This container won't last for very much longer.
But since you, like our father,have Hohenheim's blood in your veins,
we're pretty much siblings.
Edward Elric, give me your body...
...a container!
What?!
Unamused.
I'm thoroughly unamused, homunculus Pride.
Kimblee?! There's no way!
How could you maintain your own self-awareness in this tempest of souls...?!
Tempest?
You make me giggle.
Voices of resentment are like a lullaby to me.
Why are you interfering with me, Kimblee?!
Well, I wouldn't have done anything had you kept on fighting while conserving your pride as a homunculus.
However, first, you blab on about your pride as a homunculus,
then just as your life is in danger,
you proceed to escape into the container of a human, a being you looked down on as inferior.
You...
...lack elegance.
I'm going to be killed!
You don't understand Edward Elric!
Selim!!
Impossible...!
He turned himself into a philosopher's stone to infiltrate me?!
I've got you now, Selim!
Stop...
Stop...!
Please, stop!!
So this is your true self.
I'd better go and apologize to Madam Bradley after all this is over.
Just wait there, stupid brat.
Mommy... Mommy...
































Muscles grunt and fire roars.
Humans fight to the death with their existence on the line.
This is the final battle.
Next time, Fullmetal Alchemist:
Episode 62, A Vehement Counterattack.
If one wishes to gain something,one must present something of equal value.Ed and Al were searching for May, a girl from Xing, to find out more about Eastern Alchemy.
They are now headed north after learning she was headed in that direction.
At the same time, Kimblee, the Crimson Alchemist, is after Scar, who had just left Central and is now westbound.
But Scar suddenly disappeared in the darkness of the night.
If they were to jump off the train, it would surely be around here, where the track is full of curves,
since the engine would decelerate.
Now the question is, where did they go after they jumped off?
Have there been any sighting reports on Scar?
None at all, sir...
That's very strange.
He had been attracting a lot of attention up until this point.
Reporting in, sir!
A small boat by the river has been stolen about 200 meters south of here!
Was it Scar?
There haven't been any sightings so far.
Go investigate.
Roger!
Reporting in, sir!
We've received a report from an old man, who lives in the area, of two suspicious-looking men heading westbound.
Now they're heading west?
Send some men over and capture those two immediately!
Roger!
Is something the matter?
No, it's just that...
There's a mountain trail on this map that heads north.
Why is it crossed out?
There used to be a path throughthe forest to get to the northern area,
but it's been closed down due to landslides.
What about the path, sir?
There are several other places beyond this point that have been closed off due to landslides.
It looks like the stream has moved.
It seems so... but are you saying it means something?
For an alchemist skilled in destruction, removing an obstacle such as this is a walk in the park.
It's also simple to destroy the surface of a mountain and to block off the road with the rocks.
Signs of transmutation?!
Send the troops north.
Episode 33, The Northern Wall of Briggs.
Snow!
Brother!
Geez, you're so fidgety!
Shut up, I just slipped.
Man, look at all the snow!
Yeah. We rarely see snow in Resembool.
Oh yeah, Al.
Do you remember when it snowed heavily in Resembool when we were kids?
Heavy snowfall?
Oh, I remember now!
We had a snowball fight!
We made a snowman, too, remember?
Yeah!
Back then, I never would have thought that I'd come this far north...
But we did, didn't we?
Well, what to do now?
We've still got time until the train to Briggs departs.
Why don't you go eat something nice?
I'm not really hungry...
But I guess I'll go see what's on the menu!
Hey! If you start running, you'll slip again!
Shut up!
Yes. Three hours ago...
Scar's description, document number, and...
Any new information so far?
We're trying our best, but we haven't found anything yet.
A man matching Scar's description was sighted at the marshalling yard at the next station.
Is this confirmed?
Yes, sir.
He was last seen climbing intoa troop transport headed for Briggs.
Was there anyone with him?
A middle-aged man with black hair.
Matches the initial report perfectly.
We'll have the train stopped immediately.
There's no need for that.
It would be troublesome if they leap off again.
I'll take over from here.
Please don't interfere with my work.
Sleep for now.
When we get further north, you'll havea hard time sleeping because of the cold.
I'm jumping over. Please try to match the speed of the other train.
Yes, sir!
Dr. Marcoh.
I've come to pick you up.
You've got nowhere else to run.
Are you alone?
Where is Scar?
You just don't know when to quit, do you?
Didn't I just say you had nowhere else to run, Doctor Mar-
Who are you?
So you're the Ishbalan everyone's talking about...
You can't expect me to put up with those monsters!
Now's my chance to jump off...
Impossible...
Solf J. Kimblee. The Crimson Alchemist.
Do you remember me?
Yes. Very clearly, in fact.
You were in the Kanda district of Ishbal.
Was it your family that was around you at the time?
I believe there was someone who closely resembled you, but with glasses.
Bleeding heavily from his left abdomen...
...and writhing in pain...
This isn't good.
I'm rusty from being in jail for all this time, but he's been fighting since the civil war.
In terms of stamina, I'm at a disadvantage.
However, all he can do is destroy-
Left abdomen, was it?
I won't give you the time to pray.
It's... a shame...
That I'd fail to kill the same Ishbalan twice...
How humiliating that I have to run away...
We'll settle the match next time, Ishbalan!
Kimblee!!!
Dammit, I can't see!
What the hell was that noise?
One of the cars is missing!
We can't! We've been ordered by the army not to stop the train!
No, we have to!
It'll be our fault if the train derails!
What... happened to you?!
Hey!
Who the hell said you could stop the train?!
What?!
Keep the train running.
Head north!
Good... death is chasing me.
Ones who kill are also chased by death.
Always living alongside death...
Jobs that risk one's soul are truly beautiful!
How rewarding...
My battlefield!
I wonder if Mr. Scar and Mr. Yoki are all right?
Since no one has come after us yet, it must mean they're doing a good job drawing the army's attention.
I hope they're safe.
Dr. Marcoh?
No, it's just that...
The northern wind is painful against healing skin.
Sorry. I wish I could have healed it to make it look a little better...
No, the face fits me well.
I'm happy with it.
Take a look, May.
Wow!
They're the Briggs Mountains.
The mountain range that serves as the border between our country and Drachma.
We should be close to the location Scar pointed out...
Let's see...
We're almost there!
Huh? He checked out of the hotel?
Yes, just yesterday.
Do you know where he went?
If I recall correctly, he said that they were headed north...
I see...
Thanks.
That idiot...
What's wrong? Were they doing well?
He said they headed north in that state.
Oh, my! He's totally...
...gonna die.
Did you catch a cold, Brother?
So cold...
It's Briggs, all right.
We're here, boys.
If you follow this mountain path, you'll get to the Briggs fortress.
Thanks.
Oh yeah, you.
Me?
Yeah, you.
That's not an automail, is it?
Nope.
Oh. Then you should be fine.
What was that about?
No idea.
Everything beyond that fence is owned by the army,so you'll die if you stray from the path!
Huh?
Let's go!
Yeah.
They say the weather changes rapidly in the mountains, but I never expected something like this...
What should we do, Brother?
We've completely lost our way.
Don't worry!
Master Izumi was thrown into the Briggs Mountains in the winter for a month for her training, and she still survived.
There's no way that could be true!
How could someone survive for a month out here?!
But she said she defeated a bear, too!
The bears at Briggs grow to a height of up to two meters!
Who'd be able to defeat one?
A bear!!!
That's not a bear!
Al!
Hey, hang on!
You're wearing a military uniform!
You have an automail, too?
Just an ordinary one, it seems.
Yours is just plain ugly!
How foolish of you to not understand the beauty of this arm!
Combat Model Automail M1913-A Crocodile.
Surrender if you don't want to be ripped to shreds, Drachman spy!
Spy?
What the hell are you talking about? I'm...
Why, you...
Can't you be a little more understanding, oaf?
What is this pain?
My automail isn't moving very well!
You're mine!
Brother!
You bastard...
Just listen to me!
You're still going to resist?!
Are you serious?!
Wait! Wait! Wait! Just listen!!
Your useless automail is mine!
More like, 
Did you do something?
Time out! Time out! Time out! Seriously! Time out!
Why doesn't alchemy work?!
This isn't made out of metal?!
Brother!
Thanks, Al!
Are you okay?
That freak...
I would've been killed by Winry before I froze to death out here.
Not bad, brat.
You did well for having a regular automail.
But this is it for you.
What?
Security personnel from Briggs?!
Geez, at gunpoint again?
Brother.
A wall?
What's the matter, Captain Buccaneer?!
I'm sorry for causing such a commotion, Major General Armstrong!
Armstrong?
So that's the person Major Armstrong wanted to introduce to us...
...Olivier Mira Armstrong?
Major Armstrong's sister!
But...
She looks nothing like him.
She's not huge.
Who the hell are you?
Edward Elric, the Fullmetal Alchemist.
I came to see you, Major General, with a letter of introduction from Major Armstrong from Central.
Please get these guys off of us, first!
Perform a full body check!
What?!
We're not suspicious in the least bit!
How should I know?
Anyone can pretend to be someone well-known.
What?! There's no one in here?!
That bitch...
Hm? This is...
Ma'am!
That's the letter from Major Alex Louis Armstrong.
If you read it, you'll know that we're not suspicious at all.
It really is from Alex.
You're not even going to read it?!
Testimonials mean nothing to me.
I don't need assessments made by others.
I'll judge you with my own eyes.
A-Amazing.
It's huge...
What the hell is this?!
Come in, Fullmetal Alchemist.
Awesome! It's so tall! It's huge!
Hurry up and walk, laggards.
Want me to rip that antenna off your head?
I'll tell you this now. I won't be treating you like a kid.
This is Briggs, the land of natural defense.
A world where the weak are victims of the strong.
There it is!
So these are his brother's research documents.
A combination of the alchemies from Xing and Amestris.
I wonder if there's anything about immortality in here?
I hope there is.
Now, will this become a book of hope,or will it turn out to be a book of despair...
Let's begin the analysis.
The general of Briggs, Olivier Mira Armstrong.
Fierce and powerful, she is Amestris' guardian of the north.
She has no fears, though there are many that fear her.
Next time, Fullmetal Alchemist:
Episode 34, Ice Queen.
This is how we do things in Briggs.Episode 51, An Immortal Army.
It hurts...
Help me...
I'm starving!
Water...!
It hurts!
"Not yet finished experimenting"?
This in itself is the experiment!
It was a success!
The ultimate soldiers that never die, betray, and always fight according to our orders.
An immortal army has been created!
Pa...pa?
That's right!
I am your father!
Now, listen closely to what I'm about to say.
Currently, there are several rebels targeting these headquarters!
Papa!
You all are to-
Ouch...
That hurts.
That hurts!
Pain!
That hurts...
Ouch...
It hurts...
The pain...
What a huge gate.
I don't like the feeling it gives off.
Is this really the place?
Yeah.
It looks exactly as Al described it.
Who the heck is that?
Number 66.
Barry the Chopper.
He was Slicer's partner.
Open...!
Dammit...!
How the hell are we supposed to open this?!
Step aside.
It opened-
Order the soldiers from Central that are fighting with the Briggs forces and Mustang to retreat.
Oh? Are you going to shoot?
Looks like your men aren't very disciplined.
If you don't hurry up and have them retreat,
the soldiers from Briggs will continue to fight with no mercy.
Wouldn't it bother you if you lost every single one of your soldiers?
Shut the northern, southern, eastern, and western gates that allow entry into the Central Headquarters!
Don't let a single enemy force from Briggs or Mustang's party enter!
So you're rotten, but it looks like you've still retained a set of testicles.
Don't get too cocky, bitch!
I'll have all of you monkeys from Briggs crushed-
Huh?
Oh, this one.
You're not supposed to interfere.
I was told to defeat you.
What a drag...
You've just created another spot for me at the top.
I thank you, homunculus!
You've saved me from having to stain this celebrated sword passed down in my family for generations!
You-
They won't die?!
It hurts...
I'm starving!
It hurts!
The pain!
Brother!
Don't tell me...!
Did they attach souls to dolls?!
Dammit! There's no end to them!
What the hell are these things?!
Hell if I know!
Why aren't they dying?!
This is bad.
If we were to let them outside...!
Did something happen?
No idea.
I heard Colonel Mustang pulled a coup d'etat.
How frightening.
There, there. Don't cry.
What do we do...
You-
Oh no! They're getting out!
My bad, I sealed off the exit.
Don't worry about it.
If you hadn't done it, I would have destroyed the exit myself.
Now we can prepare for the worst!
Okay, so now that we don't have to worry about them getting out...
...let's show them what we've got!
It hurts!
So much pain!
How dare they make something like this...!
Guess we have to go through these guys first to give the old guy a beatdown.
This is gonna be rough!
Mustang is currently escaping in an ice cream truck!
Barricade the main roads!
The truck may look normal,but it's filled with weapons and ammo!
Don't let your guard down!
A-A bear!
A bear with a mohawk!
Signal lost.
A bear with a mohawk...?
Captain Buccaneer from the Northern Army.
Colonel, it seems like it'll be difficult to enter the city.
Yeah.
An ice cream truck, huh...?
I wonder if they're doing well.
But it's irritating that I can't fight alongside them.
I never knew how annoying it can be to wait.
I've been hearing this sound since yesterday.
Hey Alphonse, what is that sound?
Selim's playing with my head.
He may be a monster on the inside, but I guess he's still a brat.
Make him stop, Alphonse!
Make him stop those noises!
It's morse code!
Signals the army uses for communication!
He's telling someone our current location-
Hi.
Thanks for coming to pick me up, Kimblee.
Seriously... please stop giving me extra work.
Come on, give me a break.
I won't let my guard down again.
W-What are these things?!
You tricked me, Envy!
D-Did not!
Immortality is just beyond-
Oww!
Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!
You bitch!!
Yes!!
Guess who's back?!
Thanks for bringing me here, little brat.
Why are there soldiers here?
Are they here to make us leave?
Oh no... there's nowhere else to go.
W-What's this all about?
Don't tell me they've found out where we're hiding...
Oh no, Alphonse!
Hang on, Doctor!
What if they found out you're Doctor Marcoh?!
But I can't just sit back and watch...
Take a moment to calm down.
If you were to be taken hostage,it would only hurt Alphonse and the others.
It's dangerous to just move around without thinking.
Let's stay put.
Yeah? Yeah?
Are you alone?
I heard that Gluttony was here with you.
I made use of him.
You ate him?
Your own comrade?
Not a comrade. We're part of the same being.
We were born from the same father.
Think of it as "coming back together", per se.
I see.
Mr. Heinkel!
Wow, you're still alive?
Can't underestimate a chimera's survival power, after all.
Mr. Heinkel!
Dammit!
Let go!
I won't let you get away.
You-
Don't know when to give up, do you.
Stop running away.
What?
I knew it wouldn't work.
That's as far as you're going to get,Major General Armstrong!
A shoot-on-sight order has been issued for your treason!
Ready!
Fire!
Idiot.
Placing your men in this situation is just foolish.
Here's to hoping that did 
I've got you now.
Didn't get the wrong one this time.
Female general...
...must die.
Sister!!
Are you all right?!
Who are you even talking to, Alex?!
Glad to see you're safe.
And so, what is that thing?
A homunculus.
A bullet isn't enough to even move him an inch.
Maybe a little budge with a cannon.
Oh, my!
This is my specialty!
Please let your brother, Alex, handle this!
Come, monster!
Such a drag...
Don't mind me...
Hurry up... and escape...
No!
Don't be stupid.
At this rate, neither of us will make it.
If you leave me behind, at least you may be able to survive.
I said, no!
Focus on living for now!
Idiot!
Take a good look at reality.
We're put against Kimblee and Pride.
Just leave me behind...!
Don't give up!
I'll save you for sure!
Dammit...!
Move, stupid leg!
We can't lose here!
Mr. Heinkel, hang onto me!
Don't you dare give up!
You siblings are so...
Why do you try to save otherswhen you're all damaged as well?
I made a promise.
I made a promise with Brother,
that we won't let anyone die again.
You're right.
I recall even Kimblee saying that "if you survive, you win."
Thanks to that, I remembered that I had something good with me.
Why do you have this?
I picked it up at the mines to the north after being abandoned by Kimblee...
A philosopher's stone...
We really may be able to beat them if we have this.
But still!
Yeah, I know.
This is made of human lives, right?
I've heard from your brother that you guys don't want to use this to return to your bodies.
In that case...
In that case, use them to save the world; not for yourselves.
I'm asking you because you're willing to acknowledge them as human lives,
even after being reduced to such a state.
I can understand their feelings.
No matter what they may look like now, they still want to fight to protect what's precious to them.
Give them a chance to fight too.
Okay.
Give them a good beatdown,
Alphonse.
Yeah.
Let's fight them together.
This cloud of dust is annoying.
Should I blow it away with an explosion?
No,
they're both still inside it.
Besides, he won't be able to escape without his legs-
Oh, my.
Instead of escaping, you...
Marvelous.
Very entertaining, Alphonse Elric!
































If it's a fight between man and man, choose the path you believe is right.
Only a fool would stand indecisive after being frightened at the thought of being soiled by the mud.

I don't need your help!
Shut up!
Your arm hasn't even fully recovered yet, right?!
So what?!
Just worry about yourself for now.
I'm going to need your help later, you know.
Keep going!
Sorry, I couldn't finish him.
Heh, don't worry about it.
I can't blame you for not being able to beat him.
Even from my perspective, he's a monster.
Wake up!
Alphonse!
Huh?
Dad?
Yo.
So...
If you're here...
Am I in Kanama?
Yup.
Why am I...
Since when...
I remember now! Pride!
Dad, the homunculus Pride was inside me!
Yeah, I heard everything from Mr. Gorrilius.
It's Darius.
Drats...
It felt so disgusting. It was as if he was interfering with my soul.
They're like the alter ego of my alter ego.
Since you're my son, it's probably easier for them to interfere with your soul through the blood seal.
Old Man Fu!
Please treat his injuries.
How are things going over there?
Are you Edward's father?
Yeah.
The shadowy monster devoured Gluttony, and we hardly stand a chance.
Greed and Edward are fighting him, but things aren't looking too good.
It's all my fault...
Everyone's in danger because I was captured by Pride...
There's an unlimited source of light due to the fire, and I've already used up all of my flash bangs.
We can't use that same trick again.
This isn't good.
At this rate, the people living in the slums will be dragged into it as well.
Dad.
You're a skilled alchemist, right?
Of course.
You'd be amazed.
There's something I'd like to ask of you, considering your skill.
Well then...
The view is pretty clear now.
No use in taking cover.
You can't escape from my nose.
Dammit...!
Hey, you alive?!
More or less...
Should you really be worrying about others right now, Greed?
I wonder how much more you can take at this point.
You monster.
A rather rude way to address your sibling, don't you think?
Mind if I eat you?
Eat me and you'll have a stomachache, Big Bro.
Oh? Finally decided to show yourself?
Hohenheim.
Heroes are supposed to show up late.
Heroes?
So you think you're able to defeat me?
Nah, that's impossible.
You're pretty scary, after all.
What is he planning?
Is he aiming for something?
He's coming!
Wow, what a disappointing strategy.
You just don't know when to give up!
Al!
So he came back, just to be taken hostage again?
Your son is quite the odd one.
Don't you dare...
...to make fun of my son.
Hohenheim!!!
Amazing...!
He actually sealed him in.
What's the big idea?!
You got Al stuck in there too!
What the hell were you thinking?!
It wasn't my idea.
It was Al's.
It worked!
You can't use your ability in here.
Is that really a cause for celebration?
You can't escape either.
If you crack open an exit to leave even for an instant...
...I'll use my shadow and-
I don't have the slightest intention of getting out of here.
Why don't we engage in a test of wills, Selim?
No, homunculus Pride.
My body doesn't require oxygen, light, or even food.
You're going to quietly sit here with me for the entire day,
until the Promised Day comes to an end.
Defeating Pride in his current state would be difficult.
And if we were to let him run loose,it would cause massive damage to the surroundings.
That's why Al offered to use himself as a decoy to trap him without engaging in combat.
With this, we've gained some time to work out a plan.
But you guys didn't even discuss it with me-
He said,
"If I were to tell Brother, he'd definitely be against it."
He did the best he could to think of a way that would keep everyone alive.
Don't get mad at him.
Okay, let's start with putting this fire out.
Al!
Brother!
Al!
Sorry for doing this just after we were reunited.
But I had to, because I was the one who caused this mess.
And besides, I only have to be in here for a day.
I'll be fine, Brother.
Lust is gone, Envy is gone, and Gluttony now, too.
Wrath is at the the joint exercise in the east,
and Pride can't move right now.
The only ones left at Central right now are Father and Sloth.
Greed! What the hell are you thinking?!
Told you earlier, didn't I?
I'm going to become the king of the world.
Don't you think there's been a lot of Ishbalans in Central lately?
Yeah, man.
I heard there's a group of them near the abandoned building to the west.
Speaking of Ishbalans...
Remember the lad with the cross-shaped scar who used to live here?
I wonder how he's doing.
Yo, speak of the devil!
We were just talking about you!
I'm looking for a slum by the name of Kanama.
Kanama is located on the edge of town,in the forest to the south.
I see. Thanks.
Oh yeah, isn't the little girl with you?
You know, the one who wascarrying around a black and white cat.
She actually came back here a little while ago.
What?!
She didn't go back to her country?
What is she up to?
You guys finally did it!
What are you talking about?
You guys were the ones behind it, right?
The ones who blew up Bradley in his train in the east.
Blew up?!
Huh? Was I wrong?
This is news to us.
Well, I figured you teamed upwith the other Ishbalans and did it.
Well, everyone was saying thatthey were going to commit terrorism.
They didn't gather here to do such a thing.
They're good friends of ours who seek to change this country in a method other than terrorism.
I should stop being so enthusiastic about my work.
Because of that, I've soiled my new suit.
The real performance starts after daybreak.
It's useless.
There's no way my dad would make it so easy for a child to be able to break through.
This is what happens when you make fun of humans so much.
You guys don't know anything about us.
You shouldn't think that everything will go your way.
Same with that scheme.
From my perspective, it's just careless planning.
Careless?
That's right.
You call us human sacrifices,
and it seems as though you're planning on using us to accomplish something...
What if we were to escape outside the country for the fear of our own safety?
At that point, your plan would have been completely ruined.
As you say, there are humans who believe that their safety comes first.
However...
Yes, for example, Wrath's wife.
There once was a time when I was about to be hit by a car in town.
She tried to save me, ready to sacrifice her own life.
Though she doesn't know I'm a homunculus,
I was completely taken aback by her desperate action.
I've always had a father, but never a mother.
That's why, to be honest, her existence was fascinating.
I began to wonder whether that's what having a mother was like.
Wrath's wife...
Madam Bradley, right?
That's right.
I can't believe how low you are to deceive such a kind soul...
You're right. It 
But it was fun living with her,
and I do love her.
Then-
There are...
There are humans, like Wrath's wife, who would throw away their own life to protect something dear to them.
And those of you who were chosen to be human sacrifices,
possess a strong heart, even out of those people.
There's no way you'd throw away this country and flee.
For instance, you came back here to fight.
There's not a hint of carelessness in our plan.
Colonel.
It's almost time.
Right.
Let's go, Lieutenant.
What in the name of...
What happened here?
And what is this mound?
Well, if it isn't Jerso and Zampano!
Darius!
D-Don't tell me Kimblee sent you here to eliminate us?
Huh?
What are you, high?
I stopped working for Kimblee months ago.
You're just saying that to get us off guard, and then you're planning to kill us!
I'm not!
I can't trust you!
Heinkel's probably hiding somewhere over there, ready to ambush us.
Quit being so insistent, idiot!
Doctor Marcoh!
What did you just call me?!
You want to fight, Porky Pig?!
Edward.
That's Zampano!
You-
So Scar was with you guys.
What are you saying?!
The gorilla said it!
Sorry to rush you when you just arrived, but we should make arrangements asap-
Hey!
Why can't pigs, fatties and gorillas learn to get along?!
Are you picking a fight, punk?!
Oh, so you guys really did stop working for Kimblee.
If we kept working for him, he'd just dispose of us.
Definitely.
Well thanks to that, we're fugitives now,
but it does feel nice.
Yeah.
Also,
those guys definitely won't abandon us.
It'll finally begin once the sun comes up.
Yeah.
I hope we'll all live to see the next day.
Looks like they've come to terms.
Where did the old man run off to?
He went to go scout out the town.
Alone?
Yeah.
He said that it would end up being more convenient,
since he's the only one whose face hasn't been seen by the enemy.
He said he'd go and check up on a couple of things, such as Colonel Mustang's movements,
but for the most part, I think he's worried about the whereabouts of Ling.
Ah, makes sense.
Are you done making arrangements with Scar and them?
Yeah.
The plan has been decided.
I see.
So it's time at last.
Your brother is pretty gutsy.
He's trapped in there with that monster in pitch darkness, after all.
If it were me, I would have gone crazy by now.
Yeah.
Al's giving it his all.
Now, the rest...
...is up to us!
The Promised Day...
...is here!






























Denny! Denny!
Hey, Denny!
Shut up...
What do you want?
You need to wake up!
Or else it'll begin!
What'll begin?
The solar eclipse!
Solar eclipse?
Geez... what time do you think it is?
It's way too early for the solar eclipse to begin.
H-Hey! Don't look at the sun with that!
You'll go blind!
I know that.
Come here, Brother!
There's smoke rising from town!
Don't leave the house today, got it?!
Cedi Squad in the western district reporting.We've discovered Mustang and his men in District C75.
We're currently engaging.
However, they have the FÃ¼hrer President's wife as hostage,
and it's very difficult for us to attack...
I don't care. Attack.
Huh?
As long as Roy Mustang stays alive, it's fine.
The woman means nothing to us.
Have her killed along with Mustang's men.
Freeze!
Will you shoot?
Shoot everyone except for Colonel Mustang!
The peace-accustomed masses are oblivious to the crisis right before their eyes.
They can't even begin to imagine the destruction awaiting them.
Next time, Fullmetal Alchemist:
Episode 50, A Disturbance in Central.
The weak reel in loss, and the strong trample them down.
That is war.It's that expression again, May.
Yeah, that also represents gold.
What are you two doing?
We're checking to see whether there's a hidden message here.
A hidden message?
Alchemists often hide their research using trope and hidden meanings to prevent ordinary people from deciphering it.
But at a glance, these documents aren't encrypted.
So we're going to note that phrases with "immortality" and "gold" appear quite often to try to view things differently.
Think you're on to something then?
Not at all.
Where am I?
Al!
Sir Al!
I'm so glad!
I was worried you'd never wake up!
Sorry for worrying all of you.
So, why am I in pieces?
And that's where we're at now.
You were too large to carry.
That is why we had to take you apart.
Sorry to give you guys so much trouble.
Has this ever happened before?
Just once, while I was on my way here.
It must be inconvenient for you to be scattered in pieces.
Let's put you back together.
Thanks, I appreciate it.
Could you hold on to this for a second?
Let's see...
This is...
I think that's his right arm.
Ah, you're right. We have to put him back together properly.
Scattered in pieces...
Putting things together...
Hey, May?!
Look at what you've done!
They're all scattered now!
I was wondering...
...how it would look if we changed the pages' order by grouping terms such as "gold" and "immortality".
"Golden Being"... I saw that term over there.
"Immortality"... overlaps with these right here.
"Perfect Being"...
Ah, I found it!
Hand me those pages, Marcoh.
Oh, that ties into these!
Does anyone have a "Golden Being"?
I do. It's right here.
That should be the last of them.
Could it be...
This is...
The Nationwide Transmutation Circle...
Even if we find out about this now...
What does this mean?
Do you mean these research documents won't be of any use at all?!
You've gotta be kidding me!
What's going to happen to us-
No...
What's going to happen to this country?!
I apologize...
I was foolish to hope someone else's studies would overturn this crisis.
Brother, is this what you wanted to tell me?
Knowing you, shouldn't you have gotten further than this?
There's still something else.
We didn't even realize to take it apart at first.
It wouldn't be strange if there was more hidden in these documents!
Yeah.
Idiot! What were you thinking?!
It's Mother Nature's fault for making it so cold.
Besides, I'm sensitive to the cold!
So what?!
Now we don't know front from back!
Look at all these you flipped over!
That may be it!
We need to "overturn" this crisis!
Flip each one of them over from how they were originally!
Well?
Bingo.
This is a new Amestrian Nationwide Transmutation Circle that is activated when Eastern Alchemy is made a part of it.
Episode 42, Sign of a Counterattack.
I don't see any signs of them going this way.
Perhaps I took a wrong turn somewhere. I guess I'll go back.
I see.
So this place is used to remove the rubble from the tunnel Sloth is digging.
You're the Crimson Alchemist, correct?
Pleasure to meet you. I'm Pride.
Can I help you?
What happened with Scar?
I'm currently after him.
Save that for later.
First, carve a bloody crest into Briggs.
With all due respect, the soldiers at Briggs are quite monolithic and powerful.
It won't be that easy.
You need to utilize that exact strength.
The tunnel being dug by Sloth is almost complete.
I understand.
As you say, I'll carve a bloody crest.
To the Briggs fortress.
We've been waiting for you!
Any changes?
Nothing in particular.
Moving right on, I heard Kimblee has gone missing. Is this true?
Yes.
There was an explosion large enough to cause a shaft to collapse.
Kimblee and a few others are missing.
We searched the rubble, but in the end, found no bodies.
Are the "few others" soldiers from Briggs?
No.
Two of Kimblee's men...
...and the Fullmetal Alchemist.
Oh. The Fullmetal boss, eh?
I hope he's okay.
As do I.
How are things in the west?
Things are getting nasty on the Pendleton border.
From their way of fighting, I can't help but think they're 
As you said, it seems like the army is taking the initiative in causing bloodshed to create a transmutation circle.
Have you gotten word fromMaster Sergeant Fuery in the south?
He called me a little while ago.
He says they're having an all-out war with the Aerugon army in South Fotsett.
R... Run, Thomas!
No time to rest!
Thoma-
Dammit!
I will survive!
God dammit, I 
I see.
After all, we, members of Mustang's old team, aren't so popular.
Have you been in contact with the Colonel?
Yes, in full detail. We've been using a messenger who's acquainted with the Armstrong family.
Roger that.
Things seem to be getting pretty serious up north, so be careful.
Serious sounds about right.
The underlings of the man who's planning to turn this country into Hell are proceeding steadily with their plan,
but there's not a single thing we can do about it.
It's connected.
I don't have to work anymore... right... Pride?
The time is near.
The day is right within our reach.
Guys!
Lunch is served! Please line up!
Hey Rose, I'd like to have meat pie next time.
We'll make some if we get the ingredients.
I'll be looking forward to it!
I don't work here, but do you think you could possibly give these two something to eat?
Why not?
There's plenty for you, too, madam.
This looks so good!
Can I get an extra scoop, Rose?
Sorry, everyone gets the same amount.
Excuse me...
C-Can I have some, as well?
You saved me!
Thank you so much. It was great.
Where did you come from?
That's a difficult question to answer,since I've been wandering all over the place.
But why Liore of all places?
You've heard of the riot that happened here, right?
There's nothing left in this town because of it.
There are delicious meals here, are there not?
I'm flattered by your compliment,
but this is about all I can do to help.
That's not true.
Both the warm meals you serve and the bright smile on your face motivate everyone to work.
That's right.
I know you just saved my life,but I'm actually looking for a church.
A church?
Yeah. The headquarters of the Leto religion, the cause of the riot.
It's just as you see.
Even if you go in, there won't be anything left.
Is there a passage that leads underground?
Y-Yes, there is, but...
What's this?
A poisoned reservoir.
It was already like that when we found it.
So an ordinary human won't be able to get past this.
Let's see.
Wait!
You'll die if you step in it!
A miracle...
You mean... alchemy...
I'm going to go a bit further,so could you wait for me here?
Wow...
This place is huge.
Damn him, making something so large.
That was quick.
Uh oh, that wasn't even enough to slow you down.
In that case...
Why don't I trap you?!
Uh oh...
This isn't good...
What's wrong? Aren't you going to kill me?
Hmm?
You... You're Van Hohenheim, aren't you?
Looks like this is as far as you can go.
You'll die if you go any further?
Going past this line will result in your death, right?
Kind of like that flask.
So, my conclusion is you can only move within this tunnel and in the center portion of Central.
What do you say?
Am I right?
What's wrong? Why don't you say something, Mr. Can't-Leave-His-Home?!
You mad?
There's no such thing as wrath within me.
Not just wrath.
I left all of my unnecessary emotions within Father.
My name is Pride.
Pride...
I see, so that stands for "avarice".
They say man is embodied by seven deadly sins.
Lust.
Greed.
Sloth.
Gluttony.
Envy.
Wrath.
And... Pride.
So the emotion he let go of first was you. "Pride".
Funny how he detached you to look exactly as he did when he was in the flask.
So that appearance itself is the true nature of that arrogant, self-adulating father of yours.
I'm going to ask that you visit my father.
Hey, no need to rush things.
Don't worry; I'd visit him even if I weren't invited.
Tell him this:
"Slave Number 23 will be coming to see you soon."
"Throw yourself back in your chair in Central while you wait for him."
Got it?
Sure, I'll be waiting for you.
Van Hohenheim.
He's back.
Find anything?
Yeah...
People shouldn't go near this place. It's dangerous.
Please tell everyone not to go in.
What were you doing down there?
Just a little declaration of war.
Your shift is up.
Finally! The blizzard was killing me!
I guess I'll go have a cup of bad coffee.
Good work.
H-Hey!
Don't tell me that's...
The Drachman army?!
Drachma to the north has declared open hostilities!
All men, battle positions!
I repeat!
Drachma to the north has declared open hostilities!
All men, battle positions!
We're lucky the Northern Wall of Briggs isn't around.
Right, Sir Kimblee?
Additionally, there are many men loyal to me in the fort.
Once the battle begins, they'll betray the others, causing the fort to be thrown into confusion.
At last, I shall take Briggs by storm.
The fort that has stood in the way of Drachma for eternity!
It's time for the declaration of war.
Let's launch some fireworks, shall we?!
All cannons at the ready!
Fire!!!
Yeah, that's right. My name is Zampano.
One of Kimblee's men.
Doctor Marcoh is currently hiding in the slums of Asbec.
I appreciate you telling us, Zampano.
We'll guarantee your safety.
Marcoh!
Things are getting interesting!
Wily souls bring about a catastrophe,
and the pride making the decision gets hurt in the process.
But it's inevitable in the process of rebirth.
Next time, Fullmetal Alchemist:
Episode 43, An Ant's Bite.
The snowfield is dyed red.
The color of blood that was shed to protect.One human only has the power to do so much.
That's why I'm going to protect...
...even if it's just a handful of them...
...the ones most important to me.
A subordinate protects their subordinate, and so forth.
That should be possible, even for us puny humans.
Geometric progression?
Which means this.
If you want to protect this whole country,
you have to be at the top of the summit.
It must feel great up there, Hughes.
But I can't climb to the top with my own strength.
I'm sure of it.
What are you getting all worked up for?
Sounds interesting.
I'm in.
I want to see what kind of changesyour naive ideals will bring to this country.
Colonel...
Colonel.
Why not head to the nap room if you're tired?
Yeah... sorry.
I wanted to finish up the documents I've started before I get transferred to Central.
I haven't slept much lately.
It seemed you were dreaming about something.
What? Just a boring flashback.
Episode 10, Separate Ways.
I don't remember anything after being kicked by this guy.
"Guardians with only souls","precious sacrifices", "being kept alive".
"Tattoo of Ouroboros", and"transmutation circle for a philosopher's stone".
According to Dr. Marcoh,the stones were used in Ishbal, as well...
There are too many mysteries for it to be an ordinary experiment.
I'd like to look into it some more,but the research lab is in ruins now.
Hmm...
Seems like they're discussing something tricky...
I don't feel like getting involved in something dangerous again, so I refuse to listen!
Hey, you two...
Is this the Fullmetal Alchemist's recovery room?
Yes, he's in here...
We may be able to discover something if we look through the court-martial chamber.
I'll go and investigate the ones who were participating in the research of the stones under Dr. Marcoh.
Sorry to intrude.
F-FÃ¼hrer-President... King Bradley!
Quiet down. You can be at ease.
Your Excellency, may I ask why you are here?
Why I'm here?
To visit this boy, of course.
Are you fond of melon at all?
Oh... thank you.
Wait, something's wrong here!
Seems like you've been doing a lot of investigating of the military leadership, Major Armstrong.
Huh?! Well... that's...
How did you...
Don't underestimate my intelligence network.
And you, Edward Elric...
The philosopher's stone, right?
Just how much did you find out?Depending on that, I may have to...
I'm joking!
No need to get tense.
What?
I, too, was aware there have beendisquieting activities within the military.
I've always wanted to do something about them, but...
Oh, that's...
A list of people who were researching the philosopher's stones, eh?
Every one of them has been reported missing.
What?!
They have been reported missing a few days prior to the destruction of Research Laboratory 5.
The enemy is always ahead of us.
Even with my intelligence network,we still don't know the scale of it all,
their objectives, or how close they are to achieving them.
So you're saying it's extremely dangerous for us to look into it.
That's right.
Lt. Colonel Hughes,
Major Armstrong,
Elric Brothers,
I've decided you all are trustworthy people.
I forbid you to continue investigating this matter or to disclose it to others!
You cannot trust anyone in a situation like this,when you cannot even distinguish friend from foe!
Regard all of the military as your foe and proceed carefully!
However...
When the time comes, I will have many tasks for all of you.
So be prepared.
Yes, sir!
Your Excellency!
Where have you gone, Your Excellency?!
Ah, drats! Here comes my annoying subordinate.
I snuck out of my office, after all.
Farewell!
Hey, Ed.
Huh?
What are you guys doing?
Let's just say... a storm just went by.
I went out and bought the tickets you asked for.
Tomorrow's afternoon train, right?
Yeah, thanks.
Why are you in such a rush?Your wounds haven't even healed yet.
I can't stay in a place reeking of antiseptics like this forever.
Where are you going this time?
Dublith?
Yeah.
After discussing it with Al, we decided to stop by our master's place.
I'm scared, Brother...
We're probably going to get killed!
C-Courage, my little brother!
I'm just as scared as you are!
What kind of person is your master...
Dublith is quite far from here.
Where is it?
Let's see... It's here. It's right in the middle of the South.
W-What?!
This place! Before Dublith!
The Holy Land of Automails, Rush Valley!
I've always wanted to go there!
Please take me! Please take me!
Take me! You better take me!
Why don't you go by yourself?
Who's going to pay for the trip, then?
You're planning on making 
Sure, why not? It's on the way, after all.
I guess it's okay...
Hooray!
I'm going to give Granny a call!
Yeah, she'll make a grand wife.
Don't tell 
Not as grand as my wife, though!
Well, Papa's going to be on his way!
Are you going to come home early today, Papa?
Hmm, I wonder?
Papa's got a lot of work to do!
But I'll come home as soon as I can!
You're going to be late.
You're going to be leaving today, right, Winry?
I can't see you off because of work, so...
Take care of yourself.
I'm truly indebted to you, Mr. Hughes.
Be sure to drop by if you ever come to Central again.
Think of it as your home.
And give my regards to those boys, too.
Okay!
Good luck at work, Papa!
See you!
Why did you decide to go visit your master all of a sudden?
Two reasons.
First off, we've kind of been on a losing streak.
What?!
You're going because you want to get stronger?!
What are you guys, muscleheads?
Idiot! It's not that simple!
We don't just want to get stronger physically, but should we say mentally, too...
Right?
Yeah.
Anyway, we feel like we'll be able to get stronger if we visit our master.
I want to become far stronger than I am now.
And your second reason?
I want to ask about philosopher's stones.
The real truth that is beyond truth...
We never found out the meaning of those words, after all.
Our master might know something about it.
We can't be caring about how we're going to look out there.
We're going to ask our master while being prepared to be killed...
Ask...
Ask...
It was a short-lived life.
I wish I could have had a girlfriend, at least...
What kind of person is your master?
A riot in Liore?
Yes.
Apparently, the riot caused by some Leto cultdeceiving the citizens has finally calmed down.
I see...
With Ishbal and other riots...the East sure have their hands full.
Not just the East, but there are riots and border warssparking up in the North and the West.
Mountains of corpses everywhere, huh...
We may even get a coup soon...
Where are you headed, Lt. Colonel?
To the library.
Riots throughout Liore.
The ingredients of philosopher's stones are humans...
What we did in Ishbal...
Whoa now, who's the mastermind behind all of this?
I've got to hurry and let the FÃ¼hrer-President know...
Nice to meet you, Lt. Colonel Hughes.
Or should I say... farewell?
Cool tattoo you've got there.
You found out too much, Lt. Colonel Hughes.
Dammit...
That's something 
Oh, Lt. Colonel Hughes.
If you're here to call someone about your family again-
Lt. Colonel, you're bleeding!
It's nothing. I need to use the phone...
I need to call the FÃ¼hrer-President building...
Sorry to bother you...
Lt. Colonel!
Hello? You've reached Eastern Headquarters.
Let me talk to Roy... Colonel Roy Mustang.
We're not permitted to relay direct calls from an outside line.
I'm Lt. Colonel Hughes from Central!
I'm calling from a phone booth because of an emergency!
Please give me the code.
What a bother!
Uncle-Sugar-Oliver-Eight-Zero-Zero!
I've verified the code.
One moment, please.
Hurry up!
The military is in danger!
Could you put down the receiver, Lt. Colonel?
The receiver, please.
2nd Lt. Ross... or not.
Who are you?
I'm 2nd Lt. Maria Ross. Have you forgotten?
No, you're not.
2nd Lt. Ross has a mole under her left eye!
Huh? Really?
I was careless.
How's this?
What the hell...
It's as if I'm dreaming.
Your quick-wittedness brought the end of you, Lt. Colonel Hughes.
Hey now, give me a break.
I've got a wife and a daughter waiting for me at home.
There's no way...
...I can die here!
Perfect staging, right?
Damn you!!!
Lt. Colonel Hughes from Central is on a public line.
Again?
Put him through.
It's me.
If it's about your daughter again, I'm hanging up.
Hughes?
Hughes...
Hey, Hughes!
Humans are so foolish.
Risking their lives for something so stupid.
Elicia... Gracia...
I'm sorry...
I don't think I can... keep my promise...
Wow, this is delicious!
These apple pies are awesome!
Miss Gracia is such a good cook!
I know that.
The quiche she made for us once was really good.
It's on my "list of things to eat when I get my body back".
She taught me how to make it, so I'll bake one for you when you get your body back, Al.
Yay!
Mr. Hughes and Miss Gracia are both wonderful people.
Lt. Colonel Hughes is such a doting father...and kind of annoying because he's so meddlesome.
He always came to poke fun at you in your hospital room, didn't he?
Seriously.
He's always saying he's busy with work, yet he paid me a visit every day.
We have to thank him next time.
Yeah.
Mama... why are they burying Papa?
Elicia...
Papa won't be able to go to work if they do that.
Elici...
Papa said he had a lot of work to do!
Stop!
Don't bury him!
Papa!!!
Specially promoted two ranks after being killed in the line of duty.
Brigadier General Hughes... huh?
You said you were going to work under me and support me.
What's the point if you surpass my rank?
Idiot...
Colonel.
Alchemists are unpleasant creatures, aren't they, Lieutenant?
I'm desperately putting together the theory of human transmutation in my head.
I feel like I know how those boys felt when they tried to transmute their mother.
Are you all right?
Yeah.
Ah, it looks like it's beginning to rain.
No, I don't think so...
No, it's raining all right.
You're right.
Let's go back.
We'll catch colds.
He left the room saying thathe was going to go to the library.
That was the last I saw of the Lt. Colonel.
Did he fight with someone in here?
Most likely.
There were bloodstains from the room to the hallway.
And his next destination was...
Lt. Colonel tried to make a phone call,even while he was injured...
But... he left without doing so.
He realized something in the court-martial chamber...
...and took the trouble to contact me from the outside when he could have called from within the building.
The telephone operator in the Eastern Headquarters heard Hughes say, "The military is in danger".
What is it?
What was he trying to tell me?
Colonel, I've brought Major Armstrong.
We have an idea of the ones who murdered Lt. Colonel Hughes.
Then why don't you take them into custody?!
We have an idea, but we don't know exactly who they are.
What do you mean? Tell me in detail.
I cannot.
I, a Colonel, am telling you to speak.
Are you going to disobey a senior officer?!
I cannot speak.
Understood.
Sorry for calling you out here.
You may go.
Yes, sir.
Sir, I forgot to mention.
The Elric Brothers had been staying here until a few days ago.
The Elric Brothers?
Yes, the Elric Brothers.
Did they find what they were looking for?
No.
What they are looking for is almost legendary.
I see. Thanks.
We couldn't get much out of him, could we?
Seriously...
The Major is truly good-natured.
He said specifically,"ones who murdered Lt. Colonel Hughes".
Which means there were several.
It could be that they're working as an organization.
If he can't speak, even under order from a colonel,
that means someone higher ranked than me is imposing silence on him.
We can assume the top of the military is behind it.
And the thing the Elric Brothers are looking for...
In other words, the philosopher's stone.
An organization that has a hand in the military leadership, the philosopher's stone, and Lt. Colonel Hughes...
Just how does it all relate...
As for now, we don't know.
But once I get transferred to Central, I'll investigate the leadership and find out who killed Hughes.
It's unlike you to mix up private and public matters.
There are no "private" or "public" matters involved.
Aiming to become FÃ¼hrer-President and avenging Hughes' death...
...are both my will as an individual.
Our target will be the military leadership. You're coming with me, right?
Like I'll back down now.
Ed and Al run through Rush Valley, chasing after Paninya, a girl who stole Ed's silver pocket watch,
although they have no idea what's awaiting them.
Next time, Fullmetal Alchemist:
Episode 11, The Miracle at Rush Valley.
The words the boy engraved were words of resolve.
Or could they be...Do you remember the first time we met, Kimblee?
It seems our positions are now reversed!
Don't you dare look down on me!
Episode 39, Daydream.
Kimblee, you bastard!
Why... Why is Winry here?!
We were just about to capture Scar, but now he's taken her hostage!
Move.
Idiot!
Stop, Crimson Alchemist!
Do you not see Winry in front of you?!
Don't get in my way!
Hold it, Scar!
Sir Kimblee, don't go near the building! It's dangerous!
Withdraw!
There's a blizzard approaching! Hurry!
You're a fantastic actor.
That wasn't an act.
I'm actually furious at myself for being such a coward and having to put up such an act.
Why did you kill my parents? 
No matter what I say, it'll be only an excuse. 
The fact is I killed the Rockbells. 
With this hand...
Girl, you have the right to kill me.
At this rate, you'll die from blood loss.
Winry!
I know.
But I'm sure Mom and Dad would have done the same.
It's a life Mom and Dad saved.
I'm sure there's a meaning to it.
You're saying you'll forgive me?
Don't get the wrong idea! I haven't forgiven you for killing my parents unjustly!
Winry...
Don't worry; I'm not going to cry.
Didn't I promise you that the next time I cry, it'd be with tears of joy?
Hey, Scar.
Despite what Winry just said, I still want to beat you to a pulp and drag you over to the Rockbells' graves.
Should I contact Headquarters?
Yeah.
I believe Miles was your name?
Can I ask something?
What is it?
You called me a fellow countryman, didn't you?
I did.
Until my grandfather's generation, my ancestors were full Ishbalans.
I wish we could have met under different circumstances, my red-eyed brethren.
Why are you siding with the Amestrian army?
Because I wish to change the way people feel about Ishbalans from within the country.
I doubt people would change the way they feel so easily.
I don't know how long it'll take.
But there are things only I,a man of mixed parentage, can do.
I'm nothing but an Ishbalan pebble that was thrown into the Amestrian army.
But there may come a time whena small ripple becomes a giant wave.
And ironically, the person who made me realize that is a full-blooded Amestrian.
I'm nothing but a mass of hatred, born from that civil war.
I'm glad someone like you exists.
Major.
Is this Headquarters?
This is Miles speaking.
We've captured Scar in a building in Area D.
Let Kimblee know.
No matter what your circumstances are,I can't just let you go.
You deserve to be tried and sentenced.
Wait!
Who are you?!
May!
Doctor Marcoh!
Please don't take that man away.
This is bad, Sir Kimblee.
The clouds are moving fast.The weather's about to get pretty ugly.
Then let's hurry.
Deciphering research documents?
It's breakthrough research that combines the alchemies from Amestris and Xing!
But the essential portions are written in ancient Ishbalan.
The only one who can read this is Scar.
So...
You're the girl who knows Eastern Alchemy, right?
I've received orders to take you back to the fort.
Huh?! M-Me?
Don't worry.
I've been ordered to give you a warm reception.
Now... if Scar can't be caught...
...and if we also can't let them know that Marcoh is here...
It might be better to just hide them at Briggs for now.
Hang on, what the hell?!
You're taking 
Don't you guys need him to decipher the documents?
It pisses me off to think we have to ask 
Why don't we just hand him over to Kimblee and-
A transmutation circle made from this country.
And the history of this country.
I've heard everything from General Armstrong.
Something is about to happen;something that will encompass all of Amestris.
Isn't deciphering the documents of higher priority than anything else?
I'm also aware that Ms. Rockbell has been taken hostage.
If we do this now, we could make Kimblee take the blame and hide her away at the same time.
Scar, if you decide to lend us a hand,we can postpone your trial to a later date.
What do you say?
I have no other options, do I?
I promise to cooperate.
Do you really mean it?
I swear on my Ishbalan blood, my red-eyed brethren.
So, that's how it is.
I'm sorry, but you're going to have to wait a little longer for him to face trial.
That's fine.
Oh yeah, I forgot about these two.
Kill them.
Roger.
H-Hey!
Hang on! You don't have to kill them!
There's nothing to be gained from letting them live.
Do it.
This isn't about gain or loss! Isn't there something you could do besides killing them?!
Showing us pity, huh?
There's no need for that. You're just a kid who doesn't know anything.
There's no future for us anyway, since we've got bodies like these.
If you're going to kill us, just do it.
Don't you two have family or people important to you?
Of course we do.
But when we were transformed to this state, we were publicly pronounced dead.
I haven't seen them since.
Don't you 
Even if we did, there's nothing we could do. Look at us.
Oh, so you don't want to return to your old selves?
You're fine with those bodies, then?
Of course not!
Of course we want to return to normal!
Then there's your answer.
Please don't talk as though you've already given up.
You haven't even explored the possibility of returning to your old bodies.
How the hell would 
There's no way to-
I'm going to get my body back.
No matter how many years it may take, I'll never give up!
Major!
What is it?
This isn't good.
A blizzard is approaching.
It's impossible to march in a blizzard with the equipment we have right now.
At this rate, we won't make it back to the fort.
What should we do?
Isn't this a mining town?
Why don't we just take the underground mining path?
Wh-What?!
I-It's just that since this is such a big mine, I figured there might be a path leading through the mountain...
I-I think...
That's it!
Sir Yoki!
I used to own a coal mine, after all!
That would work! The mine exits beyond the mountain.
Okay.
If you happen to encounter a soldier from Briggs, hand them this.
I've stated the situation in there, so they should give you refuge.
I'm in your debt.
I guess the only thing we still have to account for is the girl.
Even if she comes with us, wouldn't the Elric Brothers be the prime suspects if they find out she's missing?
We'll figure something out.
Don't mean to brag, but we can work as well as we can talk.
No, Kimblee is a very suspicious man.
If we don't plan this completely, he'll be doubly suspicious.
Umm... this may be a bit strange coming from me...
But...
What if I were kidnapped by Scar?
"Kidnapped"?
So... what you mean is...
We free him, and...
Yeah. Scar runs off with me in his arms, and you pretend like you're desperately trying to stop him...
...or something like that.
Do you think we'll let you do something that dangerous?!
I'm a hostage right now, anyway!
I have to risk my life to escape, or it'll never happen!
But with Scar?!
Yeah! You don't need to risk 
Quit trying to do everything by yourselves! I'm tired of it!
Hurry up and decide. The blizzard is coming.
Pretty soon, we won't even be able to leave this building.
Kimblee's squad is here!
Dammit!
Scar, if anything happens...
I know. I plan to keep my promise.
Could you...
Could you take us, as well?
I understand you don't trust us,
so you can keep us bound.
Sir Kimblee shows no mercy to men who can't do their job.
We'll get killed either way.
And besides...
...we don't want to give up, either!
We can trust you, right?
If you two happen to betray us and get in our way, this country could fall to ruin.
Including the people you two hold dear.
Hang on! What do you mean?!
Central never told us anything like that!
Tell us the details! What is this about?!
Is this fine?
Yeah. You all will probably feel safer this way, too.
Scar, we're going to have to ask you to put on an act.
I know.
Keep the vow you swore on your Ishbalan blood.
Hey! You need to take off your earrings!
Those are made out of metal, aren't they?
If you don't take them off, you'll get frostbite.
Ed.
Hold on to these for me.
I'll be waiting for you at the fort!
Kimblee, you bastard!
Why the hell didn't you keep an eye on Winry?! 
I'm worried about Zampano and Jerso.
They were either killed by Scar, or they can't move because of the blizzard...
Scar shouldn't be able to move, either.
He has to be in this town somewhere!
We ought to plan our next search while we're sitting here!
This blizzard really saved us...
I pray that all of you will make it to the fort.
Major Miles, you have a phone call from Briggs.
Miles speaking.
What?!
Oh, so you're the daughter of those Rockbells.
You've heard of my parents?
There isn't a single doctor who was in Ishbal who hasn't.
They fulfilled their duties as doctors without any regard for their own lives.
I haven't forgiven that you killed my parents unjustly!
You must endure.
So you're telling me to forgive the army for what they did?
"Enduring" and "forgiving" are two different things.
You must not forgive the unjustness of society.
As a human being, you must hold the event in contempt.
Yet, you must endure.
You must put an end to the chain of hatred!
If many negative emotions gather,they will end up influencing the entire world.
But on the other hand, it is also possible to gather positive emotions and lead the world in that direction.
That is why I study alchemy.
Oh, here we are.
What is this place?
It's a post for mine officers.
There should be...
Ah, found it.
See? A detailed map of the mine.
It looks pretty complicated.
I don't understand what goes where.
We can just take this path here, you see?
Wow, you're pretty amazing.
Keep the compliments coming!
With this, we should be able to reach the other side of the mountain a lot faster than we thought we would.
Hey, Doctor Marcoh... Do you think those research documents hold anything to get us back to our old bodies?
There is a possibility.
It's tough to say because it's not a form of alchemy we're familiar with.
I've got faith, Doctor!
I really want to see my family!
Even though your wife was always leading you by the nose?
You probably only want to see your daughter.
Look who's talking! You always turn nasty when you're drunk, so your son was just about fed up with you.
You still have the guts to see him now?
That was brutal.
Is something wrong, May?
No.
I was just wondering when I'll be able to return, since my people are waiting for me...
The philosopher's stone uses the lives of humans.
I mustn't seek such a thing.
Even if I tell him how to create one,without bringing back an actual stone,
the Emperor would make plans to create one without hesitation.
By sacrificing the lives of many people...
Immortality... Just what should I do?
That answer may also be hidden in those research documents.
So let's try to get to the fort as quickly as we can to decipher them.
You're right.
The fort is no longer safe?!
Major General Armstrong has been summoned to Central.
Many soldiers from Central are now stationed at the fort, as well.
Kimblee must have proposed it.
He was making quite a few phone calls while at the fort, after all.
Hang on. If the Major General is no longer there...
An officer loyal to Bradley is going to be stationed there.
So, Winry and the rest of them...
It's going to be a lot more difficult to hide them there now.
That's hardly the issue. If things take a turn for the worse, they could fall in the hands of the enemy...
We have to let them know somehow!
It would be impossible to go after them in this blizzard.
But we can't just leave them!
I'm going.
An amateur shouldn't take a blizzard lightly!
It'll suck out all your strength in a matter of minutes, leaving you to freeze to death.
There's another option.
There's someone here with a body that knows no fatigue and won't freeze.
This is worse than I expected...
Now, where's the landmark...
There!
I can't see anything with the snow blowing everywhere.
What was that just now? My body?!
Why?
It's impossible to place a soul on a body that doesn't belong. 
A body that shouldn't possess a soul...
A rejection reaction!
My old body is pulling my soul towards it!
Come on! Get it together!
I have to hurry.
Alphonse Elric.
Edward Elric.
And...
...Van Hohenheim.
Izumi Curtis is also a possibility.
Just one more.
A departure toward an unknown world.
It's due to one's heart seeking something new.
A human can never go against the wishes of his heart,
but conflict always arises in that moment.
Next time, Fullmetal Alchemist:
Episode 40, Homunculus.
The righteous isn't the one to win.
The one to overcome the boundaries shall stand as the winner.Episode 38, Clash in Baschool.
I'll always be watching you from your shadows. 
Hello?
Evening! It's your favorite florist!
What do you want, Colonel?!
Sorry about that.
I was a bit drunk and ended up buying a lot of flowers.
I'd be grateful if you'd be willing to take a few off my hands.
What's wrong?
Did something happen?
No, it's nothing.
Are you sure?
Yes, it's nothing.
I'll have to kindly refuse the flowers.
I don't own a vase to put them in.
But thank you for giving me a call. Good night.
Why does he have such good timing when it comes to things like these?
A man thought to be Scar was sighted on a mountain trail near the area.
We should start here.
An abandoned mine?
That's right.
This town, Baschool, is now a ghost town.
It would make a great hideout.
How troublesome.
So we're going to split up.
If a party spots him, report back immediately.
Roger!
We'll accompany the Elric Brothers.
Yeah, yeah.
I wonder if they're coming to keep an eye on us.
Most likely.
Episode 38, Clash in Baschool.
Now...
How should we get rid of these two...
Hey! I just saw a shadow!
What?!
Over here!
Hey! Hang on!
Hey! Wait!
They disappeared!
Where did they go?!
Did they go into that room?!
Damn them, running around!
We were able to get rid of them, but...
...this place...
...is a bit...
...too big, don't you think?!
Where are Scar and that little girl?
If they don't randomly show up,it'll be impossible for us to find them...
Sir Alphonse!
Sir Alphonse!!!
Hey!
No way...
Sir Alphonse!
She really showed up...
What are you doing here?!
May!
Great! I found you!
Don't tell me... you came here looking for me?
Yeah! I wanted to see you!
Sir Al...
I wanted to see you and learn more about Eastern Alchemy...
Oh my gosh! Am I dreaming? Sir Al came looking for me?
Huh?
Hey, brat!
I've been dying to see you!
I'm not letting you get away this time!
Hurry up and teach us Eastern Alchemy!
You brothers are feuding for my hand!
But you're not my type, Edward!
Don't play dumb with me!
Hey, Al...
Oh, sorry about that.
Ow...
I hit my head.
Who is that woman, Sir Alphonse?!
How horrible... You have me, and yet...
No! She's just an old friend of mine!
Wait... Why am I talking like a two-timer?
May, please don't run off by yourself-
The Elric Brothers?!
Who are you?
It's me, Marcoh.
Dr. Marcoh?!
What happened to your face?
What are you doing here?
The Elric Brothers!
Who the heck are you?
Don't you dare say you forgot!
I'm Yoki, the great coal-mine owner of Youswell!
Guess I forgot.
Actually, I don't even think I know you.
How awful! After all those things you did to me...
1914
Youswell
Youswell, a mining town.
I, Yoki, was a soldier and manager of the town.
The people of the town lived happily due to my efforts.
Hurry up and pay
your taxes!
We can't because you keep cutting our salaries!
And that's where the uttermost villain,Edward Elric, a State Alchemist, showed up!
Silver pocketwatch?!
State Alchemist!!
Gold!!
I want to buy the rights to the coal mine with this.
But it was a trap!
What is this about, Mr. Alchemist?!
All the gold I received from you turned into rocks!
They were working together!
And I, who had the mine stolen from me...
...suffered at the hands of the people who forgot what they owed me...
...and was given a bad name by the military.
I started many businesses in order to return to popularity...
...but it all ended in failure...
My investments...
...also ended in failure...
And my last resort...
...was to ask a millionaire for a goodwill loan...
If only...
If only it hadn't been for those Elric Brothers...
And that was when I swore...
Swore to take revenge against those two who brought me down like this.
An act of revenge far worse than death!
I won't lose to a thief like you!
No... I'm not really a thief...
I'm telling you, there's nothing between us!
Who cares! I need to ask you about Eastern Alchemy!
Hey! How about you two listen to me?!
Yeah, whatever. It must have been hard, old man.
I totally understand how you feel.
Quit pretending like you were listening!
You can't find Miss Winry?
Seriously... what were you all doing?
We're terribly sorry...
I'll go look for her.
Two men from Charlie squad come with me.
Yes, sir!
Major Miles.
I know. Scar, right?
I'll contact you if I find him.
This place is no good either, huh?
There's barely anything here.
You're Scar, right?
Sir Kimblee would like to see you.
Come with us.
I'm surprised you were able to find me.
But do you really think the two of you can take me?
Probably not, if we were ordinary humans.

Chimeras, huh...
Interesting!
I've learned a lot since then.
First, the method to create a philosopher's stone.
Second, the history of this country. And that there's something odd about the alchemy this country uses.
That's why we came after this girl, seeking a possibility in Eastern Alchemy from Xing.
Nothing less to be expected from you.
The thing is, someone realized it far before you did.
These are the research documents he left us.
We think these documents may hold a clue to solving the mystery.
So if we could decipher it...
Yes, possibly...
But to do that, we need Scar's help.
Why him?!
What was that sound?
That's where Scar went!
Could it be the army?!
You four hide here.
We'll go see what's going on.
Scar is...
He's fat, but that doesn't slow him down at all!
I heard you're powerless unless you can actually touch us.
So we're going to be attacking from a distance.
And we're also aware that you attempt to destroy the ground when things get bad for you.
We'll beat you to a pulp and hand you over to Sir Kimblee!
Talk about good timing.
The Elric Brothers?
This voice...
Brother, they're Kimblee's men from Central.
What?
I get it...
You don't need to do anything besides watch.
We're going to capture Scar-
A monster!!!
W-What was that for?! We're on your sid-
I don't recall having any monsters on our side!
How frightening!
They're going to pretend they're on our side, then eat us!
The fat one back there has a really big mouth! He'll eat me whole!
You brat! Stay put!
Is he faster than Scar?!
Brother?
What's so funny?!
So light!
It feels like my limbs are made of feathers!
Northern automails are fabulous!
Don't get too cocky now...
Huh? I guess my punches lost some force, too.
My spit won't come off that easily!
This is slob?! That's just gross!
In that case...
If I decompose it, it's pretty much water!
Th-That's cold!!
Take this!
What the heck was that for, Brother?!
O-O-Ow! Stop moving!
You're going to tear my skin off!
How did you like my "Touching Cold Metal With Wet Hands and Getting Stuck Together" attack?
Quit getting in our way, Fullmetal Alchemist!
Aren't you on 
Shut up, pig! I don't know anyone who looks like you!
Besides, anyone can tell you're a bad guy!
If you still insist that you're on our side, prove it!
Fine! I'll transform back, just watch!
I've been waiting for this!
Zampano!
How foolish of you to sheathyour sword in front of your enemy.
Dammit! Get off me!
Okay, I'm going to need you to take a little nap.
He's in fighting shape, now...
Hurry up and get caught already.
Face trial, Scar!
I'll destroy whoever gets in my way.
He's coming head-on, without thinking?
Your steel arm is mine!
Sorry. It's not made out of steel anymore!
Stay still!
Stop it!
Idiot! Why did you come?!
Stay back.
Major Miles.
Wh-What's up with these two?
The people at Central seem to be conducting awful experiments.
Tie them to that pillar over there.
Aye, sir!
Now, Scar...
It doesn't please me to pass judgment on a fellow countryman, but I can't let someone like you run free.
Fellow countryman?
Elric Brothers, we'll take care of the rest...
Winry!
Idiot! Stay away from him!
Let me go... I'll be fine.
How will you be fine?!
Stay away from him, Miss.
Please let me talk to him.
I want to talk to him face to face.
Why did you kill my parents?
No matter what I say, it'll be only be an excuse.
The fact is I killed the Rockbells.
What was that?!
It's in the location of the building we received a report from!
This isn't good. We've been down here for more than twenty-four hours, which is what we promised.
It's the Ice Queen we're talking about.
I'm sure she really sealed the exit.
It's only natural we took so long.
We groped our way here with the lanterns out, after all.
Since they insisted a monster would come if we kept the lights on.
Welcome back.
Thank goodness!
Take these two to the infirmary. Quickly!
Sorry for the trouble...
You have nothing to apologize for.
I thought I told you to seal the exit after twenty-four hours?
Ah. But, look.
It hasn't been twenty-four hours yet.
By the way, Major General Armstrong told me to go by this watch.
General!
Was the advance unit safe?
Just two of them.
I see.
What are you doing here, if I may ask?
I was looking at the mountains.
Winter is nice here, isn't it?
I only see black and white.
It's very plain, and I like it.
Do you think so?
If you look up, there's also the color blue.
It's just like a person's heart, isn't it?
I greatly appreciate you giving us leeway this time, ma'am.
Huh? I have no idea what you're talking about.
Looks like we've got some guests.
It's been a while.
Sorry for asking this the moment of my arrival,but is there something you owe us an explanation for?
Don't get too close!
All men, stay back!
Dammit!
Fullmetal Alchemist?
Kimblee!
Why the hell didn't you keep an eye on Winry?!
Mr. Kimblee, the roof!
Even if an encounter is accompanied by grief,
there is still meaning in it.
The path to take is inscribed in feelings that come and go.
Next time, Fullmetal Alchemist:
Episode 39, Daydream.
Is everything part of a plan devised by a superior being?The FÃ¼hrer President has returned?!
I heard he destroyed a tank from Briggs at the main gate.
That'll show those monkeys from Briggs!
Let's gather the rest of the soldiers.
We need to recapture mission headquarters!
Yeah!
The FÃ¼hrer President is at the main gate?
Oh.
It's my first time seeing him with my own eyes.
So he's the one who ripped off my granddaughter's arm...!
Episode 57, Eternal Rest.
I see.
So you were planning on sacrificing all the civiliansso that you high-level officials would gain immortality,
and unify the world.
Is FÃ¼hrer President Bradley doing everythingeven with the knowledge of what you all are up to?
He's the leader of this country,and was made for that purpose.
Why are you hesitating?!
We're planning on creating a world without war!
So you're saying the world should be destroyed once for that purpose?
It's not destruction, but rather regeneration.
It's the 'reconstruction' stage that you alchemists refer to.
The civilians aren't going to be given 'death'.
They're going to receive the honor of living within us forever!
And we're going to unify the world together!
All is one, and one is all!
We, the chosen ones of Amestris, will become one and-
You heard him.
What will you guys do?
They're trying to gain everything for themselves.
Are you just going to let him go?
C-Come along with me, you all.
If you do, I'll ask that man to-
I'm a soldier, so I must obey the orders of my superiors.
But to be honest, I don't know what to believe anymore...
You're still hesitating in this situation?
Obeying a superior you can't even believe doesn't make you loyal.
You're just fooling yourself.
Believe in yourselves.
Just choose a way of living that won't shame your soul.
I have family in the city.
So do I.
I, too, as well.
Brigadier General,
this is our answer.
Mission headquarters, what's the situation?
Not too great.
The Central Soldiers have begun to recover in several areas.
Where are you right now, General?
The FÃ¼hrer President's office.
And the survivors?
We haven't been able to get in touch with our men who are around the office.
There's a high possibility that there are many Central Soldiers surrounding it.
Roger.
If things get dangerous over there, run.
Just leave me behind.
Aye, Ma'am.
Now, this place has become filled with enemies again.
It's only a matter of time until the Central Soldiers form up and storm this place.
Which means...
After going down a bit,
I'll dig a side tunnel as an escape route, just like I did when I came here.
Escape...
Why don't we escape together?
You all could probably use some time to recover and plan, couldn't you?
He's close.
You think so too?
You two can sense him?
It's more of a "bad feeling".
Like the feeling you get when a bad scar starts aching.
Oh my, do I have guests?
I'm a little nervous.
Who are you?!
Me?
Hmm...
The man who created King Bradley...
...perhaps?
The FÃ¼hrer President...
Which means you're on their side.
Huh? You're...
I thought you were at the radio station,but you actually took the effort to come here.
Thanks for giving me one less thing to do, Mustang.
Guys, entertain them for a while.
Who the hell are they?!
Dolls?!
No...
Their movements clearly differ from the dolls!
They're men who might have become King Bradley.
They were gathered as soon as they were born,
and they were given special education and training
for the sole purpose of becoming the FÃ¼hrer President.
And with the twelfth experiment, King Bradley was born.
So these are...!
The leftovers.
Despite that, they've been training for battle all this time.
Although they're not as powerful as King Bradley,
they're pretty good.
Damn...
...those rebels...!
Shit, I passed out.
Captain!
That's right...
If I were to pull it out, I'd probably die from blood loss.
Bradley...!
That was close, old man!
It was an accident, youn-
It wasn't on purpose!
You-
As I thought, prey like you gets my heart pumping faster.
I'm surprised you put up such a good fight despite being more aged than I.
But...!
It ends here!
Gramps!
The prince from Xing, eh?
Dammit, Ling!
Quit taking over without asking!
You're just like the girl who cut her own arm off.
Just like her, you endanger your life for something you can't throw away.
Young master...
I can no longer fight. Just throw me away...
Quit joking!
Are you telling me to become a man like him?!
A king exists for his people.
Without his people, there is no king.
He's planning on abandoning the people of his country.
That's not someone I want to become!
A man unworthy of being called 'king', huh...
Then we must defeat him.
Don't speak!
Take a break!
I agree.
I'll take a break...
I shall rest.
Harden, Greed!
Protect the young master's body!
R-Right!
Young master...
Become king.
It's time for this old geezer to begin his eternal rest!
Idiot!!
Idiot!!
You're coming to hell with me,
Bradley!!
I can't give him a single wound, even by risking my life?
Young master...
I'm so sorry...
Even if you possess the eyes of God,
you can't possibly dodge an attack coming from somewhere you can't see!
Old man, I'll... be going...
to hell with you...
I'm so grateful...
Grandpa!!!
Jesus!
First you get stuck in a ditch,then you ram into a lightpost?!
You really suck at driving!
Shut it!
Be thankful that we were able to get this far in a beat up car like that!
We've come this far! Stop fighting!
Anyway, we need to hurry up and find a place where we can get underground.
That's...
Colonel Mustang?
I hope they're doing well.
Brother...
Let's hurry!
How non-human can your movements get?!
Colonel, your back is wide open.
There's someone I've entrusted my back to, so yeah.
The Gate of Truth.
Human transmutation, a taboo in alchemy.
Alchemists who try it end up opening the Gate of Truth,
paying a befitting toll.
So that's how the Elric Brothers sacrificed their bodies?
Did you do it too?
They took a bit of my insides.
But what I learned from all that,
is that human transmutation never works.
Oh my, soldiers like yourselves probably aren't interested in tales like these.
Not true.
Humans who have opened the Gate of Truth are the "human sacrifices" they speak of.
You may have a handhold in finding out what they are up to.
So you all had someone you wanted to see again,
even if you had to open the Gate of Truth and sacrifice your body.
What about you?
Do you have someone that you'd give up anything for just to see again?
Now that's something that means nothing to a soldier.
Having regret for the deceased is pointless.
We fight in order to keep them alive.
That's true.
But...
...I feel like I understand something now.
Edward Elric.
When I first met him, I threatened him and told him to tell me everything he knows,
but that boy didn't say a word about his old friend having been taken hostage.
Just one line:
"Please try to realize."
Those eyes were different from those of us soldiers,
or even those of State Alchemists,who are referred to as the dogs of the military.
If I had to say, they were eyes that didn't want to lose anything important to them again no matter what...
Eyes of an unreasonable child?
I'd be lying if I said that those straightforward eyes didn't move my heart.
But will those naÃ¯vely honest feelings of hisfind a way out of the difficulty in this fight,
or will they come back to harm him?
There.
Let us begin.
Number 16,
Number 17,
Number 21,
Number 23, Number 26.
Come here.
What?!
Here we go!
What did you do?!
This is just the first step.
Do you know how many alchemy research facilities under direct control of the FÃ¼hrer President exist in Central?
There should be four that are currently being used...
No!
Research Laboratory 5...
There are five!
A transmutation circle with five points!
Could it be that the curving underground path was a circle that connects the research facilities?!
What?!
What's wrong, Mr. Heinkel?
Izumi.
Yeah.
Seems like this is a good spot.
I'm going to dig a hole for escape purposes in this wall.
Stand back.
Then this is where we say goodbye.
We still need to remain here and fight.
From here on out is probably the enemy's backbone.
We can't just let our chance to ambush them go to waste.
You...
Thanks for all your help.
We're in your debt, Izumi Curtis.
I should be saying that, Major General Arm-
What?!
Alphonse!
Izumi!
Izumi!!
F-Fullmetal...!
Dammit...!!
Anger is born from despair.
Two souls will use a single body, and start to kill everything.
Next time, Fullmetal Alchemist:
Episode 58, Human Sacrifices.
Continuing to protect even after death is their long-cherished plan.Well...
It really does look like the drawing, but...
Isn't she just the cutest thing?
That's definitely not it!
I know that!
We really don't have time for these jokes!
Really...
Where could she be?
Episode 32, The FÃ¼hrer President's Son.
East City!
You've arrived in East City!
Here's the latest news on Scar.
He's still on the run?
What a persistent guy.
Oh my, I'm terribly sorry.
No, it's my fault for not paying attention.
You are wearing some unusual attire.
Are you not from this country?
I'm from Xing.
Oh, my.
Are you here to see the sights?
There's not much to see in East City, is there?
No, I just stopped by because I need to switch trains here.
I'm headed to the North.

Oh, no!
Thank you for helping me pick up the groceries!

Have a safe trip!
Hm?
What a peculiar kitty.
Where did he go?!
I know I heard footsteps...
There he is!
So he was with a middle-aged man with black hair?
Yes. According to the reports, sir.
This is where he was yesterday.
So he's headed West, huh?
We have a few injured, some slightly, others seriously.
Scar must be desperate, too.
But even so...
...he's attracting a lot of attention.
Now, let's head off to work.
Well, whatever.
That has nothing to do with me.
A funeral, eh?
Yes, it seems so.
It isn't pretty, is it?
When you get old like me, you can't help but think about when you'll be the one getting buried.
What a terrible thing to say, madam.
As far as I can see, you have a long life ahead of you.
Lieutenant General Grumman?!
You said we were going to meet in front of Brigadier General Hughes' grave, right?
I figured it was something serious since you decided to take the measure of last resort.
To be doubly sure, I decided to disguise myself.
Well, I shouldn't have expected less from you, a man so famous for his eccentricity.
Your disguise exceeded my expectations.
Eccentric?
I'll take that as a compliment.
So, what's the matter?
Eastern Alchemy.
We may be able to find something in the Central Library.
Maybe.
Since we can't find the midget,we'll have to search on our own.
I hope we can at least find some clues.
I see. So the entire upper echelon of Central is guilty, huh?
But you lost far too much in exchange for the information.
You have nothing left if they take away the men you can trust.
You're right, sir. I can't argue with that.
Even Raven, huh...
When I was in Central a little while ago, Raven asked me...
"Are you interested in a perfect, immortal army?"
Immortal army?
Was he talking about the homunculi?
I flat-out rejected him, saying that it was rubbish.
Then soon after,
I was sent to Eastern Headquarters.
Relegated?
Thanks to that, I'm now stuck cleaning up after all the messes in the East.
More on that topic, do you happen to remember the riot in Liore?
The case where the Fullmetal Alchemist exposed the fake priest of Leto's conspiracy.
Yes, I do remember.
Although Liore was thrown into disarray,
the riot was quickly suppressed thanks to theEastern Army's rapid response while it was still minor.
But the Central Army intruded on the scene, and the Eastern Army was withdrawn.
Am I right?
Yes.
Liore's public order suddenly turned forthe worse when the Central Army entered the scene.
Those guys at Central are reallyplanning something, aren't they?
I don't even want to think about it!
Can't things be peaceful until I retire?
Again with the jokes.
You're the great Lieutenant General Grumman.
I'm sure you haven't felt satisfied for a second at simply being the head man for a region of the country.
You have the Eastern Army on your side;full of veteran soldiers who experienced Ishbal.
I had always thought you'd use that secret contact memo when you needed to whine and beg me for help.
But you called me here to get me worked up, huh?
Geez...
Now that things are getting interesting in Central,
the flame of ambition in my heart has been lit once more.
Don't get too serious or your makeup will be ruined, madam.
Oh, no!
Are you free after this?
If you don't mind, would you like to join me for a cup of tea?
Oh, no, thank you.
I appreciate the invitation, but...
It's no good.
Why doesn't this place have any good books on Eastern Alchemy?
Maybe I'll just visit Xing and study there instead...
Wait, but there's no way I'll be able to cross that desert with my automail...
There you are, Edward Elric.
M-Major! What are you doing here?!
Shh!
You have to be quiet in the library.
I heard you're after a girl from Xingwho carries around a black and white cat.
Yeah.
Wait, how did you know that?
I heard from Colonel Mustang.
I'm here today on the Colonel's orders.
Apparently, she's headed north.
According to a witness, she was inEast City and was headed north from there.
North, huh?
Okay. If we know that much, it's safe to give it a try.
Thanks a lot, Major.
Tell the Colonel I said thanks, too.
Hang on.
Don't be in such a rush.
Take this with you.
What's this?
It's a letter of introduction.
It may not do you much good,
but you should meet her first.
Meet who?
She resides even farther north than the Northern Headquarters.
A general who guards the Drachma border and holds another name, the "Northern Wall of Briggs"...
...Major General Armstrong.
Hurry!
You've got nowhere to run, Scar!
Where did he go?!
Report this to Headquarters!
That train is headed for West City!
Damn him...
I can't really find much on Eastern Alchemy...
May's long-distance transmutation was awesome.
I wish I could use that...
I should have asked her about it when she was still at Dr. Nox's place.
Ling said that it's used predominantly for medical purposes...
Are you the Fullmetal Alchemist's little brother who wears a giant suit wherever he goes?
Y-Yes...
Amazing!
Wow! Wow!
Thanks...
But you need to keep it down. We're in a library.
Oh, I'm sorry.
What are you studying?
Eastern Alchemy.
Eastern Alchemy?
It's a form of alchemy used in Xing.
Wow... Xing, huh?
But aren't you Elric Brothers skilled enough to be state qualified in Amestris, a nation so advanced in alchemy?
Why are you researching minor forms of alchemy used in other countries?
Huh?
I can't exactly say, "I'm looking for a way to get my body back and fight homunculi"...
Umm...
They say that Eastern Alchemy is used predominantly for medical purposes.
I'm researching to see if there are any other ways human lives could be saved.
Wow! Nothing less to be expected from the Elric Brothers!
Al! Alphonse!
Get your things together! We're leaving!
Brother, you have to keep it down in the library!
Wait, where are we going?
I'll explain the details on the way.
Either way, we need to go.
Go to the hotel and pack.
Whose brat is this?
If you're his brother, it must mean you're Edward, the State Alchemist!
Yeah.
Wow!
So the rumors were true! You really are a tiny alchemist!
What?!
H-Hey...
Say that again...
Come on, say it again.
You're up for a ride.
Want me to blast you to Neptune?
Wow!
So they were right! You get really angry when people say you're short!
Back away from Sir Selim!
You can't shoot him!
Don't tell me... you're Selim Bradley?
The FÃ¼hrer President's son?!
Yup! That's right!
What the heck are we doing here?
Aren't we supposed to be headed north?
Not like it was my choice...
I'm sorry.
This boy has admired you for so long, Mr. Edward.
Admired?
Do you like alchemy, Selim?
I do.
My dream is to learn alchemy and become a State Alchemist like Mr. Edward.
Admired me, huh...
Wow...
Then, I want to be useful to Father.
Do you love your Father...
...FÃ¼hrer President King Bradley?
Of course!
What's he like?
He's a very noble man.
He perseveres through hard work that would make a normal person cry...
...and works every day with only one thing in mind: the well-being of his people.
I see.
The FÃ¼hrer President 
Yes, he is.
He still plans on working to his fullest in active service.
I'm constantly telling him to retire already, bearing his age in mind.
He's always been someone totally committed to his work.
He can do his job, but he's always been a blockhead when it comes to women.
He was so impolite; I gave him a good slap across the face.
Well, that's where it all started. Then, we started dating.
And our first date was...
Oh, my.
I didn't mean to talk about senseless things.
Father!
What a surprise!
Welcome home!
Thanks, Selim.
Why the surprise visit?
I had some rare free time, so I came to see your faces.
Then, I heard the Fullmetal Alchemist was here.
Hello.
It's been a while.
We just saw each other at Central Headquarters, didn't we?
I see. So you met each other at the library.
Yep!
What, are you trying to say that we don't look alike?
N-No, that's not it...
We're not connected by blood.
We were never able to have kids.
So we adopted him from a relative.
He grew up to become a kind boy who cares so much for his parents.
Stop it, Father.
It's embarrassing.
I'm only stating the truth.
Is something the matter?
N-No, it's just that we only see you when you're working at Headquarters.
So it's just... right, Brother?
I guess we're just stunned to see such a different side of you.
I see.
I, too, have family.
Even someone like me.
Although it's a bit different from your family.
Are you leaving already, Father?
Yeah. It's about time for me to return to the office.
Enjoy your stay,
State Alchemist.
Let's go.
Come visit again!
Okay, thanks.
I don't think his wife or son know that he's a homunculus...
Anyway, we need to head north! All the way!
We need to get a hold of that midget andmake her tell us the secret behind Eastern Alchemy!
Right!
We'll be there by morning.
Sleep for now.
I see... so you let them get away again.
This is a map of the West, correct?
Yes, sir.
He was last seen...
Here.
And this is West City.
Scar and Marcoh disappeared somewhere in between.
A train must slow down significantly at a curve, correct?
Is it possible for someone to jump off?
I wouldn't say it's impossible, but it's very dangerous.
I see.
Well then, I wonder which direction they ran after they jumped off?
North...
...or south...
Could it be our first time traveling north?
Yeah.
I wonder if we'll be able to see snow?
Snow, huh...
I guess it rarely stuck to the ground in Resembool.
The cat and the mouse.
Insanity and hatred clash in a white world.
The fiercest battle yet opens the gate to a new world.
Next time, Fullmetal Alchemist:
Episode 33, The Northern Wall of Briggs.
Her golden hair is a flame made of ice.That was so exhausting!
They were watching us the whole time, too.
Mr. Fu and Lan Fan, right?
Hey!
Where's the young master!?
I don't see him...
Could he have gone missing again?
Seriously... The instant I take my eyes off him...
Young master!
Where have you gone?!
I hope he hasn't collapsed somewhere like last time...
Good riddance.
Let's go.
Okay...
Young master! Where are you?!
There's something... odd about this country.
Episode 16, A Comrade in Arms' Footsteps.
It's me. I came to visit.
Good work.
From the Colonel.
Yo, it's the cigarette kid!
How are you doing? Were you even able to beat him once?
Not a chance.
This game is pretty boring, too.
Hey, I can go cut people up if it's just at night, right?
Of course not!
Then, could you at least... bring that Hawkeye lady?
Yeah, I'll mention it to her.
How much longer do I have to watch over this guy?
What did the Colonel say?
"Sorry for putting you in charge of such a dangerous task."
"Don't worry about military duty, though."
"I've marked you down as absent due to illness."
"However, you're as good as dead if a civilianor someone from the military besides us finds you."
...is what he said.
Any good news?
Yup.
Huh? What is it?
I got a girlfriend!
She really helped me out when I was struggling with the transfer and all.
She's such a babe, too!
Hey, do you think I'd enjoy cutting her up?
Just go home already...
Oh my.
What's wrong with him?
Hey, are you all right?
Is he okay?
F-Food...
He's completely out of it.
Where's he from?
What? You came from Xing?
That's so far...
By the way, where's your certificate of entry?
Make way! Make way!
Illegal entrant coming through!
Young master! Where are you?!
He's passed out somewhere... I just know he has!
Well, let's go say hi to the military first.
Let's.
Then... I think I'll go visit Mr. Hughes' place first.
I can't wait to see Miss Gracia and Elicia, either.
Okay.
We'll head over there afterwards.
Well, see you then.
I wonder if Lt. Colonel Hughes uncoveredmore information about the stone for us since then.
Well, the FÃ¼hrer President warned him to stay out of it, too.
Let's give him the information we obtained, first.
Homunculus...
Yeah.
The Lt. Colonel should be at the military chambers...
Over there!
Sheska?
Sheska!
Yes?
You have the key to that room, right?
Yes, I do.
Oh... Room 3, you mean?
I've kind of made a mess in there...
Don't worry about it. I just need to grab some documents.
I'm telling you, it's not all right.
I'll clean it up right away, so please give me a moment!
Okay. I'll come get it later, so please finish by then.
Y-Yes, ma'am!
Umm... Colonel?
Colonel Mustang.
How many minutes was I asleep?
I'd say about ten.
I don't have much time before the army council.
Excuse my unsolicited advice, but perhapsyou should rest instead of straining yourself?
Yeah, I'll come again.
Was that Colonel Mustang?
G-Good morning, Captain Focker!
Morning, Sheska.
But why was the Colonel here?
W-Well... you see...
The door to the archives is open, too.
I'm sorry! The truth is, well...
Let me guess, the colonel railroaded through, right?
I'll keep it a secret.
Thank you so much!
But I wonder what he was looking up?
Any idea?
I don't know the details either,
but he asked me whether there wereany documents concerning Research Laboratory 5.
That, and the murder of Brigadier General Hughes...
It's thanks to the Brigadier General that I got a job here.
Ah, that's right.
Well, there's a lot of work to do today as always.
I'm counting on you.
Yes, sir.
Morning, Sheska.
Yes? Huh?
What?
Hello.
Did you perhaps lose some weight?
I might have.
You were injured?
Just some trouble down south.
It's just a scratch.
I see.
By the way, I met the Elric Brothers while I was down there.
A coincidence. They were meeting their master, who lives in Dublith.
Major.
Yes?
Have you told them about Hughes' death?
No, I couldn't bring myself to tell them.
They'll find out sooner or later.
I know that, sir.
Research Laboratory 5 and the philosopher's stones.
The ingredients to the stones are live humans.
He was such an accommodating guy.

Is that why you won't tell them?
If they find out Hughes died because he got involved with them, they'd be devastated...
You're too kind.
And you know too much.
I'm almost there.
Please be careful.
No one knows who could be listening.
I'll be going on ahead.
Huh? Lieutenant Hawkeye!
Ah, it's been a while.
If you're here, that means...
Sorry to make you wait.
I knew it...
Oh, Fullmetal.
Why the hell are you here, Colonel?
I was transferred to Central effective last month.
And what about you? What brings you here?
Just collecting some information.
We were also thinking about going to say hi to Lt. Colonel Hughes.
How's he doing?
He's no longer here.
Huh?
He decided to retire to the country.
He's going to take over the family business along with his wife and daughter.
So he's not here.
Oh... that's too bad.
We were looking forward to seeing him, too...
Fullmetal.
Don't jump the gun and do anything reckless.
Sure.
Treating them like children only at a time like this?
They don't need to know right now.
It's better if there are fewer obstacles for those brothers to move forward.
But they'll find out eventually.
I don't have the right to callMajor Armstrong soft-hearted, either.
Soft-hearted?
Don't you mean cruel?
So the Lt. Colonel isn't around, huh...
Oh, I almost forgot, Brother.
We have to let Winry know.
She's headed for his home.
You're right.
Second Lieutenant Ross!
It's been a while, you two.
What's the hurry?
We heard about Lt. Colonel Hughes, so...
I see...
It's hard, isn't it?
There was so much I wanted to say to him, too...
I wish we had a chance to have a proper farewell with him.
No one contacted you about it, huh?
Don't worry.
The army gave him a proper farewell.
Really? That's nice of you guys.
Of course.
Also, you may have heard this already, but he was specially promoted two ranks to the rank of Brigadier General.
Specially promoted two ranks?
He was specially promoted for retiring to the country?
Second Lieutenant Ross!
Here you go.
Thanks.
You can't be serious! Why was he...
Why?!
Brother!
Brigadier General Hughes was murdered by someone soon after you were released from the hospital.
They haven't caught the perpetrator yet.
It's my fault...
I dragged him into this! Lt. Colonel Hughes!
Well, careful out there.
Be sure to drop by if you ever come to Central again. 
Oh, Alphonse, you can't eat with that armor on, can you? 
You guys probably haven't booked a place to stay at yet, right? 
If so, stay at my place. 
Papa!
What are you going to do?
I'm going to tell them everything.
You head back.
I'm the only one who needs to face them.
It's not just your problem.
It concerns both of us.
So I'm going, too.
Hey, Al.
What if-
We chose to get our bodies back no matter what,
but if people end up dying because of it, I'd rather not.
Winry just came by, too...
We know.
Winry.
There's something I need to tell you, Miss Gracia.
Is that okay?
Something to tell me?
Yes.
And to Winry, too.
So my husband uncovered something about these philosopher's stones...
And his death is the murderers' way of saying "don't meddle in our affairs"?
We basically dragged him in.
I'm so sorry.
I'm terribly sorry...
If he died while trying to help someone, then that's just like him.
He's always been a meddling, accommodating kind of guy, and he'd always end up losing things due to his kindness.
But I don't think he's ever regretted it.
Even till the moment of his death.
We're...
Don't tell me you're going to give up.
If you two give up here, it'd meanmy husband's death was completely meaningless.
Even if it's impossible with the philosopher's stones, there may be other ways, right?
Miss Gracia...
Move forward on the path you're content with.
Mama...
Please don't cry, Mama...
You're in there, right, Winry?
You haven't eaten yet, have you?
The dining hall's going to close soon.
Okay...
You won't be able to function without food.
Yeah...
Well, I'm heading back to my room.
Apple pie?
I practiced making it a few times since then.
I don't mean to brag, but I've gotten really good at it.
Well, it's nowhere near as good as Miss Gracia's, though...
Someday...
I wanted Mr. Hughes to try it.
The Colonel is digging aroundfor information about Hughes' death?
Yeah.
I wonder if he's discovered anything?
Maybe.
What do we do?
We moved him to Central to keep an eye on him...
Can't he just behave?
He's a precious candidate for sacrifice.
You haven't gotten any information out of your boyfriend?
Nothing.
I can't even tell if he's foolish or able.
I'll go hunt for some information again.
We're going, Gluttony.
Geez, Gluttony! Don't leave this place a mess!
Seriously...
Hey, Lust?
We just need the Flame Alchemist to behave, right?
That's right.
Are you up for taking another measure?
Got something on your mind?
The best way to shut up an annoying dog is to give him some food.
Second Lieutenant Maria Ross.
I'm Henry Douglas from military police headquarters.
Can I help you?
You're coming with me.
Your sidearm.
Care to explain?
Your name has been called as amaterial witness in the murder of Maes Hughes.
That's impossible!
You can explain yourself later.
Come with me.
Second Lieutenant Maria Ross is denying all charges.
Collect all data concerning her.
Make it quick.
However, do it in strict secrecy.
Yes, sir!
Hey lady, could you wrap up these flowers for me?
Oh my, are you going on a date? You lady-killer!
Did I make you wait, Solaris?
No, I just got here.
I've been dying to see you, Jean.
I'm looking forward to hearing your interesting stories again.
The sacrificial lamb is engulfed in the flames of hatred...
...and leaves the boy with feelings of hate and regret.
And the man reaches out to the darkness.
Next time, Fullmetal Alchemist:
Episode 17, Cool-Headed Flames.
All is playing into the hands of the unknown.Bastard!
That's as far as you're going to get.
Episode 62, A Vehement Counterattack.
Dad!
He was trying to make philosopher's stones again.
Humans should just stay as stones.
Why do you treat humans like such lowly creatures?
Philosopher's stones can be created from humans,
and homunculi can be created from philosopher's stones.
So, answer me. What can be created from homunculi?
What do you give birth to?!
An existence that only brings about destruction can be called 'God'?
You may believe that you've become a perfect being,
but all you are is an obstacle in the cycle of life!
Is that so?
Then I shall give birth to humans.
I've obtained immortality....
I'm still alive...
King Xerxes!
A body!
This body is mine!
Finally, a body...
Stop...
Please, stop...
This... This isn't right!
Look! A body!
Hohenheim...
Guys...
You!!
Shoot!
What the hell is going on?!
Shit!
Greed!
D.K.!
Looks like you're okay.
Great timing! Give me a ride.
It'll probably help to have someone with you who knows what's up.
Yeah! What on earth is going on?!
The leader of the homunculi, "Father," is off on a rampage.
Those who can't fight should get off right here!
Hey!
The frog and the two princesses!
Scram!
You're all injured!
Don't be ridiculous!
Who else but me will take the lead?!
Hell if I know!
Just get the hell off of there!
This ain't the time to be blabbering on about leading!
You have no right to-
General!
A call from headquarters.
Mission headquarters? It's me.
What's the status over there?
Ma'am, half of Central Headquarters...
...has been annihilated.
What?
We can't get in touch with the North Gate.
That's what he's capable of.
Just what is he...?
He looks like an ordinary human from the outside.
However, he has several hundred thousand human souls worth of philosopher's stones stored in his body,
and has absorbed God with that energy.
You alchemists out there should understand the severity of the situation.
Philosopher's stones...
You ordinary humans should stay behind.
My men are up there fighting.
I am their commander.
General, headquarters would like to speak with you.
What is it?
Don't worry, General.
Don't forget that we Briggs soldiers are capable of operating even if our boss is absent.
Armory, Team Yellow! Are you alive?!
East Gate, Team Blue! Come in!
We overheard that you're injured.
Please watch over us from there.
Alex!
Ma'am!
Bring the communications equipment!
Win no matter what!
Of course we will!
Right. Let's go, Lieutenant.
Hey! Both of you are hurt!
I'll burn his philosopher's stone to a crisp.
But in order for me to do that, I'll need the lieutenant's help.
Who cares, let's get a move on.
My duty is to protect the young master.
Please take care of Izumi...
...and everyone else.
Let's rock 'n' roll!!
So this is where he bit the dust.
Did you do this?
He was heavily injured by the time he got here.
If that hadn't been the case, I'm not sure whether I would have made it out alive.
Captain Buccaneer dealt a fatal blow to Bradley with the aid of a man from Xing...
So, Bradley...
...wouldn't you say my men were quite something?
Shao May, you're all right...
Thank goodness...
Sir Alphonse?!
May...
I'm glad you're alive...
Sir Alphonse, your body...!
Sir Alphonse!
Oh no! If you hadn't protected me...!
Sir Alphonse!
Sir Alphonse!!
Master!
Master! Master!!
I'm still alive...
Mr. Hohenheim protected us...
H-Hohenheim!
Hey! Hang in there!
Hohenheim!!
Two to start with.
Stop it!!
Our target is a man with long, blonde hair!
Don't confuse him with the Fullmetal Alchemist!
Roger!
East Gate, Team Blue! Step on it!
West Gate, Team White! Get in the shadows of the west building of headquarters!
Yes, sir!
Master!
Fire!!
Yo, Fullmetal! You alive?
Attacks like these won't even scratch him!
You're kidding me!
Don't give him a chance to counterattack!
Aye, sir!
Dammit! He looks like he's enjoying the breeze!
Roger that!
Put me through to each squadron.
Is that so?!
Cease fire! Duck!
Did I hit him?
Grazed him.
Fix your aim towards 12 o'clock.
I can't see, so I don't know how much I should suppress my flames.
Don't suppress them at all!
Distance 50...
No, 53!
I still can't get used to this clapping business.
A frontal attack!
Nice work!
Take that back. It's pretty useful.
Fire! Fire!
Keep it up!
Don't give him the chance to counterattack!
Keep making him use up his philosopher's stone!
Incredible!
I could make the world mine if I had that power!
Hey, Greed!
Is this what you meant by "making the world yours"?
That's right!
If I could just obtain that, the entire world would be mine!
This feeling of emptiness inside me might just be cured!
The thirst that's been haunting me since birth just might be quenched!
You're disgraceful, Greed.
That's not what you really want.
Keep your mouth shut, shitty brat!
I'm Greed, the avaricious!
I'll obtain everything I want at any cost!
Homunculus Cake, anyone?
Not even a scratch...
We need to do something about that barrier!
We're running out of ammo! Bring us some more!
Futile acts.
Mere humans can hardly lay a finger on me.
If humans can't, what about a homunculus?!
Great timing, Greed.
You're such a good son.
I was just in need of a philosopher's stone.
I'll be taking yours.
Just kidding.
You can't take my philosopher's stone without putting your barrier down, right?
Did you not consider the possibility that you'd have the power of God taken from you instead?
I'll take all of it!
Greed!
Don't give up!
He... blocked it himself.
He's at his limit!
He can no longer hold down God!
Stone...!
Stone!
Philosopher's stone!
Run, Edward!
Brother, run!
Brother!!
Stop it!
Dammit!!
Sir Al!
Stop...!
Stop it!
Help...
Help him...!
Help my-
May, I need you to do me a favor.
Brother got my soul back by sacrificing his right arm.
In that case, it should be possible to do the opposite.
Sir Alphonse...?
All I need you to do is to make a path.
You can do it, right?
But if I did that, you'd...!
We're running out of time!
Please.
You're the only one I can ask to do something like this.
Stone...
Human...
Energy...!
Edward!!
Give it to me!!
What are you trying to do...?
Cut it out...
Hey...
Al!
Win this, Brother.
Don't do it!!!
Was that enough for you?
Yeah.
All that's left for me to do now is to believe in him.
Yo. Looks like you got your soul back.
Think he'll come here to bring you back?
He will. I know he will.
I'm curious to see what he'll sacrifice to do so.
You idiot!!
It's working.
He... He has a chance!
Keep it up!
Kiddo!!
That's the spirit!
Get him, kid!
Rush in!
Edward!
Ed!
Edward Elric!
Go!!
Greed.
Isn't this...
...what you've always wanted more than anything?
Mr. Edward!
Edward!
Go!
Fullmetal!
Yeah, you're right on target.
What I've always wanted...
...are friends like these.
Get up, third-rate!
I'll show you the difference in our skill!
That power was supposed to fulfill everything.
But hesitation is uncalled for if it's to protect your dearest.
Next time, Fullmetal Alchemist:
Episode 63, The Other Side of the Gate.
He fades away after overseeing all.
Shoot everyone except for Colonel Mustang!
By that,
are you implying that the Madam may be shot as well?
Those are words I wanted to hear, but...
I...
No, was my husband abandoned by his country?
Or perhaps, did he abandon me?
I can't say for sure.
But you can rest assured that we'll insure your safety.
In order to prove after everything is over that what we are currently doing is not in the wrong.
Reinforcements!
Hurry!
Looks like you were saved.
Had we been soldiers from Briggs, you would have been dead.
What?!
Long time no see, Colonel.
Yeah. Good work.
What's Lieutenant General Grumman up to?
He's dealing with the aftermath of the train explosion.
Have you not mentioned to the Madam that her husband is currently missing?
I haven't.
It would be hard to move around if she were to pass out from the shock.
They're gathering like ants.
You're too popular, Colonel.
You're telling me...
You still haven't taken care of them?!
What are they doing?!
There are only five enemies!
They've increased in numbers!
Apparently, they're currently at least the size of a platoon!
Our casualties?
59 injured, no deaths, sir!
None?
Damn them...
Are you alright?!
Just barely...
The Flame Alchemist is the one who was devastating in Ishbal, right?
Am I the only one who feels like he's not as powerful as the rumors say?
Agreed.
All I've been seeing from him are tiny explosion flames...
Jess! Parkie!
Dammit! He got my eardrum!
What are the casualties?!
5 injured, no deaths!
We're lucky that none were killed.
Both the hero of Ishbal and the "Hawk's Eye" are against us.
It's strange that none of our men have died.
It couldn't be...!
They really are!
They're...!
Going easy on us?!
Yes.
There are quite a few casualties, but none have been killed so far.
Even the ones who were sniped were not hit in critical spots.
Mocking us like that...!
Have the Demetri Squad and Kim Squad deployed as well!
Hurry up and make a stack of the corpses of Mustang's men right here!
They still haven't captured Mustang?
What in the world is Brigadier General Clemin doing?!
Apparently, they're only chipping at our forces without killing any of them.
There's no way they can keep up something that crafty for so long.
Colonel Mustang sure is soft.
Seriously.
What the hell is he thinking?
And the Central Army who can't even defeat him are even more inexperienced.
It's almost like child's play.
What did you say?
I've heard that headquarters was almost completely frozen by a single traitor.
Central has never been attacked by a large force since the country was established.
This inexperience is its greatest weakness.
Good on the offensive, but absolutely terrible on the defensive.
What do you think?
How about you put me in charge of the Central Army for a bit?
Don't get too cocky, Armstrong!
Do you think you're here right now because of your own ability?
You're only here so that we can control you.
We're aware that you and the soldiers at Briggs have a strong bond.
The fact that you're here is a powerful shackle on their wrists to prevent them from opposing us.
You guys don't know anything about us!
I've told them beforehand to abandon me in the event of an emergency.
The law of Briggs is "Survival of the Fittest".
Even if I were to die here, they'd only shrug it off and say it happened because I was too weak.
They're a group that will move on without flinching.
That's what it means to be a soldier at Briggs.
Don't you dare speak of the soldiers I raised without actually knowing them!
They're currently exchanging fire with Colonel Mustang and the crew in the industrial area in the west district.
A lot of soldiers were sent to that area.
Let's do this.
Time to say goodbye to this cellar.
Give those cowards at Central a good bite in the windpipe!
See? Here they come.
Veterans who can put up a fight against the giant bears at Briggs.
I wonder who'd win; them or those proud dolls of yours?
Dammit!
New forces?!
That's ridiculous!
Where did they come from?!
They just suddenly appeared from within the city!
They're not magicians, dammit!
You men go too!
Enemy numbers?
Unconfirmed, sir!
But from their equipment, we can assume that they're from the north!
Briggs...?
From the Armstrong's mansion?
Yeah.
We snuck soldiers and weapons into the basement while the mansion was being repaired.
How big is the place, exactly?
Charlie!
Give me some ammo!
Sorry, we're out too.
This is bad...
What's taking the supply squad so long?
Don't tell me they were captured...
If things get really bad, desert me and run.
Roger that!
Isn't this where you're supposed to say, "I'll follow you to the depths of hell"?
Last thing I want to do is to commit double suicide with a guy.
I've got a wife waiting for me at home, too.
Oh...
...really?
Th-They've started using less bullets on us.
I'm assuming they're just about out of ammo.
Okay, let's wrap this up!
Gather everyone that's left!
Hey, Riza!
You're late, Rebecca!
My bad, my bad!
So for those of you who waited so patiently...
I've got a few gifts to hand out!
Amazing...
Not just ammo, but all this too?!
Nice, Rebecca! I love you!
Shut up!
Men without money have no right to hit on me!
Here.
Yeah. Thanks.
It's been a while, Colonel Mustang.
Second Lieutenant Maria Ross, returning without permission, sir!
Why aren't they rushing in?
They can't approach carelessly because we have the Flame Alchemist on our side!
But the Colonel can't go all out because we're in the middle of the city.
Oh my.
I came to Central to find hot guys, but it seems like they're all nothing but cowards!
Shit!
Tear-gas grenades from Xing,
packed with red peppers!
You got all of these from Xing?!
I hadn't heard that you were a part of the mission.
You procured all these weapons by yourself?
Or was it on someone else's orders...
Would you like to speak with him?
We're good to go!
Here.
Some important person from Xing, perhaps?
This is Roy Mustang, a colonel in the state military.
I'm terribly grateful for-
What are you acting all polite for?
Come on, Colonel. Just chat like we always used to.
Eighty years at your service.
Anything from underwear elastics to armored vehicles.
Just one call, and we'll have it delivered to you. Anytime, anywhere.
Your friendly neighborhood Havoc General Store!
Havoc!
So, where's the money?
I'll pay up after I'm successful.
Keep it on my tab.
There's smoke rising from the city.
I can faintly hear the sound of an alarm, also.
Looks like the Colonel and the men from Briggs have begun to make their move.
Central must be in a state of pandemonium right now.
Guess it's time to go.
Yeah.
We've prepared the counter for the Nationwide Transmutation Circle,
but it wouldn't hurt to stop it before it's activated.
He's basically just like how he was in the flask, but bigger.
If you destroy his container, he should perish.
We'll... also be able to free the souls of the ones that are bound inside him.
But how do we get to him?
We're going to use the underground path I took with May in the past.
There are tons of deadly chimera, but we should be able to get through with our current party.
You stay here, Heinkel.
Okay.
Sorry about this.
Not your fault.
Doctor Marcoh, make sure the military doesn't find you.
Yoki!
You wait here too.
G-Gladly.
Al.
Yeah, Brother?
I'm going to go out for a sec to beat the hell out of a certain bearded nuisance.
Be careful.
You got it.
It seems like there's something going on...
I'd hurry if I were you.
Father should be revealing the secret to immortality soon.
I know that!
We're going to form a cordon here!
Don't let Mustang's group or the Briggs soldiers past the line!
Have your soldiers retreat immediately!
You all are the ones who took away my right to command Briggs.
You...!
Do you think you're getting away with this?!
Let me redirect that question right back to you.
You've heard from that 'Father' guy, haven't you?
What you're going to sacrifice and what you're going to gain.
Yes, of course.
We the chosen ones will climb to a new height,
and Amestris will change the world!
Change must be accompanied by pain.
Is it really that hard to understand?!
You pigs are beyond all hope.
What?
You cowards who hide in the rear lines and glance over the battlefield...
...like to pass off 'pain' as if it were something noble, and proceed to make use of it.
Are you planning to turn traitor?!
I don't know about that.
I may have become a heroine instead, after everything's over.
However...!
I'm not as soft as the hero of Ishbal.
W-Wait!
What?!
Sir!
Major Armstrong!
Sergeant Brosh.
Don't you have the day off today?
I rushed here after seeing smoke from my window.
What happened?
Colonel Mustang and his former men are holding the FÃ¼hrer President's wife hostage,
and are currently on the run in the city.
What?
That coward!
First, he kills the innocent Second Lieutenant Ross, and now he kidnaps the Madam?
He's a devil in the shape of a human!
Major!
In the meeting room at headquarters, Major General Armstrong killed Lieutenant General Gardner by...
Shot to death?!
Okay.
Seems like things are moving faster than I'd imagined.
I need to find the young master soon.
However, I can't sense him because the giant flow of energy underground is interfering...
Huh?
It feels like the energy underground has spread more so than yesterday...
This won't do.
The soldiers are gathered right in front of it, and we can't approach.
It'll be a bit tough to force our way through.
There's another entrance!
Research Laboratory 3!
Al and the Colonel have infiltrated there before and ended up fighting against the homunculi!
Three guards, huh?
Okay, let's do this.
No no, this is the time for me to use my position.
Soldiers!
I'm Edward Elric, a State Alchemist!
Huh?
A State Alchemist, sir?!
Please, help me!
I'm being chased by Scar!
He's a wanted man!
Freeze!
You're terrible.
Shut up, let's go.
Yeah yeah, coming through.
I think it was around here...
Here it is!
Should we split up?
Yeah.
I'll go this way.
Edward and Scar go the other way.
What?!
Why do I have to go with him?!
If you try to distribute strength alchemy-wise, this would be best.
Besides, when the enemy sealed alchemy,
Scar was able to use it but you couldn't do anything, right?
Okay, then these two should go together.
What about the rest of us?
I'm not your average Joe, so I'll be fine on my own.
But, well...
I guess I'll take this lady from Xing as my bodyguard.
Okay, so if you see him,
give it your all to destroy him.
Roger!
Will you guys really be all right with just the two of you?
Of course.
Besides, old men prefer being alone with young women.
What a pervert.
Let's go already.
You need to find the Prince of Xing, right?
Go.
Er, but...
Don't worry about us.
He means a lot to you, doesn't he?
Thank you.
Seriously, what pathetic fools!
They can't even fight properly against those monkeys from Briggs?!
Please, wait!
We haven't finished experimenting with the soul attachment process yet!
Shut it!
When would be a better time to use them than now?!
We've created so many philosopher's stones for situations like this!
Now, move!
Devour those traitors!
Souls that once dwelled inside humans now dwell inside puppets and are lurching forth.
Although their appearances are deformed, their souls are indeed human.
Next time, Fullmetal Alchemist:
Episode 51, An Immortal Army.
Should they be defeated, or should they be spared?So you're suggesting Major General Armstrong had a hand in Lieutenant General Raven's disappearance?
Most likely.
But I'm sure she left no evidence.
You're right.
Ah, well. Our job is to take over this fort...
...while that fox is being investigated in Central by a herd of tigers.
Oh, if it isn't the Major General.
I still can't believe you were transferred to Central.
What connections did you use?
I believe it's simply an honest display of my capabilities.
Says the fresh meat.
What brings you here today?
I've been summoned by the FÃ¼hrer President.
I may not be able to return to Briggs for a while.
"For a while"?
Then I'm going to have to take you to dinner at least once.
Is it your treat?
If you'll let me eat until you go bankrupt, I don't mind going for dinner.
I guess I'll give up on the meal, then...
Both your wallet and your balls are pea-sized, I see.
How about some flowers instead?
There are many great florists in Central, after all.
I see.
You may enter.
Yes, sir.
Now, Major General Armstrong...
...let me hear more aboutLieutenant General Raven's disappearance.
What did you do?
I won't be able to hide this.
Why would a man as great as you choose to place a fool like Raven by his side?
So you got rid of him?
You don't need him.
Having a subordinate with such a loose tongue would do you no good.
What did Lieutenant General Raven tell you?
Something about an immortal army...
...the history of this country, and your real identity.
He told me many things I didn't even ask for.
So you still chose to respond tomy summons after hearing all that?
Yes, to request the seat the idiot had been placing his ass on.
Interesting, as expected of you.
Very well. You may have the position.
In exchange, I'll have one of my men govern over Briggs. Are you fine with this?
As you wish, sir.
They are powerful soldiers I trained with great care.
I'm sure you'll like them.
Interesting. Do your best, human.
"Nothing ventured, nothing gained."
So the Major General ventured into the enemy's lair by her own will.
Yeah. This place also belongs to them now.
But they're unaware...
...Briggs is a giant monolith that can act with a united will, even if its master happens to be away.
From here on, it's a war between bears and tigers.
Episode 40, Homunculus.
Is that seat free?
Yes.
How's your work progressing?
As you can see,
I can't finish everything unless I multitask during my meals, as well.
And you?
There's so much to memorize; I'm fairly busy.
But the FÃ¼hrer President does his job very quickly, so I do not have to worry about that.
He doesn't loaf either, unlike a certain someone.
I have a feeling this topic is heading in a direction I don't like.
That reminds me...
Scar is apparently up north.
So are the Elric brothers.
I see.
My old classmates, Lucy and Ian, are also up north.
They tell me many things.
If I recall, the north and the east will be holding joint exercises in the spring.
Yes, we've been defeated countless times by Major Miles and Captain Buccaneer.
Miles... Buccaneer...
York, Ida, and Sugar, too.
Havoc, Oscar, Mike, Uni, Nora, Charley...
Uni again, then Lucy...
Uni comes again, then next... is Sterling!
"Selim Bradley is homunculus".
I guess there's no way that 
Just what is about to happen here in Central?
Boy.
Hey, you over there.
Oh, crap!
Don't worry.
Over here.
What the hell?
Come on.
Aren't you at least a little surprised?
If I do get surprised, will you give me something?
I guess you're always at ease. I like you.
What's your name?
Slave Number 23.
I didn't ask for a number. I want your real name.
I don't have a name. I'm a slave.
Slave?
People who are stripped of their rights and freedom, and are exchanged as possessions in conveyance?
Conveyance?
To transfer property and rights and such.
You're not very bright, are you?
Shut up!
I don't understand how I was born from someone like you.
You're the one who gave me blood, aren't you?
They did take a lot of blood from me to use for experiments...
I was born because you gave me blood.
Thank you. Umm...
"Slave Number 23" just sounds too cold.
I'll give you a name, then.
Who the hell do you think you are?
Don't you want a cool name? Let's see...
Teo... Teofrastus Bombastus.
Too long.
Ah, it can't be too long; else you won't be able to memorize it. You're dumb, after all.
Quit saying that!
Then how about Van?
Van Hohenheim.
Van Hohen, eh?
I should be able to remember that.
You spell it like...
Wait, do you know how to read and write?
I don't need to know to work.
The work of a slave, right?
Don't you want freedom and rights?
Do you plan on ending your life as a slave without gaining basic human rights?
That's the same as being in this stuffy flask.
I'm going to share my knowledge with you, Van Hohenheim.
Hey... What 
What should I call you?
The Little One Inside the Flask. So... call me "Homunculus".
All was created from one, and it eventually returns to one.
In other words, one is all.
All exists due to one...
...and all exists within one.
If one does not contain all, then there exists nothing.
You pass.
You're now a fine alchemist, Hohenheim.
I'm still not good enough to be on my own.
My abilities are far beneath yours, Master.
You know, I'm really thankful.
For what?
Because you gave me knowledge,I'm able to live a good life like this.
I'm also happy to be in Master's favor.
It may be possible that I can marry someone in the future and start my own family.
A family, eh?
Humans are inconvenient creatures, aren't they?
The species can't live on unless they all create a community and expand.
Don't talk like that.
It may be stupid in your eyes,but having friends and family...
...may bring one happiness.
For us humans, that is.
Really?
Then what do you consider happiness?
Let's see...
I don't want to be too greedy, but I guess being able to leave this flask would make me happy.
Immortality...
I wonder why fools who gained ultimate authority and prosperity begin to wish for that.
Mind your tongue!
You're talking to the King!
If you continue to be disrespectful, I'll break the flask!
You're going to destroy the source of the knowledge you don't know about?
Cease your prattling.
Can you make me immortal or not?
Growing impatient as you age, huh?
How sad, King of Xerxes.
Fine, I'll tell you how to achieve immortality.
What's with the construction?
We're making a waterway for irrigation.
The King ordered a waterway to extend around the entire country.
Nothing less to be expected from the King of Xerxes.
He even thinks about commoners like us.
That's right.
Kill them all. Understood?
Yes, sir!
Hurry! Waste no time!
Hurry and carve a bloody crest into the land!
The village to the north was raided?
I heard everyone there was killed.
And the same thing happened in the village to the west last time.
I wonder who's behind it...
How terrible.
Yeah, how awful.
Your Majesty, the transmutation circle is finally complete.
Truly, it has been a long time.
This is all we need to do, right?
Yeah, you'll be able to become immortal.
That's amazing.
The King is going to become immortal.
I guess it's what they call the turning point of the century.
So this is immortality...
What's this?!
You said that since we're in the center of it, we wouldn't be harmed!
What?
What's happening?!
Hey! Homunculus!
The true center of the transmutation circle is where you're standing right now.
What?!
I opened the gate using your blood inside of me.
You're a relative that shares my blood, Hohenheim!
Right now, you and I are at the center of the world!
Your Majesty!
Master!
He's dead.
Is anyone here?!
Willard!
Mechthild!
Linemile!
Tony!
Meiyou!
Please... Someone, say something.
It's no use. Everyone has had their souls taken from them.
Your Majesty!
You were all right...
So...
...How do you like your new body?
It's... me...
I created a body for myself usingthe information stored in your blood.
Finally, I can walk with my own two feet.
You're... Homunculus?
What is this?! What did you do?!
In return for you giving me blood, I gave you a name and shared my knowledge with you.
I also gave you an eternal body.
Eternal?
Try focusing all of your consciousness into yourself.
Can't you hear the voices?
The voices of all the people, who lived in this country, sacrificed for your immortal body.
Well, half of them went to me.
Thanks for your help, Hohenheim.
Mr. Hohenheim?
It really 
Wow, I didn't know you were Ed and Al's father.
I didn't expect you to be the master of my sons, either...
I hear you did a lot for them.
No, not at all.
Miss Izumi?
Are you all right, Izumi?!
I'll get your medicine...
Let me take a look at her.
I know a thing or two about medicine.
Don't worry, this isn't anything new.
This is certainly something to worry about.
Mr. Sig, please get a cab.
Hurry!
R-Right!
Miss Izumi...
You saw the truth, didn't you?
What did you sacrifice?
Please don't try to hide it.
They took a few of my organs.
I tried to revive my dead baby.
I see.
I see...
If you'll excuse me.
Izumi! Hang in there!
Izumi!
Calm down, Dear. I'm fine.
You were stabbed in the stomach!
But I can breathe more easily now.
Show me your wound.
There's no wound.
That can't be!
The organs that were taken are the proof of your sins, so I can't bring them back.
But I rearranged your insides a bit to ease the flow of blood.
Miss Izumi, you can't die just yet.
Hohenheim...
Just... what exactly 
I'm a human by the name of Van Hohenheim...
A philosopher's stone in human form.
The philosopher's stone,the heavenly stone, the great elixir.
Just like how the philosopher's stone has many names,
its form isn't always that of a stone.
The one Doctor Marcoh had was almost like a gel.
Kimblee's looked like a crystal, and it was about this big.
Since it possesses so much energy, I pictured something far larger...
I've never seen one bigger than a pebble.
If it's something even larger, that would mean an enormous number of humans was used to create it.
I'd rather not see one.
If one wishes to gain something,one must present something of equal value.
That is the principle behind alchemy.
It is also the principle behind everything else.
Next time, Fullmetal Alchemist:
Episode 41, Hell.
His softness seeks pain from the boy as an equal exchange.Don't you desire freedom and rights, Hohenheim?
Do you plan to let your life end as a slave,
without even obtaining your basic rights as a human?
If so, you might as well be living in this stuffy flask.
Episode 63, The Other Side of the Gate.
Why?!
All right!
Finish him, Ed!
Why am I, someone who has obtained God,
being defeated by the bare hands...
...of a mere human alchemist?
He did it!
All right!
You showed him!
Man the fuck up!
Why are you getting swept away?!
M-My bad!
Stone...
Philosopher's stone!!
Give me your philosopher's stone!
Shit!
Greed!!
Idiot, you're going to get yourself dragged in!
Let go!
I refuse!
In order for me to become the Emperor, I need you!
That's just impossible!
I was born from Father to begin with.
The force that's pulling me toward him is stronger than the one pulling me toward Ling Yao!
Nothing can be done!
Don't give up, Greed!
Keep trying!
Shit!
My body...!
God dammit!!
Well, it's a few ranks lower than being the king of the world,
but I guess I wouldn't mind becoming the Emperor of Xing.
We're gonna fight together, partner.
That's the spirit!
What are you...
And this is goodbye.
There's no need for you to be absorbed by him along with me.
H-Hang on, Greed!
You just said that we were going to fight together!
This is foul play, dammit!
I thought you never told lies!
You can't let it end like this!
You totally fell for it though, shitty brat!
That was my first and final lie.
Lan Fan has a philosopher's stone with her.
Take it home with you, kid.
Wait...
Wait!
Wait, Greed!!
Come, Lan Fan!
Peace.
Greed!
Greed!!
Curse you, Greed!!
I was able to free myself from an annoying brat.
Why do you revolt against your father, Greed?!
Just going through a late puberty, pops.
With this carbonization ability you gave me,
I'll turn us into the most brittle form of carbon, charcoal!
You little...!
Begone, fool!
Greed!!
Damn, I guess this is it...
Take a look in the damn mirror, brat.
Friends are connected by the soul!
There's no way you'd forget!
Want to join us?
If you've got nowhere else to go, come with us.
Man, both Ling and the midget totally made a fool out of me.
That was plenty...
Yeah, that was enough for me...
I don't need anything else...
Peace out, soul... brothers...
You guys...
My stones...
My philosopher's stones...
W-What?
What is this?!
Go back to where you were born,
Dwarf in the Flask, Homunculus!
Why?!
I wanted to learn everything about this world!
I wanted to live freely in this vast world without being bound by anyone!
I...!
Why?!
Why won't you become mine?!
God, what are you unhappy with?!
Because you don't believe in yourself.
You were born from humans after stealing other's power,
and yet, you were just clinging on to God the entire time.
You haven't grown up at all.
Did you think you'd be able to surpass humans if you let go of your seven desires?
Don't make me laugh!
I wanted to become a perfect being!
I wanted to learn everything about this world!
What's wrong with wanting that?!
What's wrong with desiring it?!
What's wrong with wishing for it?!
Who...
Who the hell are you?!
Who?!
Who the hell do you think you are?!
I'm the existence which you all refer to as "The World."
And "Universe," and "God,"
and "Truth," and "All," and "One."
And I am also yourself.
Truth is what gives one the most fitting form of despair to insure them not to become conceited.
He gives humans the most fitting form of despair to make sure humans don't become conceited.
That is Truth.
Thus, I'll also give you despair.
I don't want to go back!
No!
Stop! I don't want to be bound there forever!
No! No!
No!!
Despair to the ones who become swelled with pride.
What else should I have done?!
This is the end you desired.
What should I have done?!
You probably foresaw the answer.
What? What happened?
Did we win?
Yes.
But... Alphonse has yet to come back from the other side.
I'm... I'm so sorry...!
It's not your fault.
It was Al's decision.
Ed, we have a toll.
Use it, it's a philosopher's stone.
Use this to get Al back.
I can't.
We promised we'd never use a philosopher's stone to get our bodies back.
There has to be another way.
There HAS to be.
Think...!
Think!
Don't stop thinking!
Edward.
Use my life to bring Alphonse back.
I've got just enough life left for one.
Idiot!
There's no way I could do something like that!
It's our own fault that we lost our bodies!
I've said so many times that we won't use other's lives to get Al back!
Besides, why the hell do YOU have to give your life up?!
Because I'm your father.
It's not about needs or reasoning.
You two are precious to me.
I want the both of you to live happily.
I'm partially to blame for what happened to your bodies, since I left you to care for yourselves.
I'm sorry.
I've lived enough.
Let me do something father-like for just this last time.
Don't be ridiculous, you good-for-nothing dad!
Don't ever say something like that again!
I'll punch you!
I'm sorry, Edward...
Think...!
Think!
Aren't I supposed to be the youngest State Alchemist of all time?!
I can use alchemy without a transmutation circle because I saw Truth, right?!
There has to be a way!
There has to be!
I'm sure a lot of people are waiting for the day when you two get your bodies back.
If there's a possibility, you should move forward.
That's right. Don't give up.
There... There has to be something.
Something!
Sir Al...
Sir Al...!
Sir Al!
May is crying so much for Al...
Zampano, Donkey Kong, and everyone from Briggs...
Major, Ling, Lan Fan...
Master, Dad...
May, step away for a sec.
That's...!
A human transmutation circle!
I'll be right back.
The last transmutation that the Fullmetal Alchemist will ever do.
Ed!
Ed!
Edward Elric!
So you came to get your brother back.
But how are you going to drag an entire human out?
What will you sacrifice?
Your entire body?
There's something huge right here that I can sacrifice.
This is MY Gate of Truth.
Which means I can do whatever I want with it.
Am I wrong?
So that was your plan.
But are you sure about that?
If you lose your Gate of Truth,you'll never be able to use alchemy again.
Yeah...
You're right, all of alchemy is on the other side of this gate.
But thanks to it, I was manipulated.
I was shown the Truth, and believed that I could solve everything with alchemy.
But I was wrong.
I was just being arrogant.
You're going to become an ordinary human who can't use alchemy?
I'm not going to "become" anything. I've always been an ordinary human.
I'm a puny human who couldn't even save a girl who was turned into a chimera.
So you're sure you don't mind getting rid of that?
Ed!
Fullmetal!
Edward!
Ed!
Edward Elric!
Ed!
Mr. Edward!
Ed!
Ed!
Even if I lose alchemy, I'll still have my friends.
Correct, alchemist!
You've defeated me.
Take everything you want!
The back door is over that way,
Edward Elric.
You were so reckless.
Ditto.
Okay, let's go back. Together.
Yeah.
Hey, he's awake!
You okay, Alphonse?
Mr. Zampano and Mr. Darius...
Everyone...
Dad!
Yo, welcome back.
Yup.
Glad to be back.
So warm...
Sir Al...
Sir Alphonse!
May!
I... I...!
That's right, I'm sorry.
I made you do something you didn't want to do.
Thanks, May.
To those who are listening to Radio Capital:
Today, the squadrons led by Major General Armstrong and Colonel Mustang
captured Central Headquarters, assembly, and so on.
This was all in order to halt the actions of the upper echelon of the army;
they were planning a massive alchemy experiment that would sacrifice a great number of our citizens.
Out of the masterminds who were planning on carrying out this evil experiment,
Brigadier General Clemin and Brigadier General Edison were captured,
and the soldiers who used to be under their command were disarmed.
FÃ¼hrer President King Bradley and his son, Selim,
lost their lives in the midst of the confusion.
Colonel Mustang has voiced his intention to carry on the will of the FÃ¼hrer President and to keep our nation safe,
and that he'll consult with all whom it may concern about future measures.
You're the one who gave me blood, right?
Don't you desire freedom and rights, Hohenheim?
Then what does happiness mean to you?
Let's see... I won't ask for anything too extravagant,
but I guess I'd be happy if I could somehow leave this flask.
You're right, Dwarf in the Flask, Homunculus.
You were born from my blood.
I...
Sir Hohenheim.
Both of your children have been safely hospitalized.
Thank you. I appreciate it.
No, I should be the one thanking you.
Edward Elric and Alphonse Elric.
If it weren't for those two boys, this country would have fallen.
Thank you very much.
Thanks.
I'm home, Trisha.
Edward called me "Dad."
Though there was a "good-for-nothing" in front of it.
I always thought that it would be backbreaking to continue living longer than everyone else.
But by meeting you and our sons,
I was able to truly appreciate the fact that I was alive, from the bottom of my heart.
It was a fulfilling life.
Yeah... it was more than enough.
Thank you, Trisha.
But...
...somehow, I still want to live.
I really am a good-for-nothing.
Hohenheim!
What, you came home?
Idiot...
I've never seen a dead person look so happy.
































What comes after the endâ¦
Is a beginning.
A future filled with hope must be created with one's own hands.
Next time, Fullmetal Alchemist:
Finale, The End of a Journey.
Take a step forward into the world called "life."
Hey! Anyone here?!
Answer me, Al!!
Where the hell am I?!
Dammit...
Ling!
Stupid prince!
Who are you calling stupid?
Ling!
Is that any way to speak to a prince?
You're safe!
You...
What?
You're not actually Envy disguised as Ling, are you?
Come on...
Do you want me to recite the entire room service menu?!
Okay, you're not fake.
You're not a fake either, are you? You pea--
Who are you calling a pea-sized runt?!
Okay, you pass.
Episode 25, The Door of Darkness.
But seriously, where are we?
If I recall, we were swallowed up by Gluttony, and...
Yeah, but there's no way his stomach could be this big.
But...
Look.
It's the deserted house we were just in.
And this...
The Lieutenant's car?
I think it's safe to assume that all this fire came from the Colonel.
Yeah.
Which means...
...we're really inside Gluttony's stomach?
No idea.
But I can at least tell you we're not in Heaven.
Let me see this.
What's up?
Ling, look at this.
Isn't that Al's?
If we can only find his arm,that means Al wasn't swallowed with us.
Thank goodness.
I bet Al is worried sick.
We've got no idea where we are, either.
Now's the perfect time for them to awaken!My telepathic abilities!
Elric telepathy!
Hear me, Brother!
Have fun with that.
I see a lot of buildings and corpses,but they're all from different times...
Is there even an exit to this place?
I don't know. And if there isn't, I'll make one.
And where are you going to make one?
All right, throw that stick in.
I see what you're up to.
There.
I don't think it's hit the bottom yet...
A wall! Let's look for a wall!
Yeah! No matter how big the place is, we'll eventually reach the edge if we just keep moving forward!
We should be able to find the exit, too!
I couldn't find her...
Where did you go, Shao May?
Maybe it got eaten up by a stray dog or something?
A stray?
That was a joke! I'm sorry!
She...
Shao May is a panda who has had a minor disorder since birth, which prevented her from getting any bigger.
I found her after she was abandoned by her parents...
...and we've been raised like sisters ever since.
My clan, the Chang, barely has any authority in Xing, making us one of the weakest clans.
Maybe that's why.
How can I put it... we were both attracted to each other because of our similar standings...
Yes. It may have been sympathy at first...
...but we were raised like family, carried the same burdens...
...and she eventually became someone irreplaceable to me.
There are lots of things I was able to go through, just because she was there.
I wouldn't have been able to cross the desert without her.
I don't think you really had to cross it in the first place.
Why would you do all this for something uncertain like immortality?
If I don't bring back the method of immortality...If I don't present it to the Emperor and earn his favor...
My clan will die out at this rate.
That's why I came here with her...
With her...
Shao May!
Stop crying! I'm begging you!
Master.
We still have some time before the sun rises.
There shouldn't be a lot of military police on-duty at this time.
Huh?!
You'll help me look for her?
You're such a nice person.
His people died out in that civil war.
So maybe he's empathizing with you and your weak clan?
What's wrong? Aren't you going to look for her?
Okay! I'm coming!
Having to walk in all this really drains your stamina, doesn't it...
Yeah. And no signs of an exit, either...
I'm so hungry...
If we manage to get out, I'll let you eat all you want.
Eat all you want, sleep all you want, and...
Ling?
I can't take this anymore...
Come on, giving up already?
You're pathetic.
You going to collapse here, too?!
Get up! Walk!
I'm leaving you behind, dammit!
Then go...
You weakling!
I'm going!
I can't die here.
I'm really going to go ahead!
Not joking, you know!
Didn't you say you were going to go ahead?
I definitely don't want to die with you.
But you've got people waiting for you, too, don't you?
Hey, if you have the strength to talk, then...
If only we had something to eat...
Did you know, Ling?
Leather goods are edible.
Should be done by now...
Here.
You don't have athlete's foot, do you?
Do I look like I do, dumbass?!
What a meal.
Sorry about all this.
What do you mean?
If you hadn't tried to save me back then...
Forget it.
This is nothing compared to the training I went through as a kid.
It's kind of annoying we don't know where we are,
but we can search for the exit now that we've had our beans.
An optimist, are you?
I'm just relentless about staying alive.
If I even thought about giving up,I'd get beaten and scolded by Al.
What's wrong?
Something's coming.
That's...
Oh, it's you guys.
Envy, just as I thought!
Please, tell us where the exit is!
That's pathetic, Edward Elric!
Shut up! Humans would do anything to live!
Despicable!
Unfortunately...
Shut up!
You're despicable!
...there's no exit.
Shut up! Shut up!
You really had to do that, didn't you?
Even I got dragged in because of you.
Where are we?
Are we really inside Gluttony's stomach?
We're inside his stomach, and at the same time, we're not.
Fullmetal ru-
I mean, Fullmetal Alchemist, shouldn't you have realized where we are by now?
Now that you mention it,when I was sucked in by Gluttony...
I recognize that sensation...
Don't you?
Since you've gone through it in the past.
The Gate of Truth!
But this isn't how it was.
It was all white, and there was a gate...
Oh, so that's how the real one is.
"Real"?
Gluttony is the result of Father's unsuccessful attempt at recreating the Gate of Truth.
What... did you say?
A poorly-made Gate of Truth that even Father couldn't get right.
I guess it's safe to call this place the crevice between reality and the truth.
The crevice?!
There's no exit, nor a way to get out of here.
All we can do now is to wait untilthe span of our lives comes to an end.
All we can do...
...is wait until we die here.
No...
No way in hell I'll let that happen!
Don't screw around with me!
Envy!
Hey!
There's no exit?
We're going to die here?
Hey... Hey...
Hang on.
If I die here, what will Al do?
I promised him...
I promised him we'd get our bodies back together.
Dammit!
Who the hell is this Father guy that tried to recreate the Gate?!
FÃ¼hrer President Bradley?!
Bradley?
Not even close.
He's just a homunculus.
I knew it...
Research Laboratory 5.
Using people's lives.
Philosopher's stones.
Homunculus.
If the FÃ¼hrer President is also a homunculus, then that means it was you guys who started the Ishbal conflict...
Ishbal?!
That was the most amusing task I'd ever been given!
Do you know what started that civil war in the first place?
If I recall, an army officer accidentally killed an Ishbalan child...
That's right.
I'm the one who shot the kid dead.
Umm...
I heard about Ishbal from Yoki.
That felt amazing.
Watching the civil war spread indefinitely from a single bullet.
Man, it was really refreshing!
Oh, by the way.
I disguised myself as a moderate officer who was against the military intervention of Ishbal.
Hear this!
He couldn't even give an excuse for it and was sentenced to death by court-martial!
Humans are so easy to manipulate.
So it was you...
The one who shot an innocent child dead...
The one who destroyed our hometown... The one who drove away the Ishbalans...
The one who created Scar, a vengeful murderer...
The root cause...
...of what killed Winry's parents...
You bastard!!!
What?
He didn't give an inch...
You brats want to fight?
Ed, pull back!
We're all going to die here anyway.
I'll show you something cool as a final gift.
Did you look beneath his feet when you were fighting him in the woods?
No.
That means...
He may not look like it, but he weighs quite a bit.
His true form must be...
Dammit...
What the hell is this?!
How could that be a homunculus...
An artificial human?!
What...
...should I do?
Hell if I know.
What should I do... I'll...
I'll get yelled at by Father!
Father? You have a dad?
I do.
The one who created the homunculi?
Yes.
What happens to the mass you swallow...
Is there a trick to it?
Think... Think!
We decided we'd get our bodies back together!
I can't give up here!
Gluttony, take me to your Father.
Okay.
You're a human sacrifice, right?
Y-Yeah, that's right. I'm a human sacrifice!
What the heck does he mean by that?
The only ones currently confirmed as such are the Elric brothers.
What about Doctor Marcoh?
You would think that it's about time...
There's Kimblee, too.
He doesn't have the nerve to open the Gate.
Well, what about Mustang, the other sacrifice candidate?
The FÃ¼hrer President wants to have a long chat with him.
Why are you letting me live?
To make you understand where you stand.
Since when has the military been beholden to the homunculi?
It has been set up that way ever since this country was first reformed.
So you've been smiling with glee, watching us struggle.
Your hands that were shaking during Brigadier General Hughes' funeral...
Was that just an act?!
Everyone makes too big a deal out of the death of a soldier.
They should have known his military uniform might become his burial attire.
Brigadier General Hughes' daughter was so annoying during the funeral.
She really got on my nerves.
If I recall, you also have a child.
How could you say such a thing?
Are you referring to Selim?
He's a good boy.
I wonder how he'd react if he were to find out that his father, a man of utmost standing, is a homunculus.
Are you trying to blackmail me?
It is futile.
He won't become my weakness.
But you're different.
She'll become your weakness.
Lieutenant Hawkeye!
What is it?
Someone from the personnel bureau dropped by earlier.
I was transferred to Southern Headquarters.
What?!
Not just me, either.
Second Lieutenant Breda was transferred to Western Headquarters,
and Warrant Officer Falman was transferred to Northern Headquarters.
You're Lieutenant Hawkeye, correct?
Yes, sir.
I'm Yakovleff, from the personnel bureau.
Personnel bureau...
I'm Shtolhi, an assistant to the FÃ¼hrer President.
Take this.
Is this a transfer order?
Correct.
Please allow me to review it.
This is...
What is with this insane personnel change?!
Where were you assigned?
"Starting tomorrow, Lieutenant Riza Hawkeye will be stationed at Central Headquarters..."
"...as an assistant to the FÃ¼hrer President."
And that's how it is.
Colonel Roy Mustang.
How delightful!
Damn, this isn't delightful at all.
Not the least bit.
Ling!
Ed!
Can you make a weapon?
Leave it to me!
We're in a sea of blood.
There's plenty of iron here!
You have bad taste.
How so? I think it looks cool.
Can you do it?
I don't know...
Look at that figure.
And to top it off, that earlier attack broke a few of my ribs.
Same here.
But I won't be satisfied until I give him a good beatdown!
Gluttony, are you sure we're going the right way?
Yeah.
But this way... we're headed toward...
Your Father is in Central?!
Is the soul acting in the shadows a guidepost to the future?
Fight, boy,

Next time, Fullmetal Alchemist:
Episode 26, Reunion.
I won't say farewell...
...because I believe we'll meet again.But I'm amazed you were able to come back alive after seeing that thing.
To be expected of my student, I guess.
That's...
But rules are rules.
You're expelled.
Master-
Al.
The trains are still running.
Go home.
Thanks... for everything.

Drop by if you're ever in the neighborhood.
But we're...
Idiot!
If you aren't in a master-student relationship anymore,
it means that from now on,you're going to treat each other as individuals.
What's holding you back?
Dammit!
Al! What did we come to Dublith for?
Mr. Sig, we're going to head back!
Don't let her kill you.
Master!
What did you come back for?!
Who are you calling Master?!
You guys aren't my students anymore!
Go home already!
Master!
We came here to find clues on how to get our bodies back.
We can't go back with nothing.
Go home!
We won't!
Morons...
You didn't see the truth, did you, Al?
No. I have no idea what you mean...
Maybe you lost your memories due to shock.
How about we try retrieving your memories?
You had your whole body taken.
There's no way you didn't see it.
I get it!

So if we can get my memories back, we might find a clue on how to get our bodies back...
But memories of that thing, huh?
That thing, huh?
Huh? Could this be bad?
More like... extraordinary?
Yeah, you could call it that.
Your mind might explode...
If you screw up, it could destroy you...
But if it'll let us find a clue...
I want to do it!
Fine.
Let me ask a friend of mine how to regain one's memories.
But before that, let's eat.
You'd better help out.
Yes, ma'am!
No doubt about it. That's the guy who affixed a soul.

You'll be working in Central starting next week.
Yes, sir.
It'll become quiet around here.
You were quite the flashy one.
Not anywhere near as flashy as you were in your prime, sir.
I was able to relax because you worked so hard.
But I also learned a lot from all of those jobs you gave me.
Check.
I was finally able to beat you.
Let's call this victory a parting gift.
General.
I'd also like to ask for another gift.
Sgt. Major Kain Fuery.
Warrant Officer Vato Falman.
2nd Lt. Heymans Breda.
2nd Lt. Jean Havoc.
Lieutenant Riza Hawkeye.
The five of you will be transferring to Central with me.
I won't take any complaints.
Come with me!
Colonel, I can't.
I just recently found a girlfriend.
Break up with her.

Again?!
Your wounds haven't even healed yet.
Master...
I'm so happy to see you're well.
I heard rumors about you going around killing State Alchemists.
I understand your resentment.
The ones who annihilated our village were State Alchemists.
But all revenge does is give birth to more revenge.
A futile chain like that must be stopped immediately.
You must persevere.
Sorry to interrupt.
Whoa, he really was here!
An Ishbalan with a cross scar on his forehead.
We're splitting the prize money like we agreed, Mr. Yoki.
Huh? Where's Mr. Yoki?
Hey!
What's this all about?
You had nowhere to go, so we treated you like family-
Shut up!
Don't go comparing me with you Ishbalans!
I'm going to rise again!
I'm going to keep rising and rising,and eventually get rid of that damned Edward Elric!
Now you two, please do your thing.
Seems I'll only bring trouble while I'm here.
You're an obedient one.
Y-You bastard! What did you do?!
I'll give you some time to pray to God.
G-God? You seriously think I believe-
Wait!
Stay away!
I-I was wrong!
Please spare my life!
I'll follow you forever!
Are you going?
You'll sadden your brother.
There's no going back for me.
Here he comes.
We were waiting for you, guest.
"We know your secret."
"Come to Devil's Nest."
Are you the ones who know this "secret"?
We sure are. We know quite a lot.
I also want to know my own secret.
Then it's settled.
Follow me.
But my master taught me not to follow strangers.
How old are you?
Fourteen.
If you're fourteen, shouldn't you be able to make your own decisions?
You can't be saying things like "master taught me" forever.
I see! I have to make my own decisions then, huh?
That's right!
So come with-
So I decided to tie you guys up and beat the secrets out of you.
So in the end, you chose force.
I'm coming in!
Y-You're inside-
Hey, stay put!
How does it feel to have your body controlled from the inside?
Even if you do this, you can't stop my movements completely!
You're right. But...
As long as I can restrict your movements just a bit...
We can win the fight.
Did I hurt you?
I hit my head.
Giving us trouble...
Who are you guys...
They're chimeras.
My henchmen.
Wow, that's so cool! You really are empty.
I'm Greed.
Let's try to get along.
What are you guys, really?
You were lying about being chimeras, right?
There's no way chimeras can talk!
There's no way "there's no way".
Since this girl who's inside you right now is a chimera that was transmuted with a snake.
And Roa, who's behind me... What are you again?
A cow?
Yes.
Other than that, we've got a lizard and a crocodile.
The guy you fought earlier takes a piss with one leg up.
I do not!
You're a dog?
Yeah. It's pretty useful.
No way...
That can't be true!
And besides, who are you going to say performed the transmutation successfully?
The army.
No way...
Anyway, it just means there's a flip side to this world that society doesn't know about.
On a different note, I'm not a chimera.
I'm a homunculus.
Homunculus?!
You've heard of them, haven't you?
Humans that were created artificially.
That's what I am.
Homunculus?
It's another name for an android.
But it's said in the book that you're not allowed to create humans.
You're lying!
I've never even heard of anyone creating a homunculus!
Geez...
Let me show you some proof.
W-What did you do that for?!
That's one death for me.
No way...
Do you understand now?
There's no way "there's no way".
Besides, aren't you living proof of that?
An existence with a soul and no body.
How did you...
I know just about everything that goes on in this other world.
Let's get to the point.
How does it feel to be immortal with just a soul?
Transmuting a soul and affixing it to another object.
If you do it correctly, that person can gain eternal life.
Am I wrong?
I'm Greed.
I'm greedy,
so I want money, women, status, fame, and everything else in this world!
And I want eternal life!
But aren't you already immortal?
I was made pretty durable,
so I've been alive for almost two hundred years.
But I'm not quite immortal.
Now, I've told you my secret.
It's your turn.
Tell me the secret to that body.
You should spill it.
You don't want to be taken apart and dissected, do you?
It's impossible.
I don't have any memories of when I became like this,
and I'm not the one who performed the transmutation.
I don't know anything.
Then what about the guy who did it?
We can ask him.
That's...
Where the heck did Al disappear to?
I don't mind telling ya.
If you tell us his secret, that is.
Brother!
I would never have expected you to get kidnapped.
Brother, this guy's a homunculus!
Homunculus?
Hey, don't go blowing my secret!
So he might have a hint on how to get our bodies back!
Tattoo of Ouroboros.
That's how it is.
It would have been easier if we could have just settled things with the armor boy.
If you're buddies with them,why don't you just ask them yourself?
"Them"?
There were people with that tattoo at Research Laboratory 5.
And there, I met a guy who hadhis soul affixed to a piece of armor.
Seriously?
Well, for certain reasons,
I can't really do that.
So let's discuss this.
You two want to get your bodies back, right?
I'll teach you how to create a homunculus.
And in exchange, you teach me how to transmute a soul.
It's called equivalent exchange.
But seriously...
Is there even a need to get your body back?
Personally, I think that body can be somewhat useful.
No, it's not!
You think so?
You don't get hungry,you don't get sleepy, you don't get tired.
Sounds awesome to me!
Cut... The...
...Shit!!!
Useful?! Awesome?!
You don't know anything,and yet you're spewing all this bullshit?!
How to transmute a soul?!
You're not getting an ounce of it from me!!!
If you're a villain, I'll beat you up, smack you,punch the information out of you and snatch it!!
In other words, I get all and you get nothing!
There's no need for equivalent exchange when dealing with a villain!!!
Guess we have to use force again.
Don't kill him.
Fine, fine.
I met a guy on death row who was a lot faster than you!
Next.
Roa, take the armor boy with you.
We'll take him apart and dissect him.
Roger.
H-Hey!
Wait!
Useless.
With a steel sword like that, you can't even add a scratch to this ultimate shield!
Your head's wide open!
Oww... that hurt.
If I was an ordinary human,I'd need to go to the hospital for this.
Yeah, but you're not really ordinary at all.
Well, my body is normal,
but I've got a little bit of regeneration, and I have the ultimate shield.
Get it now?
You can't beat me.
It'd be smarter to just make the trade.
Oh, you're one of those people, aren't you?
You don't care if you get covered in wounds,
but if your relatives get hurt,you can't take it and lose your cool.
How foolish.
You're going to let your strong feelings take over like that and lose important information and your brother?
I'll go get my brother back after I beat your ass.
Your regeneration ability isn't endless, right?
As long as I keep hitting the part of you that's flesh, then...
My bad, sorry for going easy on you.
This turns me into an ugly guy,so I don't really like to show people.
Didn't I say so?
You won't even be able to scratch me.
I found this in the back alley of West Street.
Al disappeared... and now Ed, too.
Those idiots! I may even have to make them students again and teach them about taking care of personal belongings!
I've got it!
I heard someone who looks like Ed went into a bar called Devil's Nest.
You dead?
Good! Kids should be lively.
No matter how many times you try, you can't win.
How about you tell me the secret now?
Thanks for that.
The blood that was all up in my head went away, and I can think clearly now.
That's my mechanic for ya.
It still moves after all this.
You're still going to resist?
Let this put you to sleep!
I'm solid, aren't I?
That's weird...
So what?!
What, don't you have anything else?!
What the hell... did you do to my shield....
It's simple if you think about it.
You said you're a homunculus, but if your body is normal, that means a third of your body is made up of carbon.
Depending on how the carbon atoms are combined, the toughness can range from a pencil tip's to a diamond's.
If you know that much, then it's all a matter of alchemy.
Good!
Otherwise, it wouldn't be fun!
And now, I just figured something out!
You can't harden and regenerate at the same time!
My first impression of you was that of a reckless idiot.
But how many more times can you attack me with that body?
Hi, coming in.
M-Master!
You dumbass!!!
You don't even care enough to put away a single broomstick?!
I-I'm sorry!
Looks like you gave my boys quite a bit of trouble.
Master! He's...
I know.
I could hear you all the way from the hallway.
Come on, give me a break.
I don't really like fighting women-
What... the hell are you?!
A passing...
...housewife!!!
Those who are strong are destined to yield to ones who are far stronger.
But their souls will not lose as long as they have pride.
Next time, Fullmetal Alchemist:
Episode 14, Those Who Lurk Underground.
There's more than meets the eye.~ENG~
blue scene
Where are you, Sir Kimblee?!
This is far from what you promised!
You said your soldiers in Briggs would betray the others if we were to carry the attack to the fort!
Cease fire!
That was a crushing victory.
Yeah.
So this...
...is the bloody crest.
So I'm saying...
...you're supposed to read the veins of the dragon while performing Eastern Alchemy!
And I'm saying...
...I don't understand how!
You're supposed to sharpen your senses!
Ready, go!
See? I sense it!
I can't do that!
Yes, you can!
Teach me the theories behind it!
Things are real rowdy in there.
I don't get it!
Sorry for having to ask you to hide us here.
Hey, don't worry about it.
We're benefiting as well.
Not the hair!
Now the kids have someone new to play with.
Let Zampano know that we're going up to the mountains to collect firewood.
Sure.
Damn it!
What a nightmare!
Where the hell is Zampano?! Everyone else is working!
Yo!
This way.
Follow me.
I'm counting on you, Zampano.
Episode 43, An Ant's Bite.
So, you found out about Selim.
Yes.
And my identity, as well.
Yes.
How do you feel as a citizen of a country...
...to know that your leader and his son are both homunculi?
I believe it's a very sad thing for a family member you're supposed to trust to be fabricated.
It's almost like you're playing house.
All the while pretending to be human, creatures you deem as fools.
As you say, he's my "son" given to me by my handlers.
My rank of FÃ¼hrer President, along with my men and everything else, was also given to me.
Rather than "house", I'd say it's more accurate to say we're playing "politics".
However, I picked my bride myself.
Is the tea still not ready?
P-Pardon me.
Delicious.
Wow, so you used to be one of the head honchos of that Research Laboratory 5.
I wouldn't say that. I just had a couple of people working under me.
I wonder how they're doing now...
Hey!
Who might that be?
He's a vagrant I met this morning.
He wanted to have you see him, Doctor-
That's enough, Zampano.
The shitty acting ends here.
Why hello, Doctor.
What might you be doing here?
You're being too optimistic if you think roaches like you can outwit us.
What the hell is this?!
Zampano!
The shitty acting ends here, right?!
Our goal from the start was to lure you here!
Knowing how much of a nasty guy you are,
I figured you'd come and hunt me yourself if you knew I was alive!
What can three pieces of trash like you do?!
No matter how many you've got on your side,you're nothing but trash in the end-
They work like landmines.
Alchemy evolves every day!
There's no way alchemy like that can exist-
Dammit!
If they're mines...
...all I have to do is trace your footsteps!
How can this be?!
They were made to only react to homunculi!
You can't tell where they are and what awaits you because of all the snow.
So, tell me.
How does it feel to be ridiculed by peopleyou've been looking down on as trash and scum?
He's being fooled, all right.
It's just remote alchemy.
You bastards!
You scum should obey our commands, just as you were meant to!
You're nothing but trash! Don't get too cocky!
Doctor!
That was close.
Th-Thanks.
Grr. You're pretty fast for a fatass.
Don't underestimate trash!
You little shit!!
Such weak attacks can hardly pierce my skin!
Is that so?
Then what about 
Did he do it?!
Got you now!
Doctor!
Whoa, don't move.
If you do, I'll snap him in half.
Now...
...you're in for some punishment.
Didn't I warn you, Doctor?
By saying I'll destroy an entire village if you were to do something unnecessary?
I won't let you!
You're still going to resist?
Man, you're dumb.
Okay, I'll destroy those slums over there.
Stop!
But simply destroying them is no fun.
Perhaps I'll bring a few back to Central and make a philosopher's stone out of them.
You filth!
You're still making those things over at Central?!
Release the researchers...
Release my men!
Huh?
That's impossible.
Because you see, we've already turned all of them into philosopher's stones.
E-Even my men?!
Oh? Guess I forgot to tell you, huh?
But Doctor, you shouldn't have any reason to weep 
Since you've made so many philosopher's stones in the past.
Using human lives.
You're right.
I've made many philosopher's stones, sacrificing the lives of many people.
I am more familiar with the ways of making aphilosopher's stone than anyone else in this country.
Knowing how to make one...
...also means I know how to destroy them!!
What on earth is that?!
It's coming from the hill where the doctor and the others are!
Oww! Oww!
Oww! Oww! Ow! Ow!
No...
It hurts!
This is...
No...
This-
This can't be...
I'm Envy...
There's no way I could be defeated by you inferior beings...
No...
Even the chimeras...
Don't look at me...
D-Don't look at-
Don't look down on me, humans!!!
Don't look at me, you insects...
Little shits...
Don't... look...
We were being manipulated by something like 
We won, Marcoh.
They're back!
Doctor Marcoh! What's with that wound?!
What's 
Wow, so you guys were doing some amazing things without us knowing.
This is what happens when you disobey us humans!
Why did you do something so reckless, Doctor Marcoh?
All my life, I've been doing everything as ordered.
But this was the one thing I wanted to settle myself.
Thinking on my own... Making a decision on my own...
Just like your parents did things.
But please, try not to be so reckless.
Okay.
Oww!!
Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!
Sir Yoki?
H-Help me...
I've taken over this guy's body!
Stop!
You monster!
M-My body isn't listening to me!
No use putting up a fight!
Now, you trash!
If you want to help this guy...
Nah, you can do whatever you want with him.
He's not really our friend, anyway.
It's been a short while, Sir Yoki...
I'll never forget you!
Master Scar!

Right?!
Don't look away, dammit!!
I believed in you, Master!
W-What? I thought this guy was your friend!
I believed in you!
Quit putting up a useless fight, Envy!
At this point, we don't exactly care about our actions.
If you're going to get in our way,we'll destroy you along with that man!
Dammit...
He came off.
Really?
Nice act.
I-I'm not very good at bluffs...
Damn you all!
None of you are my friends!
Our friendship is over!
I have nothing to do with you anymore!
Damn...
So, it's about time you tell us what you guys are up to.
Like I'll tell you.
What did you say?!
Spill it!
Spill the beans, you insect!
Keep it up!
Show him who's boss, Zampano!
If I tell you, I'll just be killed later!
Why would I tell you, idiots?
You son of a...
Oh yeah, where's the Fullmetal runt?
Brother?
He should be in Briggs right now.
Oh?
Last I heard, he was missing.
What?!
What do you mean?!
Tell me more!
I heard a mine collapsed in Baschool.
I wonder if he's alive...
No way...
That can't be true.
So, what should we do?
Should we head back to Baschool?
No.
In a situation like this...
...Brother would definitely believe in the safety of the other team and keep moving forward.
So I want to do the same.
Hope is not lost.
I'm going to split off for a bit.
I've been thinking about it for a little while now.
Instead of simply detesting this country for denying Ishbal...
...I'm going to work to change it.
And for that, I need your help as well, Marcoh.
Sure.
I'll go with you.
To change this country...
The thing is, there's a city I want to visit, as well.
Where?
Liore.
If my predictions are correct, that tunnel should be there, too.
May, take this thing and return to your country.


Hey, Master!
It's the wreck of an immortal homunculus.

With this, your clan may be saved.




Did you come to this country with a resolve that weak?
If your clan happens to lose its struggle for power,
what are you going to tell the people who placed their fate in your hands?
"I failed because I was too busy helping people from another country"?!
Go.
We, the citizens of this country, will take care of it ourselves.
Thank you... so much!
Take care, May.
Once we settle things here, I'll visit you to learn more about Eastern Alchemy.
Sir Al...
Sir Al!
I... I...
Thank you so much, everyone!
Good bye!
Take care!
She's gone...
Yeah.
Well then, we should get going, as well.
Right.
Mr. Greed...
No luck.
Apparently, Izumi Curtis is out on vacation with her husband, and no one knows when they'll be back.
Guess there's not much we can do.
We should head back and report this to FÃ¼hrer President Bradley for now.
Bradley?!
You're coming with me, Greed.
Call someone to take over.
Good idea.
I might be able to see Mr. Greed if I follow them...
But...
Umm...
Would you mind moving your foot, Sister?
You are to address me as "Major General" here!
Aye, ma'am!
You've got a cowardly face on as always, I see.
I heard the battle with Drachma ended with your crushing victory.
Of course!
But wouldn't that just speed up the completion of the Nationwide Transmutation Circle?
It doesn't matter.
What we must protect right now is the safety of the country itself.
If there stands an enemy who threatens that very peace...
...our job is to deliver an overwhelming defeat of perfection!
Oh dear... why must you act so fierce?
At this rate, you'll never find someone to marry-
You just lack the fighting spirit!
You laggard!
Being with you makes me feel cowardly as well!
There you are, Major General.
He's your brother, I take it?
I don't even want to think of him as my brother.
He's a coward who ran away from Ishbal.
Follow me.
There's something I'd like to show you.
Are you aware of the three laws State Alchemists are forbidden to disobey?
If I recall...
"Do not oppose the military."
"Do not make gold."
And "Do not create humans."
Precisely.
The first law is self-explanatory.
The second law is put in place to avoid economic turmoil.
Then what about the third?
Why does the nation forbid alchemists from creating humans?
I assume it's because of the moral and ethical implications.
Even among alchemists, I hear the act is tacitly forbidden as a blasphemy to God.
You're wrong there.
What is and is not ethical changes with time and also depends on whom you ask.
That is not the reason.
It is to prevent an individual from creating a powerful army of their own, Major General.






























This place is in ruins...
Is there really a place to eat around here?
Let's see... I know it was around here somewhere...
Rose!
How have you been?!
I should be asking you the same thing, Al!
What, you're still on a journey?
Oh, you know her?
Yeah, something like that.
Al, where's Ed?
He's not with you?
B-Brother isn't with us today.
Oh... that's too bad.
I really wanted to see him.
What's this?
Wh-What?!
No, I was just pondering the meaning behind that mysterious look on your face.
Quit saying weird things!
Hey, Rose!
I finished washing the pots!
Is there anything else for me to-
Reunion. Revival. Resolve.
The time has come to set the soul afire.
As long as they live, humans continue to move forward.
No matter how thorny the path may be.
Next time, Fullmetal Alchemist:
Episode 44, Full Throttle.
Awaken, human.
Now is the beginning.


Hey, where the hell are you taking us?
Get in.
This is...
Military Headquarters?!
What does this mean?!
Hey.
You guys are filthy.
I wouldn't have dreamed the homunculi's hideout was under Headquarters...
So it means that the army is also associated with them, not just the FÃ¼hrer President.
But I've got something good to tell you, too.
Really?! You really found my body?!
Yeah.
Although you told me,"You're not my soul, so I can't come with you."
Great, so my body still exists!
Awesome! Awesome!
Okay!
This just means we're one step closer to our goal.
Hey, why do you still have that cat?
Oh, her?
Actually, inside of me, there's...
What?!
That midget?!
Brother! Stop being so loud!
Hurry and put your underwear on!
What are you guys doing?! Hurry up!
No!!!
Episode 29, The Fool's Struggle.
Geez, why the hell did you have to bring her?
There was no other choice. She's injured.
Hey!
I'm leaving the rest to Wrath. Go in.
Wrath?
Wrath...
FÃ¼hrer President King Bradley?!
Colonel!
What the hell happened?
Quite a bit.
Sergeant Fuery was transferred to the South, Warrant Officer Falman to the North,
and Second Lieutenant Breda to the West.
And Lieutenant Hawkeye is going to be an assistant to the FÃ¼hrer President.
What the hell...
That's no more than taking hostages.
Have a seat.
Right now, it's just us and the FÃ¼hrer President in this room.
And he only has one weapon; a sword.
Yet, he's still confident he can beat all three of us?

FÃ¼hrer President!
You came to visit me in the hospital once, right?
I was completely fooled.
"Don't meddle in things.Think of the entire army as your enemy."
That's what I told you.
You are all important to us.
You don't need to know about the minor details,
but behave until the time comes.
As long as you keep that promise, we won't harm you.
And when that time comes, what'll happen to the civilians who aren't "human sacrifices" like us?
I just told you. You don't need to know the minor details,
Fullmetal Alchemist.
"Fullmetal Alchemist", eh?
I chose to become a dog of the military in order to get my body back.
But the State Alchemist Institution itself was probably created to pick out these sacrifices.
If I'm going to be used by you guys again on top of that...
I quit my job as a State Alchemist!
Your proof of being a dog is covered in blood.
Whatever you guys are planning, I'll put an end to it.
I'll tell the other alchemists, and...
What was her name again?
Oh, that's right. Winry Rockbell.
Born in Resembool.
A childhood friend of yoursand someone who is practically family.
A skilled automail mechanic.
She currently works at Rush Valley,and she's loved by her customers and friends.
She's a good, obedient girl.
Lay a finger on her and see what happens! People around her, too!
So, what are you going to do?
If you still want to quit, then I'll cut her down.
Excellent.
Excuse me...
We get the idea.
So, umm...
Like before, please let us continue to search for cluesfor getting our bodies back while being under surveillance.
Please.
Very well.
As long as you don't interfere with our plan.
What will you do, Colonel Mustang?
You're not going to tell me that you plan to resign from the military too, are you?
Let's see... even if I became a dog of the military, I'd rather not become a loser.
Either way, because of my ambition, I won't be able to take off this uniform or get rid of this. For now, at least.
Very well.
You all may leave.
May I ask you one thing, sir?
What is it, Colonel?
Are you the one who killed Hughes?
No, it was not me.
Then who?
You said "one thing", did you not?
Please excuse me.
Oh. Wait a moment, Alphonse.
U-Umm... Is there something...
No, you may leave now.
That was so close!
A sword just went right over my head...
Oh yeah, Colonel.
Money. Lend me some change.
What's this all of a sudden?
Don't worry about it!
Man, this is all you got?
What are you, a thief?!
Oh well.
Later!
H-Hey!
Sorry, Colonel!
We'll report everything later!
What in the world are they up to?
Oh no, the Lieutenant!
Lieute-
Is something the matter, Colonel?
You don't look very well.
Can you blame me for feeling sick after seeing a musclehead when I was expecting to see a woman?
Colonel!
Lieutenant.
Is everything okay?
Oh, my apologies.
Lieutenant Hawkeye, just returning from the restroom, sir.
I accepted Major Armstrong's kindness and had him take my place for a short time.
Thank you, Major.
No problem at all.
You didn't run away?
Who's the one who told meto never give up no matter what?
Don't regret later that you didn't run away, Lieutenant.
Like I will after all this time...
Hello?
Ed? What's with the sudden call?
Did you break your automail again?
No!
Hey, are you okay?
Are you doing well?
Anything new in your life?
You're not being stalked by anyone, are you?
Ed...
What is it?!
You're being creepy.
What did you say?!
I mean, it's rare enough for you to call, and it turns out you're worried about me?
Geez, there's something wrong here.I bet it's going to snow tonight or something.
Hey! Do you have any idea how much I-
Hey, thanks.
I'm happy you called.
Thanks.
S-Sure.
So you're really okay, right?
Got it. Bye.
Good, she was fine...
It's your excitable nature that lets people take advantage of you.
Ling!
I told you, I'm Greed.
What the hell do you want?!
Your buddy asked me to give you this.
Ling did?
This is in Xing's language, huh...
What's it say?
I don't know. Can't read it.
He wants you to give it to the woman waiting for him.
Lan Fa-
You're not planning on following us and killing her, are you?
I'm not that low.
Besides, I don't like fighting girls.
I don't lie.
Later. Be sure to give it to her.
Hey, Ling!
I'm Greed.
Who the hell was that?
What reason did he have to start the civil warwhen it would ruin this country?
Who is it?
Is someone up there?
You're injured.
Could you come down?
I'd like to know what's going on outside.
It's fine; the guard won't be coming again for a while.
I'm also a doctor. I'll tend your wounds.
An Ishbalan, huh?
That scar on your forehead...
Don't tell me... You're Scar?!
Who the hell are you?
What are you doing here?
Oh, God!
I'm...
I'm also an alchemist who assisted in the Ishbal Extermination!
She'll be fine. Nothing life-threatening.
She'll get better as long as she gets some rest.
Thank goodness.
"Thank goodness" my ass!
Giving me more patients by the day!
Both my bed and sofa are occupied!
Where the hell am I supposed to sleep, huh?!
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!
Besides, two patients in my house at once?!
Alphonse.
Lan Fan!
You shouldn't be up!
Is... Is the young master not with you?
I-It's fine. He's alive.
I have a message from him.
Lan Fan?
He says... He says he's obtained a philosopher's stone...
With this, our clan is...
That's right! I must return to my country immediately and tell my people!
Where is he? Where is the young master?
What? Why won't you speak?
Don't tell me something happened to him!
Answer me, Alphonse!
Where is the young master?!
How is your body feeling, Greed?
So you're Wrath.
I'm feeling fine.
Did you hear? This body belongs to a prince of Xing.
He wanted power that would help him become Emperor, and thus accepted me.
He's a really interesting guy.
Him and I once had a discussion on what it means to be a true king.
He said something like, "A king exists for his people. Without his people, there is no king."
What an idiot. He gave in to greed and lost everything.
Shut up!
Don't underestimate us humans!
That's how it is.
He's vigilantly watching for a chance to take over.
He's even planning on taking control of a monster?
How greedy can these humans get?
The FÃ¼hrer President is a homunculus?!
It's always been my honor to fight for the weak citizens of this country.
Many people feel the same,believe in the military, and sign up.
And yet, the military itself...
Why not resign?
With your personality, being a soldier will only hurt you.
Sir! This is wrong!
Are you going against military command?!
Whatever! Call for a replacement State Alchemist!
I ran from battle in Ishbal...
...because I thought what the army was doing was wrong.
But instead, I should have fought against it instead of running away.
Since then, not a day has passed that I didn't feel ashamed for bending my principles and fleeing.
And this time, if the army itself is the battlefield, how can I run away again?
What are you going to do now, Colonel?
I told the FÃ¼hrer President I wouldn't quit because I still have an ambition.
The fact the FÃ¼hrer President revealed he's a homunculus means that even if he was to be defeated,
there's still someone else in the shadows.
I'm being tested.
Don't you think that's an honor?
You're being pretty calm about this.
I don't know if I'd say that.
It was the same when I fought that other homunculus, Lust, but...
Although people accuse me of being a "weapon" and a "monster", when fighting against real monsters...
...I truly feel as though I'm nothing but an ordinary human.
I see.
So the young master took in the stone.
Sorry.
If only we had been able to stop him...
You don't need to apologize.
I am only mad at myself for not being able to fulfill my duty as a bodyguard.
So...
So the young master is still inside this Greed person, right?
Alphonse, I want a replacement arm. And quick.
But... it'll take some time...
Please introduce me to an automail mechanic! Please!
Okay.
I will soon.
But you have to get better before I do that.
Let's get you something to eat from Dr. Nox...
You can get up now?
Let's see... was your name May Chan?
May?!
What?!
As expected of the Yao Clan's watchdog.
And you're... the Chan Clan's successor.
Indeed.
I'm the 17th Princess of Xing, May Chan.
Wait... um...
If you're here in this country, it means... you're after immortality, as well.
I'll never let you and your clan have it!
You won't even be able to find it!
Hang on!
I don't really get it, but let's play nice!
Don't interfere with our country's affairs!
Don't interfere with our country's affairs!
Don't underestimate me just because I'm injured.
Same to you!
What the hell are you two doing?!
Patients should be asleep in bed!
Don't interfere with our country's...
Hell if I care about your country's affairs, moron!
Geez!
Patients are patients, no matter what country they're in!
You're planning on messing up my house even more?
Hey...
You've heard about cases where unknown pathogens mysteriously appear in a doctor's house and kill everyone...
...right?!
This place really is a mess.
Doesn't he have anyone to clean for him?
Doctor, look.
Oh, so that's where it was.
Wait! Isn't this a picture of your family?!
It's my divorced wife and my son.
What?
I'm free to do whatever I want with my stuff!
Have a cup of coffee after this is all cleaned up.
I'm so glad you came!
Seriously, look at this.
I was at a loss about what to do.
Huh? Now that I think about it, I can use alchemy again.
Very nice work! This is all for the repairs.
But seriously, State Alchemists are something else.
On a totally different level from other alchemists.
The thing is, we asked nearby alchemists to help us this morning.
They were completely useless.
They came to the scene all full of themselves, and as soon as they were getting started, they told us it wasn't working.
In the morning...
That's around the time we were underground.
Mr. Alchemist!
Thanks!
Thanks.
Can I really believe what Envy said?
That those people are only made of energy, without a body or a soul...
Pull yourself together! Think about the future, not the past!
But at that time, other alchemists aside from Al and I were unable to use alchemy.
But that midget and Scar could.
What does this mean?
Alchemy that's different from ours...
If I could find out the secret behind it,
there may be a way to get Al's body back and fight against that geezer without using a philosopher's stone...
I have to return this to the Lieutenant.
They made me help them.
I created philosopher's stones and took the lives of many Ishbalans.
And now, I'm on the verge of being forced to work on an experiment that would cause more deaths.
So...
So please, I'm begging you! Kill me!
Right here, right now!
I'm going to get back at them with death!
Right now, in my eyes, you appear as God...
You haven't told me everything about Ishbal yet!
What the hell did you bastards do there?!
Tell me everything, Marcoh!
Before my right hand destroys you!!!
Force. Never-ending violence.
The earth is drowned in blood.
The air is choked with the stench of burnt flesh.
Ishbal...
A detestable memory.
Next time, Fullmetal Alchemist:
Episode 30, Ishbal Extermination.
I will recite the truth.
Although I'm the only one left.















































So that's Roy Mustang.
The Flame Alchemist, eh?
An exceptional promotion at that age?I wonder what kind of connections he used.
They say the faster you rise, the faster you fall.
Come in.
Sorry to bother you.
I am Colonel Roy Mustang.
Ah, Colonel Mustang.
I apologize. The FÃ¼hrer President is out right now.
To where?
He went to the South for an inspection.
South?
I don't like this smell.
But it smells familiar.
This is...
I simply came for an inspection,but it seems I just discovered something.

Move in!
A brat and a housewife?! How grand.
But I'm kind of ill-matched for a fight.
I'll be making my escape.
You-
M-Master, hang in there!
Running away?! How cowardly...
Master...
Master! Master!!!
Stay...
...still...
N...o...
Greed!
Looks like you're okay, Martel.
What happened? I haven't seen Roa and the others, either...
Yeah, things have become a little complicated.
We have to get out of here somehow.
I can't let you do that.
Huh? Who are you, old man?
FÃ¼hrer President!
Why are you here?
King Bradley?!
So what business does the most powerful guy in the country have with us?
How old are you?
Huh?
I'm turning sixty this year.
When you get old, your body starts to not move the way you want it to.
So I really want to get this over with and go home.
Retire already, gramps.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, you're not just an ordinary geezer, are you?!
Greed?!
Now you've seen it.
A skill that has been passed down in the Armstrong household for generations... Sculpture Alchemy!!!
In that case, I won't hold back.
How strange...
We've ensured the safety of the boy and the housewife.
We'll proceed with the extermination of all the monsters!
It's an order from the FÃ¼hrer President!
It's been a while since anyone's gotten me so excited.
Nothing less to be expected from Sir Armstrong.
I also participated in the Ishbal extermination.
Former ally, eh?
Then all the more reason not to kill you.
Surrender at once.
Even though you're planning on killing me?
Major!
Roa!
Bastard!!!
You see,
I don't have an ultimate shield like you,
nor an ultimate spear that pierces diamond.
Do you understand how someone like that could have survived countless battles,
rendered distinguished service,and has achieved the rank I have right now?
Y...ou...
Just as you have an ultimate shield,
I have an ultimate eye.
Now, Greed.
How many times do I have to kill you to get rid of you for good?
Where's Greed?
I don't know.
It's too dark; I can't see anything.
Greed?!
No!
Hey! Open up!
No!
Let me out!
I said no!
That was fifteen deaths, wasn't it?
How many more do you have? Hmm?
Y-You bastard...
Dammit...
The FÃ¼hrer President himself is here?
I don't mind if you run off with your tail between your legs.
I'd love to,
but dogs are loyal animals.
Please, get her out of here.
We're counting on you.
Roa?! Dolcetto?!
Hey, quit interfering! Let me out!
I won't!
I don't have time to mess with you!
I'm telling you to open up!
No! You can't come out!
Shut up and open up!
Are you telling me to just sit and watch my friends be killed?!
I can't let you out!
They asked me to keep you safe!
Dolcetto!!!
Roa!!!
Please, I'm begging you...
You can't... come out.
Hey, hey, Mister Bradley.
You really think you'll get away with doing this to my men?
You're feeling sympathetic now? How silly.
Sympathy?
Are you stupid?
Who do you think I am?
I'm Greed.
Money, women, subordinates...
...everything belongs to me!
Which is why I won't abandon what's mine.
I'm a greedy guy, after all!!!
Greedy? This is beyond silly.
How about you lie there for a while.
I have to get out of here...
Hang on.
You're Edward's brother, aren't you?
Are you hurt? Let me lend you a hand.
N-No, I'm fine.
I can go back by myself.
No, Martel!
No, Martel!
Bradley!!!
Al!!!
M-Mom!
Mom! Mom!!!
Al! Hang in there!
Hey, say something!
Al!
Brother...
You all right?
You're covered in blood, too, Brother...
I opened you up and pulled her body out.
I couldn't save her...
It's not your fault.
Come on. Let's go back.
Al...
Hold there.
I've got something I need to ask you both.
The mastermind of this incident, Greed. Is he an acquaintance of yours?
No, sir.
Did you happen to obtainany important information from him?
Nothing that would benefit the army, no.
Don't misunderstand me. Not for the army.
If you were making a deal with them...
...depending on your answer...
Did you ally yourself with people whose intent was to harm the mainstay of the army?
No, sir.
Any other questions?
Your steel arm and your brother's body.
They're related, are they not?
You're an honest one.
Time to withdraw.
Take good care of your little brother, you hear?
I deeply appreciate you saving those two boys.
Don't worry about it.
It's one of the duties of the army to protect State Alchemists, too.
How about it?
Would you like to be protected by the army, too?
Become a State Alchemist?
Precisely.
As you can see, I'm a frail housewife.
Is this country so strained as to require the help of someone like me?
Harsh words!
I'll come again.
You may have changed your mind by then.
That Greed guy had a tattoo of Ouroboros on his hand.
Ouroboros...
You heard me telling Lt. Colonel Hughes, didn't you?
They're people who have something to do with the philosopher's stones.
Sir Hughes...
Edward Elric.
Don't do anything too reckless, all right?
Okay...
Well then...
Brother.
My memories of when my body was taken have returned.
How was it?!
Well...
It was kind of extraordinary...
But I couldn't find anything about human transmutation.
I see...
In the end, no progress, eh...
Not necessarily.
Remember what the FÃ¼hrer President said?
That there have been disquieting activities within the military.

He said he wanted to catch them for that reason, right?
Greed also had that tattoo.
If so, why did he need to kill them all?
If he really wanted to know what they were up to,he should have captured and interrogated them, right?
You're right.
And besides, it's strange the FÃ¼hrer President himself came to the battlefield when there weren't that many enemies.
Yeah. Everything just seems so fishy.
Guess we'll stick with the army for a little longer.
Welcome back, FÃ¼hrer President.
How did the inspection of the South go?
The Fullmetal Alchemist's brother...
...and perhaps their master, too.
Both of them may also be suitable sacrifices.
I also found something else that was unexpected.
Oh my, now that's someone I haven't seen in a while.
He left this place a century ago.
Wake up, Greed.
Oh wow, looks like everyone's here.
So much for your ultimate shield.
You look as gorgeous as you did a century ago.
Miss Lust, the "Ultimate Spear".
And Gluttony, you haven't lost weight at all.
And, Envy? You still dress like that?
Where's Sloth at?
He always skips out on meetings.
He's working right now.
Seriously, none of you guys have changed over a hundred years.
And who's this guy?
I am Wrath.
Wrath?
Aren't you King Bradley?
Yup. He's our last sibling Father created as a human by the name of King Bradley.
An aging homunculus?!
Is that even possible?
"There's no way there's no way."
I thought that was a stock phrase of yours. Don't tell me you forgot?
Or are you going senile?
Shut your mouth, you ugly shit.
What was that?
Hey, I like those eyes. That's the way you ought to be.
How about you show your true colors every once in a while, Envy the Bizarre.
You piece of shit...
I'll kick your ass, if that's what you're asking for.
Cut it out, all of you.
Please don't fight among siblings, especially in front of your father.
Yo, old man.
Looks like you've aged a lot since the last time I saw you.
Greed.
You are my son who shares my soul.
Why did you betray me?
"Why"?
Shouldn't you know best?
I am Greed.
That's how you gave me life, and that's the way I've lived.
If I stayed by your side, I wouldn't be able to obtain everything my greedy soul desires.
Will you work for me again?
No can do!
I see...
I really don't like your tastes...
This is how hot I like my baths, damnit!
I'm sure the flames of Hell are hotter than this!
I'll go on ahead to see what it's like, my siblings!
Go back to where you came from, my soul, Greed!
You don't even have to ask!!!
Don't blame me if you get a stomachache, old man!!!
To the forthcoming day,
I pray for the unchanging loyalty of you all, along with peace and order.
Dad!
Welcome back, Dad!
Thank you, Selim.
How was the inspection?
It was a substantial inspection all right.
Dear, you're getting older...
Why not give up your position to a junior and relax?
No, no, I'm still in my prime.
Oh, that's right. I met theFullmetal Alchemist while in the South.
The short alchemist? Really?!
You really love hearing about Mr. Edward, don't you, Selim?
He's the youngest State Alchemist! That's just so cool!
That's awesome. I want to learn alchemy, too!
What in the world would you do with it?
I want to get a state qualification to be useful to Dad.
Then I might ask for your help in the future.
The pebbles foreigners throw into the water create ripples, and as they link together, they create a huge whirlpool.
Look! That's precisely what's happening right now.
Next time, Fullmetal Alchemist:
Episode 15, A Messenger from the East.
I hide my blade behind my smileand seek the philosopher's stone.
Vengeance...
Dammit!
It was Scar!
He knew that Marcoh was involved in the extermination?!
I'll let you know when I get more information.
Isn't being an assistant to the FÃ¼hrer President the same thing as being taken hostage?
You sure you'll be okay?
To look at it in a positive light, it means I have the chance to assassinate him in his sleep.
That's scary.
Oh, right.
Do me a favor and let the Colonel know that Scar is still lurking around.
Got it.
Lieutenant.
Yes?
Thanks for telling me about Ishbal.
Episode 31, The Promise Made For 520 Cenz.
Al!
Brother! What's up?
Wow... So that's how things were in Ishbal...
She was willing to tell me everything, despite me being a kid.
Alchemists are people who pursue the truth...
...and yet...
...we didn't even know about things so close to us.
So the Colonel is looking at the future that'll take place after he accomplishes his goal.
The future that'll take place after he accomplishes his goal, huh...
Al, what do you plan to do after you get your body back?
Let's see...
For starters, I want to taste Winry's apple pie.
What about you, Brother?
I haven't really thought about it, since I've always been so intent on getting my limbs back.
I guess I'll start off by going around to Granny and Master and letting them know first.
Yeah, they've really done a lot for us.
They'll all greet us with smiles, right?
Yeah.
We'll be able to see their smiles, right?
Yeah.
We're in a tight spot, but that sort of cheered me up.
I've got something good to tell you, too.
We couldn't use alchemy at that time.
And it turns out others couldn't, either.
Then what about that girl and Scar...
That's right. They were the only ones who could.
There's something different about their alchemy...
Something we're not aware of...
Yeah.
We're not at a dead end yet.
Left?!
That midget left?!
Yeah. Early this morning.
Did she say where she was headed?!
Nope.
We've got to look for her!
All of Central? Without a single lead?
We do have a lead.
What's this?
A gift.
In that case...
...couldn't you have brought me magazines with a lot of cute girls in 'em?
Don't be slacking off while we're gone, all right?
You're heading off already?
Yeah.
I'm off to taste some western specialty dishes.
You'd better take care of this place while we're gone!
I will.
Later.
Make sure you eat a lot and grow bigger and stronger.
Protect everyone while I'm away.
Sergeant Fuery.
Hey.
Warrant Officer Falman!
You still haven't left yet?
I came to return something to the Colonel.
It sure was a short stay in Central...
Were you transferred to Southern Headquarters, Sergeant?
Yes, sir. Opposite from you.
I bet it's cold over in Northern Headquarters...
Well then, so long, Sergeant Fuery.
Farewell. May we meet again.
Sorry to bother you, Colonel.
Lieutenant.
I came to pick up something I left here.
I see.
Apparently, Scar is still lurking about.
Then I have to be extra careful.
Since I no longer have a skilled bodyguard.
Please don't die.
Of course.
Sorry to put you through so much trouble.
Perhaps I chose the wrong person to follow.
"If I ever stray away from my path, shoot me right away."
That was the deal.
Your actions are still within the permissible range.
You're too kind, Lieutenant.
So long, Colonel.
So long.
Please don't slack off, okay?
Sure...
My pawn...
I guess my hobbies got the best of me...
My bishop...
Yes, sir! It is an honor!
My rook...
Thanks.
My knight...
I'm stupid, so I had a rough time at the military academy.
And...
If you wish, I'll follow you to the depths of Hell.
...even my queen was taken from me.
But, it's too early...
...for checkmate.
Like this! This is what the cat looks like.
I'm looking for a little girl carrying this thing around.
Sorry, please ignore that alien he's holding up.
No one knows anything about that black and white cat...
I wonder if she left Central already?
Fullmetal.
Colonel!
I see. Eastern Alchemy from Xing, huh?
Got it.
I'll ask around about it, too.
To be honest, I didn't really want to ask you for any favors...
Oh, yeah. Speaking of being in debt...
...give me my money back.
Watch where you're going!
So you remembered...
How much do I owe you again? 500 cenz?
520 Cenz!
Don't try to play it off!
What the hell! You're so stingy!
At this rate, you'll never make it big!
Sorry...
Actually, I'm going to hold on to this.
I'll return it when you become the FÃ¼hrer President.
Who told you?
Lieutenant Hawkeye.
She told me about Ishbal, too.
Fullmetal.
You can keep the change for now,
but I'll be getting it back for sure.
When that time comes, I'll borrow money from you again.
With the promise "I'll give this back to you when you turn this country into a democracy".
And when you get that back, I'll borrow from you again and make you agree to something else.
Which means I have a long life ahead of me, huh?
That's right.
Quit worrying the Lieutenant!
Thanks for the ride!
Later.
You sure took a while.
I thought I'd be waiting here until I went bald.
Yo.
Oh, my! Roy!
It's been so long!
You look well, Vanessa.
Long time no see, Roy.
Good evening, Madam Christmas.
How have you been?
Not very well at all.
I came here to liven up.
What can I start you out with?
I'm actually recovering right now, so alcohol is a no-no.
I'll be asking for the specialty, Madam.
You got it.
Lieutenant General Grumman, you have a call from Central from a lady by the name of Madam Christmas.
Oh?
Seriously... Please don't tell civilians about our secret line.
It just means that I'm not completely useless.
Someone has a task for this old geezer.
You lost your arm, failed to protect the young master,and are now reduced to such a state...
Hey! What the hell are you doing?!
You still call yourself a chosen member of the Yao Clan?!
Have some honor!
Cut it out, old man!
She's injured!
I said stop!
Did you really lose it...
Did you really lose your arm...
I'm sorry, Grandfather.
I'm sorry...
Fool...
Fool...
As we promised, we'll set you up with an automail mechanic right away.
No.
Thank you for your consideration.
We shouldn't ask you to help us any further.
We'll somehow find an automail mechanic on our own.
But we can't just leave you like this!
Now that the enemy knows what Lan Fan looks like, we can't take any actions that may involve your friend in this.
Okay.
Thanks for the consideration.
You saved my granddaughter's life.
I thank you.
I ain't a doctor that should be receiving gratitude-
Dr. Nox, thank you so much.
G-Get the hell out of here!
I'm not kind enough to let you weirdos stay forever!
Seriously!
It seems the Emperor's condition is worsening by the day.
We must get the young master back and return to our country with the stone as soon as possible.
Let's go.
Yes, sir.
Just wait, you fiends.
We shall be back soon.
I'll never forget my gratitude to you for saving me.
Dr. Nox, thank you so much.
And 
One sec.
Who is it?
Oh.
Hey, Dad.
It's been so long.
Are you doing okay?
Of course.
We had some business around here, so...
You've gotten taller.
Don't you think you've lost some weight?
You're one to talk.
Is your work keeping you busy?
Yeah, I've been performing on corpses as always-
Well, wait.
I treated two live patients this week.
Isn't that funny?
Me, saving people's lives?
Dad, I'm studying to become a doctor.
I know that you've been going through a rough time ever since you returned from Ishbal.
Yet, you didn't quit your job.
I love you, Dad! As the doctor you are and have always been.
Idiot...
Why don't you come in?
The coffee's not too tasty, but have a cup or two.
Wow, it's such a mess in here!
Come, let's get this place cleaned up while Dad makes us coffee.
God, if you really do exist, please overlook this.
Even someone like me can enjoy a cup of coffee with his family, right?
And with this, Ishbal has completely fallen under the control of the army.
Well done, Major Kimblee.
How do you like the philosopher's stone?
It's wonderful.
I was able to perform transmutations beyond my dreams while ignoring the concept of equivalent exchange.
Good.
Make a record of the details and submit it.
Now give us the stone back.
What have you done, Kimblee?!
Now, it's only you all who know where the stone is.
You bastard!
What the hell?!
What happened?!
What was that?!
Whoops.
Come out, Kimblee. You're being released.
What's this about?
You don't need to know.
Is it an order from the higher-ups?
Shut up.
Besides, why weren't you put ondeath row after killing five officers?
What trick did you use?
Nothing in particular.
Maybe it's because of my natural virtues?
Don't make me laugh, you bomberman!
What the hell are the higher-ups thinking, releasing a freak like you?
Mr. Jailer, thanks for taking care of me for all this time.
Don't come back again.
Just a token of my gratitude.
Don't tell me...
Wait!
Stop! Please, take it off!
Kimblee!!!
It's a boring old toy.
Please give it to your kid or something.
Well then, farewell.
Now...
It's been a while, Kimblee.
Congratulations on your release.
So it was you all who let me out.
Yup.
We've run into a labor shortage.
Which means, you have a job for me?
Do you happen to remember Doctor Marcoh?
The scientist who helped create the philosopher's stone, right?
I remember him very clearly.
He may...
...have escaped.
"May have"?
It's still not clear yet.
One of the chimeras we placed as a watchdog was gone.
Marcoh is an alchemist especially skilled in organic transmutation.
The corpse may have been a substitute.
And to make matters worse,
there's a possibility he's on the run with Scar, an Ishbalan.
So, how does that sound to you...
...as someone who was ordered to annihilate Ishbal, the Crimson Alchemist?
Let's see...
If it's an Ishbalan that I forgot to kill, then it's hard to let this one pass.
You're allowed to kill Scar on sight.
But bring Marcoh back alive.
You released me from jail for something like that?
Once we capture Marcoh, we're going to wipe a town off the map just to show him who he's messing with.
Isn't that a pleasant job?
You're really a nasty person, aren't you?
I can finally use this, after all this time.
That may not be enough if we'replanning to destroy an entire town.
Wow...
Did you make this out of Ishbalans, too?
It's made out of the guys who were researching the stone under Doctor Marcoh.
You truly are nasty.
Why did you help me escape?
I...
There are still things I need to ask you.
About the alchemist named Kimblee, and...
...there were parts I couldn't understand in the research documents my brother left me.
Research documents?
"There's something strange about this country's alchemy" are the words he left me before he died.
Something about that should be written in the documents.
You're a skilled alchemist.
You'll be able to comprehend it, won't you?
Something strange about this country's alchemy?
Master. The little girl came back.
Mister Scar! You were okay!
Huh? We have another friend with us?
He's not a friend.
His name is Marcoh.
He's a man who created a philosopher's stone and assisted in the Ishbalan Extermination.
A philosopher's stone! For immortality?!
Mister Marcoh, do you know how to make the stone?!
How?! Please, tell me!
Well, that's...
Stop.
You shouldn't wish for such a thing.
I only destroyed the exterior of his face.
Please stop his bleeding.
Okay!
It's better to destroy his face so others won't be able to tell who he really is.
Are you okay, Mister Marcoh?
Let's go.
Huh? To where?
To the place I hid the documents.
North.
The figure hidden all this time reveals himself with a smile.

Next time, Fullmetal Alchemist:
Episode 32, The FÃ¼hrer President's Son.
Would it be better to not know?
Or perhaps...I've got a bad feeling about this place.
Father! I brought a sacrifice!
"Father"? So suddenly...
Who is it?
Dad?
Episode 28, Father.
Envy.
Envy?!
This is him?!
Brother!
Brother!
Al?
Al in the armor... which means...
We were able to get back.
Yeah.
Brother!
Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!
Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!
I'm so glad to see you're safe!
That hurts, Al!
Your armor's hurting me!
It's just that I'm so glad to see you're alive...
You're right.
Sorry.
For worrying you.
But where the heck are we?
What a surprise.
Humans came out of his stomach?
Hohen...heim?!
An arm and a leg made of steel, and a suit of armor.
Are you the Elric Brothers?
It's not him?
Are you mistaking me for somebody?
Hang on...
Hohen...
Don't tell me you're talking about Van Hohenheim?
What is your relationship with him?
He's... our dad.
Dad?!
What a surprise! He ended up having kids?!
But aren't your last names Elric?
Elric is our mother's maiden name!
I see.
So, where is he now?
Hell if I know!
But more importantly, who the hell are you?!
You look just like Hohenheim!
There's no way he'd die.
Listen to me!
And he's even had kids...
Brother, this man is...
Oh? You're injured?
And you're missing your left arm.
How's that?
Ow!
A broken bone, huh?
I-It's fixed.
Hey!
Oww!
Now for your ribs.
You two are important to us.
Don't be too reckless with your bodies, okay?
He used alchemy without a single hand motion.
And he didn't make the rest of my armor thinner, either...
In other words, it's not equivalent exchange.
Who the hell are you?
It's unreal! How could your insides be in such a state?!
I'm going to ask you the same exact question.
Who are you?
You can eat him.
Okay!
H-Hang on!
He's my friend!
I'm a human sacrifice, so don't kill him for my sake. Okay?
That's not my problem.
He's useless to me.
What did you say?!
Brother, the homunculi call him "Father".
He's the one who created them.
What?!
Even though he patched us up...
I don't like it.
Your attitude...
You're the same as those who laugh at humans for being foolish.
Do you consider insects crawling about the Earth to be foolish?
Even if insects struggle, the difference between you and them is so great that you don't exactly give a damn.
That's precisely how I feel about you humans.
I appreciate you healing our wounds,but I don't think I can get along with you!
Seems you're the cause of everything!
I'll take care of you quickly.
I can't be worrying about the small fry!
You're calling me small fry now, runt?
Runt?!
I've got their leader!
Ling!
What is going on?!
How can he use alchemy without a single hand motion?!
What a waste of time.
We can't use alchemy?!
Ed! Al!
What did that geezer do?!
Why...
Why can't we use alchemy?!
Seriously, these tiny beings are unbelievable.
They start to think they're at the top of the world as soon as they gain some power.
They don't even know what exactly they're using.
Do you really think all this prosperity was created with the powers of humans only?
How laughable, fools.
What the hell are you talking about?!
You promised you'd tell me as soon as we got out!
What?
I don't remember making promises with you insects.
You bastard...
You're talking too much, Envy.
Yeah, yeah...
He could be good for the job.
I may be able to create another pawn.
That's... a philosopher's stone!
What?!
So you're planning to do it, huh?
Do what?
He's creating a homunculus.
He's going to inject the philosopher's stone into him.
If all goes well, a homunculus with a human base will be complete.
Well, most humans end up dying because they aren't capable of fighting the stone's power.
Like I'll let you!
Let go, Envy!!
Dammit, what's going on?!
Why can't we use alchemy?!
Hey, you!
Geezer! Stop it!
He has people waiting for his return!
Let go!!!
Humans can't shoot me if I do this...
Right?
Damn you...
It's fine! Don't shoot!
Don't interfere.
This is fine by me!
What?
I came to this country looking for a philosopher's stone.
And he's just going to give it to me like that.
It's exactly what I wished for!
What the hell are you saying?!
Oh? Sounds interesting.
Then as you wish, it's all yours.
Stop it!
Ling!
I... I told you not...
...to interfere!
It's fine... Just wait for me...
I'm the man who will become the Emperor of Xing...
...Ling Yao!
What the hell is a brat doing here?!
Ah, well.
Let me have your body.
I'll put it to good use.
Fine...
It's all yours!
What?
I'm saying that I'll accept you!
Wouldn't people normally be against it?
I'm going to become the Emperor of Xing.
How do you expect me to do that if I can't even accept a few dozen people in my body?!
I like decisive guys.
But you'd better not regret it.
Regret?
If I return empty-handed, how could I possibly face my servant who cut her own arm off to save me?!
I want power...
Absolute power that will help me protect and gain more!
I knew the risks from the beginning!
I like your greed.
Well then, show me how prepared you are!
Ling?
Huh? Oh, the guy who owned this body?
Sorry, but now it belongs to me, Greed.
Not Ling, but...
Greed?!
You're that Greed?
What do you mean by "that" Greed?
You don't remember?!
The one at Dublith...
Yeah, so what Greed are you talking about?
The Greed that came before you.
Oh, I see.
Well, as you can see,
I'm a different Greed from the one you guys know.
What happened to Ling?
He was an interesting brat.
He accepted me in a matter of seconds.
No way! There's no way he's that easy to take control of!
Answer me! Ling!
Ling!!!
What?
No...
I don't like him...
He's a person, but at the same time, he's not!
You're right, a lot of these guys aren't human.
Shao May!
I'm so glad to see you're safe!
Do you have any idea how worried I was?
Whoa, I don't really get it, but is this some tearful reunion?
It seems they aren't working together with the homunculi.
Fullmetal Alchemist.
Huh? Where?
Where's Sir Edward?
Right there.
I don't see him anywhere!
I'm pointing right at him.
That small one is the Fullmetal Alchemist.
You toyed with my pure heart, you midget!
Speak for yourself, midget!

What did you do to her, Brother?!
He's the Ishbalan I didn't get to eat.
I didn't do a thing!
The disobedient people, huh...
He's the one who uses destructive alchemy and continues to interfere with our plans, right?
Take care of them, Gluttony.
He can't use alchemy right now.
Okay!
What?!
I'll never forgive you!
You stepped all over a maiden's heart,and on top of that, you kidnapped Shao May!
Divine punishment...
...for all of you!!!
Lucky!
We still can't use it!
What gives?!
How can you two use alchemy here?
What do you mean?
Seriously, what's going on?
How can Scar and that little girl...
I have no idea.
No idea, but...
This could be our chance to fill them in.
Scar!
I'll tell you the truth behind the Ishbal rebellion!
The truth?
The death of the child which became the trigger of the rebellion...
...was caused by him, disguised as a military officer!
They're behind it all!
It seems like I'll have to ask you to explain this in detail.
Answer me.
Why did my people have to fall?
Depending on your answer, I'll send you to...
No.
I won't send you to God, where my fellow Ishbalans reside!
Think of yourselves as undeserving of eternal rest or redemption!!!
Wow, amazing!
Not bad for a human.
Greed, get rid of the intruders.
Yeah, yeah...
I refuse to believe it, Ling!
I'm Greed.
That's...
Could that be Ling from the Yao clan?
A little girl!
Soft body!
Hey you, how can you use alchemy?
Yes, you really are using it.
Human destruction...
No, decomposition.
A second later, and I would have been...
Mr. Scar!
Shao May... Run...
You're mine!
Are you okay?!
I never asked you to save me...
What are you talking about?!
They're ruthless toward humans who are of no benefit to them.
Hurry up and get out of here!
There's way too many of them!
You two didn't run away?!
Scar, could you take this girl and get out of here?
You're going to let me escape?
Even if I killed those doctors...
Yeah, I want to beat the hell out of you.
To be honest, I don't even want to ask you for any favors.
But right now, it's more important to take this girl somewhere safe.
What will you do?
Apparently, my brother and I are important to them in some way.
Even if we stay here, they won't kill us.
Right now, I won't be able to protectthat girl and escape from here at the same time.
And I don't have the slightest intention of running away, either!
He decomposed water?!
Geez, let me know before you do stuff like that!
How reckless!
Igniting hydrogen? That's clever of you.
Where is he?
Where did he go?!
I don't know!
Gluttony, track him by scent!
You're out of lives?!
You've died too much!
That was a nice kick.
I think this'll be more fun than I expected.
You stupid prince!
Come back to your senses!
I'm Greed.
I don't care!
Give Ling back his body.
No can do!
What are you, an idiot?!
What are you going to do about your country?!
What about Lan Fan?!

Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!
Father! I got him.
Take him upstairs, where Wrath is.
Seriously... Always screwing around with us...
As long as you guys behave, we won't do a thing.
Brother.
He...
Ling...
...is inside of him.
You used up your regeneration abilities, huh?
Worry not, my son.
I will recreate you.
With your memories, of course.
Humans in chaos, struggle and writhe in agony.
Because that serves as proof that one is alive.
And struggle and kneel before me.
Next time, Fullmetal Alchemist:
Episode 29, The Fool's Struggle.
Will the man who had his limbs twisted be able to stand again?What the hell is going on?
What happened?!
I don't know.
I heard Colonel Mustang did something.
Are you serious?
Well, it's just a rumor I heard.
Hey! Turn on the radio!
"Radio Capital"!
Radio Capital?
Yeah! There's something crazy going on!
That station is so lame.
Just do it!
Before the military stops the broadcast!
Hurry!




Episode 53, Flames of Revenge.
So they pointed a gun at you to shoot you dead?
That's right.
He said, "Kill her along with Colonel Mustang's men."






Is this truly the real Madam?
I recognize this voice, though. She's real.



You've gotta be kidding me!
Poor thing...
I hope Selim's safe and sound.

A coup d'etat, they say!

Do you think anyone other than Bradley would be able to keep this nation together?


Mustang, huh...?


Have you still not told her that Selim is a homunculus?

How could we?
She doesn't even know that her husband is currently missing.


We hadn't told you this yet, Madam,
but the thing is, the train that the FÃ¼hrer President was on yesterday in the east was bombed by someone.
What?
He is currently missing.
Madam Bradley!
Are you all right?!
I-It appears as though Madam Bradley is feeling ill due to shock.
But the FÃ¼hrer President has gone missing?What could this mean?
Colonel Mustang has always been leery of the upper echelon,
and was anticipating that they'd pull something.
And that's when the FÃ¼hrer President's train was bombed,
and on top of that, an order to shoot the Madam was given.
Everything is clear now.
There is a faction in the upper echelon that wants to get rid of the FÃ¼hrer President.
Fool!
Hurry up and stop the broadcast!
Be well-prepared for the consequences if you refuse!
But we can't!
They've taken hostages, and we can hardly move due to the fact that they've got a gun on us!
And for starters, there are so many of them that we don't know what to do!
Let me talk to Mustang!
I'll talk to him directly!
Huh?
The... Colonel?
Don't shoot!
Forgive me! Please!
How did you like my acting?
It was perfect!
Okay, keep the show airing!
Sir!
Like we can let a scoop like this go!


So it wasn't the Colonel who planned the coup d'etat.


This... voice!


That damned Mustang.
Now that Bradley isn't around, he's exploiting the hell out of the FÃ¼hrer President's influence.
And bringing up words like 'justice'...
It would be nice if the people would take his bait.
You sounded like you're used to this kind of stuff.
I'm surprised you could use a silly and vague word like 'justice'.
It's fine.
Everyone loves justice.
She's right.
The first person to say it wins.
What the hell is going on?
I heard it's not Mustang and his men's doing.
Is that really true?
Roy Mustang is telling the truth.
We just arrived here from the east,
but there was a huge ruckus over thereabout the FÃ¼hrer President's train being blown up.
Do the people at Central still not know about it?
The highest-ranking man in the nation is missing, and they still haven't bothered to tell its people anything?
So it really 
Who's the mastermind?
If Radio Capital happens to be ambushed and the Madam gets killed,
it's obviously the upper echelon who's behind it all!
What happened to Selim?!
He's probably being taken hostage!
I hope he's still alive...
What the hell are the guards doing?!
Sir!
Apparently, the enemy was in possession of more firearms than they'd expected,
and they're putting up a bitter fight.
There has to be limit to how many firearms they can carry!
We have a call from the guards.
Here, sir.
What took you so long to contact us?!
What is going on over there?!
Over!
W-We had no idea the men from Briggs were in possession of such-
H-Hey!
W-Will we be okay?
There's no way they'll take control of this place, right?
Of course!
Seriously... what fools.
They're going to have to bring in something like a tank to-
Huh?
What?!
Shall I lend you a hand, Fullmetal?
Colonel!
Looks like you've made some new friends.
Scar.
But wow, this place brings back memories, Lieutenant.
It reminds me of your crying face.
I'd like to see honest tears like that from you again someday.
I thought you despised liquids.
Since they make you useless.
Save the chatting for later!
Take them down!
Don't you order me around!
Roger!
We need to defeat these pale things, right?
It's useless, Lieutenant!
Bullets aren't enough to bring them down!
That again?!
Why does this always happen?
Homunculi?
No, their wounds aren't recovering.
But they don't die.
Must be the power of a philosopher's stone.
They are enemies, Fullmetal.
Running around like a cockroach...!
Seems like he doesn't want me going this way.
That sensation also grows larger as I go...
It has to be...!
Is that you, May?!
Envy!
You guys...!
Fool!
Why didn't you return to your country?!
But...
B-
Because...!
It's fine. Don't cry.
I'm so sorry, Mister Scar!
Man...
Human traits like this make my skin crawl.
But wow, looks like you guys showed them who's boss.
The Fullmetal Alchemist and the Flame Alchemist.
In addition, Scar.
The shitty chimeras I owe a favor to from up north are with you too.
Now... I wonder who I should take care of first.
So you're Envy?
You're the homunculus that can change form, right?
Oh, you know about me?
Nice to meet you, Colonel Mustang.
Wait, huh?
Is this okay, Scar?
He's a State Alchemist who turned Ishbal into hell.
You're right.
What, you're all buddy-buddy now?
This is boring.
Show me something more muddy and disgusting.
I find enjoyment in watching you pieces of trash shrieking like animals.
I don't have time to entertain your vulgar hobbies.
Vulgar?
Well then, let me ask.
Don't you humans also love watching people's unhappiness and watching fools dance?
Isn't that why you're always fighting wars?
True, it is indeed entertaining to watch fools dance like madmen.
It's especially entertaining to watch fools like you homunculi dance.
Well, I answered your question.
Now it's time for you to answer mine.
Who killed Maes Hughes?
Answer me, homunculus.
Maria Ross.
The one you burned to a crisp.
Wrong.
It wasn't her.
So you basically burned an innocent woman alive?!
Nice one!
You're terrible!
So, how did you explain it to her family?
Did you cry and beg for mercy?
Or did you perhaps refrain from saying anything because you were afraid of how furious they'd be?
Were you never taught to shut your mouth, moron?!
I'm starting to get tired of asking you homunculi the same question.
Simply state the truth,
you moron!
Who killed Hughes?
Congratulations, Colonel Mustang!
You finally found the real culprit.
I can't imagine Hughes getting killed by a moron like you.
'Moron'?
Morons are what you'd call...
...idiots like Hughes...
...who'd fall for dumb shit like this!
Your face changed!
I love that expression!
Hughes had a great look on his face when I killed him too!
Yeah, that face!
The despair of being killed by someone who looks just like his beloved wife...
It was just...
...the best!
It's decided.
You're the one who killed Hughes.
That's all I needed to know.
You don't need to say anything else, Envy.
Let's start this by...
...reducing your tongue to ashes.
Scar.
Fullmetal.
Leave this place to me.
He's 
G-Gotcha.
Well then, we'll leave this place to you and go on-
Who gave you permission to pass?
I still need to repay the debt you guys gave me up north-
Do you have the time to be speaking to others while facing me?
Seems like there's quite a lot of fat on that blabbering tongue of yours.
It burns quite well, Envy.
Lieutenant, will it really be okay-
Go, Edward.
We'll figure something out.
But...
Go, Edward Elric.
Don't you have something you need to take care of?
Come on, let's go, Ed.
Hey-
You son of a....!
The Colonel will be fine.
Finishing off a homunculusshould be a piece of cake for him.
That's not the issue I'm worried about.
Huh?
Then what is?
I see, so you've been seeking revenge for Hughes' death the entire time.
What a beautiful friendship!
Stay back, Lieutenant.
Out of respect for that beautiful friendship, I'll fight you seriously.
But I can't really hold back when fighting in this state.
Don't blame me for any-
How does it feel to have all the liquids within your eyes boil?
The pain goes far beyond anything you could possibly imagine, doesn't it.
You little-
It was nice of you to make yourself a bigger target.
Did you think you could beat me if you increased your size?
Moron.
Get up, monster.
Hurry up and regenerate.
I'll have you repeat this suffering until you're dead.
That's...
That's right.
He's the one who burned Lust to death!
Wait!
Colonel!
You wait here, Lieutenant!
I'll dispose of him on my own!
Yeah, I think it's this way.
These things look creepy.
They're almost like veins.
I keep having this nasty feeling, like I'm having heartburn.
Not surprising.
There's a huge cluster of energy ahead.
Cluster of energy?
Would you get it if I described it as an insane number of people crawling about?
Not really, but I do understand that it feels disgusting.
I'd hate to encounter an enemy in a place like this.
Scar, do you mind?
Is this about the Flame Alchemist?
Because I once lost my soul after engulfing myself in flames of revenge, I can understand well.
If he goes on...
...he'll end up reducing even his own heart with the flames of wrath.
Where did you go, Envy?!
Damn him...!
If you don't come out, you'll be seeing another huge explosion from me!
Yo, Roy.
You're human after all! Let this throw you into confusion!
You'd set your best friend aflame without hesitation?!
Hughes is dead.
He's no longer here.
Your actions do nothing more than feeding oil to flames!
Damn you!!
Don't get so cocky!!
Again...!
My eyes... My eyes...!
Fool.
You came at me, thinking I wouldn't use much firepower if you were near me?
Unfortunately for you, I can pinpoint.
Don't you dare underestimate me!
Colonel, I'm going to have to disobey your orders.
He ran away again.
You're disobeying my orders, Lieutenant.
I apologize.
But I couldn't just stand there and wait...
Where is Envy?
I lost him.
This place is like a maze.
Don't leave my side, Lieutenant.
Now that you're here, I'm going to ask for your help.
From the moment someone is born,
they gradually become more and more human as time goes by.
And what has been accumulated eventually becomes complete as a strong self.
However...
Next time, Fullmetal Alchemist:
Episode 54, Beyond the Raging Fire.
Peer once more at your heart.blue scene
~ENG~
The forthcoming "Promised Day".
People are continuing to prepare for the day that will determine their fate.
Time passes by, and it is now spring.
At last, the Promised Day is about to arrive.
Episode 46, The Creeping Shadow.
Some sort of festival?
It's the Festival of the Sheep, a local specialty of Resembool that takes place every spring.
Sorry to ask something like this on an important day, but we'd like to replenish our water supplies.
Sure thing.
Have all the water you want.
Okay! Bring out the water tanks!
One, two...
There.
Looks like there's no one home.
Here we are, miss.
Home sweet home.
Wow, this place is full of automails.
Please don't touch the ones that aren't finished yet.
It's so dusty in here...
What happened?!
Edward Elric?!
Intruders?!
Oww!!
What the hell are you guys doing?
Ling?!
If I recall, you two are working for Kimblee!
Huh?
You guys are... from Briggs!
You chased us all the way down here?!
Wait! Wait! Wait! Wait!
Put down your guns!
Hey Ed... just 
Long story.
Besides, what were you doing in my room?!
I just wanted to eat while enjoying the outside view every once in a while!
I said, put down your gun!
Quit yelling!
This dog is so loud.
Get the hell out of my room!!
You had me worried sick.
I know.
Glad to see you're safe.
A-Al isn't with you?
Al's at the station!
He's with Major Miles.
But they're about to depart soon.
If you hurry, you may be able to make it in time.
Something wrong?
Aren't you going to go see him?
We're fugitives wanted by Central.
It would be bad if someone were to see us.
But...
The Festival of the Sheep, huh...
Sure brings back memories.
We're going to be departing soon.
Roger.
I hope you will have found your body by the next time you return to this town.
Thank you.
Winry?
Welcome home.
Thanks.
Sorry for worrying you.
Looks like we have more of you dowdy people in here now.
Sorry for causing such a ruckus earlier.
We're soldiers from Briggs.
We were dispatched as Miss Winry's bodyguards.
You're Ling... right?
What?
You know this dude?
The name's Greed.
Nice to meet ya.
Huh?
And so, these guys are currently working for me.
What made you come here?
To make sure his automail's all tuned up and stuff.
You know, to prepare for the worst.
Take a look at him later, Winry.
You made all his latest stuff, so I can't do the fine-tuning.
Sure, no problem.
Oh...
So the people of Liore have gotten back up on their feet again.
That's a relief.
It's been bugging me, to tell you the truth.
So, why is Al with Major Miles?
I heard the people from Briggs are going to do something at the joint exercises in the east.
Al volunteered to join them, saying there might be something he could help out with.
Oh...
Your dad went to Central ahead of him.
I heard he's in some slum called 'Kanama', so you should meet up with him to get the details.
The Promised Day is coming up... right?
I heard about that from Greed as well.
It's a day when we may be able to get our bodies back, or a day when a great tragedy will strike this nation.
Hey...
Yeah?
Take Granny and Den and escape to another country.
Are you telling me to run away?!
Telling those close to you to escape makes it sound like you've already given up!
Can't you stop the threat to this country?!
I'll stop them!
But there's a one in a million chance that it may not work!
Be 100% sure, then!
They're planning to do something terrible, aren't they?!
Beat them to a pulp and protect our country!
And while you're at it, get your bodies back and return safe and sound!
I'll do 
Geez, you make it sound like a walk in the park.
What's this?!
You're not acting like yourself-
Hey, Ed!
Gosh, you're such an annoying woman.
Ed!
Fine woman you have up there.
She just sounds like she wants everythingin the world. Quite the greedy one.
When you get too greedy, it comes back to bite you in the behind.
See this?
I wanted to bring back the dead, and this was my reward.
You really think so?
"I long to see someone who died","I want to be rich", "I want women"...
"I want to protect the world"...
They're all desires.
In other words, wishes.
If you ask me, there's neither 'right' nor 'wrong' when it comes to greed.

You're leaving 
We were planning on leaving today anyway.
Thanks for the tune-up.
If you ever happen to see Hohenheim, deliver Trisha's message for her.
Sure, whatever.
Ed! I...
You stay hidden.
I'll come home after putting an end to everything on the Promised Day, so...
...wait for us with a freshly-baked apple pie. Deal?
Deal!
Work today took forever.
But hey, is this really what we should be focusing on right now?
The Promised Day is coming up!
Not much else we can do!
Doctor Marcoh and Scar haven't met up with us yet!
Geez... where the hell are they?!
Doctor!
Hey, it's you guys.
"Hey, it's you guys"?!
Where have you two been all this time?!
Sorry about that.
Let's head over to Central.
But something feels a little off.
We used to be soldiers, but now we're working with an Ishbalan.
Yeah it does.
For us, Amestris is our birthplace.
We've got family here as well.
But Scar, who used to rebel against the nation, is now working to protect it.
Don't get the wrong idea.
My goal is not to protect this country.
I'm working to change it.
I'm working in order for the people of this country to recognize the existence of the Ishbalans,
a race that they denied.
In order to change the world,you must start by changing yourself.
That's how it is, Amestrians.
Ishbalans?!
Why?!
We weren't just dawdling about for months doing nothing.
They're comrades who share our goal.
May this year's exercises be productive as always, Lieutenant General.
I'm glad we're doing it in the east this year.
Joint exercises in the north are pretty tough for us.
Everything's ready on our end.
Ours, too.
Unfortunately, a little problem has popped up...
That being?
Little miss Bradley is here to observe as well.
I was expecting someone high up to watch over the practice, since it's right before the Promised Day...
We'll just have to figure something out.
There it is again...
The delay between visions is gradually getting shorter.
I have to hurry.
I need to get my body back, or...
Yeah, I can smell him!
Smells like the Fullmetal Alchemist's little brother!
Running away?
This isn't good!
I'm in no condition to fight!
What's... this...?!
Talk about great timing...!
I'm going to have you keep quiet until the Promised Day,
Alphonse Elric.
Good evening, Major General.
I've got no tea for the likes of you.
I may be able to take you out for dinner soon.
So you finally plan to fulfill the promise from forever ago?

You could fit a company... no, even a full battalion in here.
If something may happen to me,
you can have the entire mansion.
It won't fit into my coffin, after all.
You're not going to give it to your brother?
I'd say you're the better choice... by a hair.
That's quite an honor.
Belatedly...
This is to congratulate you for becoming the head of the Armstrong family.
Hyacinths...?
"Selim Bradley is a homunculus."
Are you aware of what the Hyacinth represents?
I'm not.
Feminine beauty.
I don't need your flowers!
Well, if you'll excuse me, Major General.
You amateur.

This is annoying.
We should just aim a cannon at Bradley's tower and be done with it.
Please don't.
Major Miles.
So we still don't have a clue as to where Alphonse Elric disappeared to...
Yes. We're still searching, but...
Could it be that he was captured?
And the Promised Day is tomorrow...
Sire.
Major General Hakuro has arrived.
Sire, there's something I need to inform you about Lieutenant General Grumman-
A coup d'etat using the Eastern Army?
We've already planned for such eventualities.
No, the joint practice is a bait.
The Ishbalan remnants will commit a terrorist act in Central,
now that defenses have weakened since Your Highness is here in the east.
Lieutenant General Grumman will use "terrorist suppression" as a pretense to invade Central.
He's planning on taking advantage of the confusion to take over Central Headquarters,
with the help of Colonel Mustang.
Just as Major General Hakuro stated,
many Ishbalans have infiltrated Central vicinity over the past few days.
I'm returning to Central.
I'll leave matters here in your hands.
Roger.
That damned Mustang... planning something outrageous.
I thought we took care of him when weseparated him from all of his useful men...
The train stopped.
What's going on?
Sheep crossing.
Dammit, we're in a rush for time...!
Hey, they just left us!
What?!
What's going on?!
Hey! Make him stop!
The sheep on the tracks have been exterminated.
We'll be heading to Central as planned.
Let's go!
The Colonel is awaiting our arrival.
Yes, sir!
Dammit!
You played right into their hands, Major General Hakuro.
The train that was carrying the FÃ¼hrer President has been bombed!
What?!
Everything begins tomorrow.
Time to make our move,
Second Lieutenant Breda, Master Sergeant Fuery.
No need for the "Second Lieutenant", ma'am.
We're just plain old deserters now.
There goes my future...
We'll have the Colonel take responsibility after everything's over.






























The FÃ¼hrer President?!
There's no way King Bradley could die...!
We can't make assumptions just yet!
What has the investigation turned up?!
The squadron has yet to reach the scene of the accident!
As soon as their leader is gone, this happens.
Make them hurry up!
Quit yelling!

This is not my job!
In the end, they're nothing but an undisciplined mob.
But...!
This isn't the time for this!

The supreme commander is missing!
I know that!
This may be my chance...
I never expected someone as important as you to visit this place.
Calm down, everyone.
I'm still here.
What lurks in the shadows?
Demons? Beasts? Monsters?
A black gust of wind saves our heroes who are faced with a crisis.
Next time, Fullmetal Alchemist:
Episode 47, Messenger of Darkness.
Shed light on the heart of man. To an engulfing darkness.What's the matter?
The soldiers outside want to start negotiating.
We're only sending one man! He's on his way now!
Be sure not to shoot!
Hands above your head!
Do anything suspicious and we won't hesitate!
He's fine.
Let him through.
He's someone we can trust.
Second Lieutenant!!
I wonder if there's any way for me to see my husband right now...
You mustn't!
There's no telling what could happen to you.
There's still a chance that the army is currently under control of the anti-Bradley faction.
Please be patient for a little longer.
I see...
You're right.
Episode 60, Heaven's Eye, Earth's Gate.
So, you say you refuse to acknowledge Truth?
That's exactly right!
You also seem to think you've wonafter gathering all the human sacrifices,
but you won't have your way with us so easily!
Nonsense.
Can you stand? We're going to get out of here.
Don't bother trying.
All of you are already inside my belly.
What on earth is this?
Is the 'Father' guy inside of that thing?


May!
Midget!
Hey you, with all the eyes! You're immortal, aren't you?
So you're not going to deny it.
Sir Alphonse, let me handle him.
H-Hey, you won't be able to take him on alone!
Nope, I can use Eastern Alchemy.
I get that you'll still be able to use alchemy even after he seals it off, but...
I'm going to need you two to take on the little homunculus.
Easier said than done...
He forced the colonel to open the gate...?
Then why didn't he do that to begin with?
Fullmetal.
When he dragged me into the transmutation,
he said, "I didn't really want to have to use this method, but we're fairly short on time."
Meaning it carries a great risk for them.
Probably.
Guess it's worth a shot.
All right! We can use alchemy!
He's running?!
He used to always avoid them using his shadows!
We may have a chance!
Right!
Messing up my house again? You evil kids.
Your immortality is mine!
You don't belong here.
Out!
Watch out, little girl!
He can transmute without-
May!
Just what on blazes is going on?
We still can't get in touch with headquarters.
Reporting in!
Several Ishbalans have appeared within the city!
They've engaged in combat with the guards in-
You-
My apologies.
We don't really have the time to explain.
Forgive us.
No! No!!
Help me! Someone, help me!
My apologies, lady.
We mean no harm, so please tell us...
This is the house located here on this map, right?
It's starting to get really dark.
I wonder if everyone's doing their job...
You sure this is the right place?
Yeah, positive.
Great.
Now...
The rest is up to you, Scar.
It's nice to be face to face with death every once in a while.
Right now, the only thing in my mind is the fact that I'll fight to the death with you.
Social status, career, origin,
race, gender, name...
...none of that matters.
Not being bound by anyone and fighting just for the sake of it.
How astounding.
I've finally reached this stage.
What's wrong?!
Is this all you've got?!
That's not enough!
Hardly enough!
Destroy me, nameless one!
You look surprised.
I don't blame you.
If you were to ask me some time ago,
even I wouldn't have imagined that I'd be using something like this.
I had always been thinking about what I was capable of doing.
And this was the conclusion I'd reached.
It's the transmutation circle of reconstruction that I obtained from my brother's research documents!
You humans just continue to struggle.
May!
Shit!
Al, you go help May.
What about Pride?!
Leave him to me.
I can take him!
Roger that!
Little girl!
You keep your mouth shut, Hohenheim.
Sir Alphonse...
What's the matter now?
Those are some weak blows!
Don't get the wrong idea.
Until you perform your duty...
You need to keep me alive, eh?!
Then I'll just kick both of your asses before that happens!
"Kick our asses"?
Do try.
Since you have a small stature, you've always been fighting against people larger than you.
Thus, you have little experience fighting against those who are smaller than yourself!
I apologize beforehand if I hit you, Dad!
You little...!
I do admit that I've always been fighting against people who were bigger than me!
And that's exactly why...
...I know how little guys tend to attack!
Master!
Transmuting with no movement? That's kind of annoying.
It's almost time.
Playtime ends here.
Time for you all to get to work.
It's pitch dark...
Hurry...
Hurry and take us to the middle of the transmutation circle...
Hurry!
We can't stay here!
Quit throwing a fit!
Hurry up and take me to the center!
Hurry!
We're going to get devoured!
Hurry!!
The time has come!
Have you all ever thought of this planet as one life form?
Well, it would be more accurate to call it a system rather than a life form.
A system that records a tremendous amount of information taken from the universe,
which is incomparable to the tiny amount that each of you humans possess.
If one were to open that gate,
how much power do you suppose they would gain?
Ever thought of it?
I'm going to open that gate here and nowusing these human sacrifices!
So that's the center!
Greed!
The center of the world belongs to me!
The world is mine!
He did it.
I knew you'd come, Greed, my son.
You're the avarice that was born from me.
It's only natural that you'd want everything I'd want.
Ed!
The true center of the world...
...is right here!
Damn you...!
W-What's going on?!
This is...!
That's right, allow the gates to fight each other!
Repel one another!
What an immense amount of energy!
I'm almost unable to hold it down by myself.
And with this power, I shall open the gate of the planet!
What on earth?!
Win...ry...
What's... going on...?
Miss Pinako, what's...
Hohenheim... I'm going to punch you...
...when you come back...
Ed...
E... d...
God!!
Respond to my soul!
Come!
That's right, come!
I shall no longer be chained down by You!
I shall drag You down to earth and make You a part of me!
Humans.  Get down on your knees, if you refer to that as God.
But if you do not, then fight with your pride on the line.
Next time, Fullmetal Alchemist:
Episode 61, One Who Devours God.
"God" is an invention of those with nobody else to turn to.


Are you guys street performers or something?
Where in the world did you get that idea?
Am I wrong?
Thanks for the meal.
Hey now, sir!
Sorry about that, we'll fix it.
"Fix", you say?
Well, just watch.
Well then, here I go!
How's that?
Now that's quite a surprise.
You're able to perform miracles, as well?
What the heck are you talking about?
We're alchemists.
That's the first time I've seen anything like that.
You've never heard of us, the Elric Brothers, before?
"Elric"?
Actually, I have.
The Fullmetal Alchemist, Edward Elric!
Oh, so you're that rumored genius alchemist.
Ah, I get it! Your other name is "Fullmetal" because of this suit!
No... You have the wrong person...
Huh? That little guy over there?
Who are you calling a pea-sized runt?!
Episode 3, City of Heresy.

So, what the heck is this broadcast?
I-It's the High Priest Cornello...
He came here a few years ago and preached to us about the path of God.
"God will grant eternity to the living and resurrection to the dead."
And proof of it all are the miracles that he produces.
"Resurrection to the dead", eh?
Sounds fishy to me.
That's what they were talking about, huh?
What do you think?
It's pretty obvious from that transmutation response that it's alchemy.
But he's totally ignoring the concept of equivalent exchange.
It's a rule that you can only produce something from matter of equal value.
He changed a flower to a mineral, too.
Brother, could it be...
Yeah. It could be...
Bingo.
God... please listen to my wish...
Please bring back-
Ah, so this is Mr. Leto.
Are you interested in the religion of Leto?
Nah. Unfortunately, I'm an atheist.
That's not good.
Believing and honoring God,and living in gratitude and hope...
How glorious.
If you believe...
I'm sure you'll grow taller!
What did you say?!







She didn't mean it in a bad way!
"Resurrection to the dead"...
Do you seriously believe something like that?
Yes.
Water, 35L.
Carbon, 20kg.
Ammonia, 4L.
Lime, 1.5kg.
Phosphorus, 800g.
Salt, 250g.
Niter, 100g.
And others.
...What?
Those are the ingredients that make up an average adult human body.

You really think that praying would solve something that even science couldn't solve?
"Pray and believe, and your wishes shall be."
And by the way,
you can buy these basic ingredients at the market with a kid's pocket money.
Humans are made pretty cheaply, aren't they?
People are not things. Those words are blasphemy to our creator.
You'll suffer divine punishment for that.
Alchemists are scientists, after all.
We don't believe in creators or the existence of a God.
Looking for the solution to the creation principle of this world and pursuing the truth.
It's pretty ironic we're the closest things to Godin a sense, even though we have no need for him.
Are you saying you're on the same level as God?
How arrogant!
Arrogant, huh?
I remember this from a mythical tale.
"The hero who gets too close to the sun shall havehis wax wings plucked and be dropped to the earth."
Brother.
Lady, will Mr. Leto save a scientist like me?Even though I was thinking something like that?
Of course. He will accept reformers at any time.
High Priest, there are people who wish to have a meeting with you.
Two of them. A child and a man in a suit of armor.
They call themselves the "Elric Brothers".
I'm busy. Dismiss them.
Actually, wait... Did you say... the Elric Brothers?
Yes, that's what they said...
This is going to be trouble.It's the Fullmetal Alchemist, Edward Elric.
The... man in the armor?!
Yeah, probably.
What is a State Alchemist doing here?
Could it be that our plan has been...
Those dogs of the military must have a good sense of smell.
This way, please.
The High Priest is a very busy man, and he usually cannot find time for such matters, but...
You folks are lucky.
Sorry for the trouble. I'll try to make it quick.
Yeah, let's get this over with as quickly as possible.
Priest, what are you doing?!
Rose, these people are heathens who are trying to ensnare the High Priest. They are evil.
No, that's...
So... let's get this over with quick!
Strike!
So noisy!
Welcome to the holy order, Fullmetal Alchemist.
Sir Cornello!
Looks like some of us were rather hasty.
I apologize for their rudeness.
It really doesn't feel like an apology when you're looking down at us from a high place like that.
Are you here for our dogma?
I have a lot of things I want to learn from you... say,a method for tricking your followers with petty alchemy.
I have no idea what you're talking about.
I can't have you putting my miracles and alchemy on the same level.
How's this? Can this be achieved through alchemy?
That's precisely what I'm concerned about.
For some strange reason, you can performtransmutations while clearly ignoring the rules.
Which is why it isn't alchemy-
So I was thinking...
If you had the legendary amplifier that allows alchemists to perform the impossible, it would be possible in your case.
What?
Yep. Frankly, the philosopher's stone. Isn't that what your ring is made of?
That was a long search.
This is just an ordinary ring.
God has allowed me to perform miracles.
Still gonna play dumb?
Guess I'll have to get my hands on you and ask your body for the truth.
You seem to be an incorrigible heathen.
Rose.
Y-Yes?
Pick up that pistol.
Yes, sir...
Now shoot the Fullmetal Alchemist.
I... can't do that...
My words are God's words.
This is God's will.
Rose, shoot him.
What's wrong?
Who was the one...
...who rescued you from your despairafter you lost your love in an accident last year?
It was you, Sir Cornello...
That's right. It was I who rescued you.
And what did I promise you?
That you'd revive him!
Umm... I'm not the one you're supposed to be aiming at...

Wait, 
Sorry... I have to.
He's a swindler.
No, he isn't!
He's going to revive him with his miracles!
Then shoot me.
Al!
Good work. God is rejoicing.
Now, shoot the other.
Man, you make your followers do terrible things.
What?!
What's going on?!
As you can see...
...this is how it is.
An empty suit of armor!
This, itself, is evidence of their evil!
They must be eliminated!
Is this your first time seeing a chimera?
So you made something like this with your philosopher's stone, too, eh?
I should probably arm myself...
Without a transmutation circle?!
I guess your title of "State Alchemist" has to come with 
But...
How do you like those claws that cut through iron?!
Just kidding.
Unfortunately, my leg is a bit special.
Bite him to death!
What's wrong, stupid cat?
Get a good taste of it!
That arm...
...and a brother without his body...
Ah, I see now.
Fullmetal Alchemist... you...
You've done it, haven't you?!
Get down here, third-rate!
I'll show you the difference in our skill!
Get down here, third-rate!
I'll show you the difference in our skill!
Rose, these guys have committed the greatest taboo alchemists can commit.
Human transmutation.
They tried to revive the dead.
"The hero who gets too close to the sun shall havehis wax wings plucked and be dropped to the earth."
No way...
This is the body of a sinner who encroached upon God's territory.
Rose, are you really prepared to be like this?
Edward Elric.
And you call yourself a State Alchemist? You make me laugh.
Shut the hell up!
You can't do anything withoutthe philosopher's stone, third-rate!
High Priest, please give us the stone before you get hurt.
How ridiculous! Fools who stepped into God's territory!
I'll send you to his side, once and for all!
Nah, God seems to hate me,so he'll probably send me back even if I went.
Al!
What are you doing?! After them!
They are heathens who bring evil to the order! Catch them!
Stop right there!
What do you think you can do unarmed, kid?
Just give up before you get hurt.
Don't let your guard down just because he's a kid!
Out of the way!
Get it now, Rose?
Cornello shot at us, even though you were with us.
But that's because you two...
Is that story true?
We just wanted to see Mom's smiling face again.
But the transmutation failed.
It didn't even look human.
We learned our mistake the hard way.
People cannot be revived... even our mom.
That's not true... because...
The fundamental basis of alchemy is the concept of equivalent exchange.
The price we paid for the human transmutation was huge.
Brother lost his left leg, and I lost my body.
Can you see it?
Brother drew it with his blood.
It must have been painful for him,after having his left leg taken away.
But Brother affixed my soul to this suit and gave up his right arm as compensation.
I want to fix my brother's body.
Brother wants to get my body back, too.
But we may die trying.
That's the path we've chosen.
But, Sir Cornello could...
Rose...
Even if you two can't, he could...
He could do it! He will!
You brat! You'd better be prepared!
Old man, let's have a heart-to-heart talk.
I just want to know the secret behind that stone.
Or should I call for the army to mobilize?
To inspect the stone, that is.
Fine.
What do you plan to do with the philosopher's stone?
You don't need that pitiful order if you have the stone, do you?
The order will produce followers that will joyfully give up their lives for me!
They would be an undefeatable army that does not fear even death.
Just watch.
I'm going to be stripping this country away in a few years.
By using the philosopher's stone and my stupid followers!
I guess I could share some of the leftovers with you.
What's so funny?!

Y...
You didn't...
There are no such things as miracles.
They were all thanks to the power of the philosopher's stone.
Y-You...
When did you flip on that switch?!
When?!
From the very beginning.
It's all been leaked, now.
What have you done?!
You brat!!!
Too slow!
Told ya. We're on totally different levels.
I'm invincible!
R-Rebound!
I'm not giving up yet!
I'm... I'm...
God's hand!!!
My words are God's words. This fist is God's fist!
"God's fist", you say?!
If you like it so much, I'll let you have a taste of it!
Shut up!
Now give me the philosopher's stone!
It... broke? What does this mean?
How could the philosopher's stone break? It's supposed to be a perfect substance!
I... I don't know!
I didn't hear about this!
P-P-P-Please don't hurt me!
Please! I was wrong!
So it was a fake?
I can't do anything without the stone! Please, have mercy!!!
I finally thought we'd be able to get our bodies back, and it's...
...fake...
U-Umm, what about me?
Go wherever you want!!!
Yes, sir!
What about the philosopher's stone?
It was a fake.
I see...
And I thought we'd finally be able to get your body back...
Give me the philosopher's stone!
Rose...
Didn't I just say that it was a fake?
And in any case, it broke on its own.
That's a lie!
You're planning to keep it for yourselves, aren't you!
To fix your bodies... right?!
And you want to meet your mother again, too...
Shut up!
The dead cannot be revived...
Never...
Never.
But he said that he'd be able to bring him back...
He said that if I prayed, it would come true.
That a miracle would occur...
What am I supposed to cling to from now on?!
Tell me!
Hey...
Decide that for yourself.
Get up and take a step. Walk forward.
You've got two fine legs on you.
You don't need to cling to anything.
What's going on?!
Let us see the High Priest!
Were you guys tricking us?!
Open this door!!!
My plans... ruined by a brat like that...
Seriously. What a mess.
All you had to do was to wreak a bit of havoc.
You...
Hey, Lust?
Can I eat this guy?
No, Gluttony.
If you eat something like that, you'll get a stomachache.
How dare... How dare you all make fun of me!
You're not needed anymore.
It was just starting to liven up, too.
I guess we have to start over.
Father will get mad at us.
Now, I wonder what we should do next...
Ed and Al visit East City, home of Eastern Headquarters, to report the incident in Liore.
And they meet Shou Tucker,the Sewing-Life Alchemist, and his daughter, Nina.
Next time, Fullmetal Alchemist:
Episode 4, An Alchemist's Distress.
An encounter. Is that the beginning of suffering?This is the bullet used in the murder of Brigadier General Hughes.
.45 caliber, and only one shot was fired.
I'd like to say the murderer was skilled, but it was a close proximity shot.
Not impossible for a woman to do.
What is the caliber of your gun?
.45.
This is your ammunition request application.
Am I right?
It's written here you only needed to be supplied with one shot.
What did you use it for?
As it says right there,
I used it at Research Laboratory 5, while I escorted Edward Elric...
But Research Laboratory 5 is closed down, and there shouldn't be anyone there.
But there were.
...According to you.
Should I order a search for this bullet you supposedly shot?
Research Laboratory 5 is in ruins now due to an unknown explosion.
So the place where you say you usedyour gun is usually unvisited by people,
and even if we wanted to search forthe bullet, it'd be under a heap of rubble...
There's witness testimony stating you left the scene of the crime, on the exact date and time it occurred.
That's ridiculous!
Compose yourself.
What were you doing at the time?
I was on leave that day and at my parents' house.
You can confirm with them.
Testimony from family members or people whom you are close with cannot be accepted as an alibi.
Second Lieutenant Maria Ross is currently being interrogated.
Though you may be her superior, I cannot allow you to see her.
I see...
Major Armstrong!
Sergeant Brosh.
You were here, too, Major?
Yeah. Are you here for Second Lieutenant Ross?
Yes. The truth is-
The truth is, like the lieutenant, I also fired one round at Research Laboratory 5 while escorting the Elric Brothers.
What?
I reported that, but they didn't listen at all.
Episode 17, Cool-Headed Flames.
So they're planning on passing her off as the murderer?
Now that I look closely, you're really scratched up.
Not an easy journey, huh?
Say, what are you going to do now?
Hey...
I wonder...
Mama, don't cry.
What do you want me to do?
What?
No, it's just that you've never asked me for advice about something concerning yourselves...
Oh...
It really scares me.
Both of you are fighting in a place so dangerous that Mr. Hughes was killed.
I got really scared when I thought about that.
Because... you both could die.
And suddenly disappear from my side.
Just like Mom and Dad...
I got really scared when I thought about that.
To be honest, I want you to end your journey.
I want you two to get your bodies back.
But I don't want you to go on any dangerous journeys.
Because...
But...
Sorry.
I don't really know what I want either.
You're really kind, Winry.
Huh?! W-W-What are you saying?
I'm always kind!

Geez Al, what are you saying?
Stop! You're going to scratch me up even more!
There.
Evening paper!
Finally!
What, the paper again?
I'm forced to watch over you all day.
This is about the only thing I can look forward to.
Warrant Officer Falman speaking. I'm calling from an outside line.
Please put me through to Colonel Mustang.
That's right. My code is...
What's the deal?
Airam, George, Oliver, 4649.
It's that lady from back then!
Philosopher's stones...
Ones who have tattoos of Ouroboros...
Homunculus...
How are they...
Brother!
Look at this...
Don't scare me like that.
I... got this from the front desk!
What is it?
What?!
"Second Lieutenant Maria Ross convicted on charges of the murder of Brigadier General Hughes"?!
I don't believe this.
Maybe the colonel or the major might know something.
Aren't you going to tell Winry?
I'll explain it to her later.
I don't like this thing.
Quit complaining. It's kind of like a collar for a dog.
Oh, and I'm going to ask again just to be sure...
Are you really fifteen?
Yeah.
Stop lying.
But it's true...
What's all this?
What's going on?
An intruder!
Please lend us a hand!
What?!
You'd better behave!
Yes, sir!
Weak, weak, weak!
Are you guys even trying?!
What's with this guy?!
Guns aren't working at all!
Move!
You-
Whoa!

But it's awfully boring not being allowed to cut them.
Hello! Guy who's not affected by guns!
Could you let me out of here?
Who are you?
An illegal alien from Xing.
Oh, I see.
Must have been a long trip.
I'll help you if you let me out!
I don't have time to mess around with you...
What country did you say you're from?
Xing of the East.
Come with me.
Thanks.
What?
Hello, Honey!
I've finally found you!
You were at Research Laboratory 5-
I'm glad you remember me.
I think of you every time I see the hole in my right hand you shot through.
Ms. Murderer of Hughes.
That's a misunderstanding!
Is it really?
The paper says it's confirmed.
No way...
At this rate, it looks like you're going to have the guilt pinned on you and get executed by a firing squad.
You're kidding...
There's no way... If they investigate thoroughly-
Make a decision!
Get tortured to death by these guys or escape with me!
Those are the two choices you've got!
That's horrible...
Are those the only choices available?
Looks that way.
God, damn it!
Mom, Dad, I'm sorry!
Fine, I'll escape. Happy?
You'd better escort me, you stupid bone armor!
Wow, you've got spunk.
Women have to have guts!
Yes.
Yes, I understand.
Notify the entire city.
Maria Ross has escaped from jail.
She's with a fiendish partner. Capture her immediately.
If she resists...
...don't hesitate to kill her!
How much longer are we going to run?!
Shut up and keep running!
Second Lieutenant Ross?!
Edward! Alphonse!
Hey! You're that guy from-
And Ling, too?!
Hiya!
What are you guys up to?
That's what 
We don't have much time!
You...
Lady, go straight down that alley to reach the warehouse district!
It's dark enough over there to make your escape!
Second Lieutenant Ross, about Lt. Colonel Hughes...
Hurry up! If the military police finds you, they'll shoot you dead!
Second Lieutenant Ross!
Don't follow her!
Second Lieutenant!
Second Lieutenant Ross!
You're Maria Ross, right?
What?!
Oh, so she did it?
Hey!
Hold it!
Whoa!
We're going, thin-eyes!
You got it!
Ling! Why are you working with a guy like that?!
We'll talk later!
Seriously...
Yo, Fullmetal.
What's the meaning of this...
What's the meaning of this, Colonel?!
Why...
Lt. Colonel Hughes was...
Why would Second Lieutenant Ross...
Why didn't you tell me in the first place?!
Attacking a superior?
Know your place!
You can't, Brother!
Let go of me, Al!
No!
This bastard just killed Second Lieutenant Ross!
Second Lieutenant Ross?
What is this, Colonel?!
There was a kill-on-sight order issued for Maria Ross, an escaped convict.
That's all there is to it.
"That's all"?!
I do apologize for hiding Hughes' death.
But do not object to orders. Do not seek explanation.
Simply obey.
That's what it means to be a soldier!
Colonel Mustang.
Explain the situation to me.
There should have been a notice issued saying if she resists, we could gun her down.
She resisted, so I killed her.
The Brigadier General was a good friend of yours from what I hear.
Yeah.
He was a good man.
It weren't your men who helpedSecond Lieutenant Ross escape from jail, right?
Mine?
Why would I?
Why?
So you could burn her to death like that yourself.
I'd appreciate it if you didn't make assumptions.
I'm truly sorry for not telling you about Brigadier General Hughes' death.
Because of me...
Don't brood over it.
It is not your fault.
So you're all here.
Dr. Nox...
The damage is extensive.
But from a scar on her tooth that was just narrowly left unscathed, we were able to identify her as Maria Ross.
How horrible.
Turning a babe like that into charcoal.
You must have really had something against her, eh, Mr. Mustang?
Are you satisfied you were able to avenge your friend's death?
It makes me sick a hero from the Ishbal Warwould go so far against a little girl.
Colonel, I can't express to you how sorry I am for what my subordinate did.
I had no idea Second Lieutenant Ross would murder...
She's always been honest... hardworking...
And thoughtful...
Looks like you're exhausted, Major.
Why not take a vacation?
Eastern Headquarters, where I used to be stationed, was great.
It lacks the bustle of large cities,and most of all, there are so many beauties.
And so, Mustang was able to avenge his best friend.
And everyone lived happily ever after.
You petered out.
Wasn't the purpose of this mission to make the colonel behave?
Who cares?
The dog ate its bait.
And it seems he's provoking people's antipathy.
His own men may even be disgusted at him.
What's this?
Request for leave.
At this time of the year?
Is something wrong?
No, it's fine. I permit it.
Thank you very much.
Oh, for crying out loud!
Why did you leave this place?! There's no knowing what the colonel will say to me if he finds out!
No one saw me coming back.
That's not the problem here!
You're a poor soldier that's in the hands of a vicious criminal, so it's okay.
Huh?!
Yo, what are you doing?
Sending a signal.
Signal?
And besides, why did you bring back some random stranger?!
Young Master! We've looked all over for you!
Oh wow, that was quick.
More guests.
Hey Elizabeth! How are you?
Thanks for calling all the time.
But won't your scary aide scold you if you slack off too much?
It's all right! She's on leave right now.
Which is why I can call you like this.
What do you think?
This starts as soon as the lieutenant goes on vacation.
I guess she really was...
...His babysitter...
That's right!
I haven't had any days off since I came here.
So I'm thinking about taking a holiday soon.
Oh? Going somewhere?
I've gotten into fishing lately.
Want to come along?
Yes?
Who is it-
Why did you do that all of a sudden, Major?!
Edward Elric.
Oh no.
Your automail is broken.
Huh?
Yes. This is a serious situation.
We must get it fixed right away.
I'll escort you to Resembool.
Well, umm...
What? What?
We're going back to Resembool?
Al, listen to this...
Alphonse Elric, you stick out too much, so stay in Central.
All right! Let's make arrangements for the train ride.
Let's go, Edward Elric!
Can you cut it out already, Major?
No can do.
This is also an order.
From that man...
Yes, I understand.
Major Armstrong and Edward Elric just got on a train.
I see.
Now there are no hindrances.
I was able to come in contact with a witness who saw the guy who assaulted the prison.
And this is what he looks like.
Oh, he was alive?
I wonder if he has anything to do with the Flame Colonel?
Who knows?
But I think we can say for sure that there is a big possibility.
Where did he run off to?
Well, he's speedy, and to top it off,he's also good at hiding...
So in other words, you don't know?
You're so incompetent.
Shut up, hag.
We don't have enough people, that's why.
People?
He's all we need.
You're up, Barry the Chopper.
The whole truth lies in Xerxes.
The residents left in the city that rusted away and disappeared...
...wipe away the darkness within the boy.
Next time, Fullmetal Alchemist:
Episode 18, The Arrogant Palm of a Puny Human.
Humans, raise the signal of counterattack.So in the end, you became a soldier.
As I thought, it's far too early to teach you the art of flame alchemy.
Still, sir?
You've only taught me the basics of alchemy so far.
Of course.
Someone who would sink to becoming a dog of the military is unworthy of being taught even the basics of alchemy.
Alchemy should be used for the benefit of the masses. Isn't that correct?

Alchemy is essential for protecting the people-
I'm tired of hearing that same excuse.
I just can't sit here and watch this.
Someone as talented as you suffering crushing poverty.
Please become a State Alchemist.
If you do, you'll be able to conduct other experiments-
I've already completed my experiments long in the past.
What did you...
The most powerful alchemy.
Though depending on how it's used, it could be the most deadly.
I perfected it...
...and became satisfied.
Alchemists are creatures who must continually strive toward the truth as long as they are alive.
They die as soon as they stop the process of thinking.
I had already died long in the past-
Master!
Master!
Master Hawkeye!
Take care... of my daughter...
Every detail of my experiment... is with her...
Episode 30, Ishbal Extermination.
I'm sorry for having to rely on you for everything.
Don't worry about it.
It's my duty as a former student.
Don't hesitate to visit me at the military if anything happens.
Are you also going to judge me for becoming a soldier?
As everyone may say, there is a chance I'll end up dying like a piece of trash out on the street.
But even then, if it means I'll be able to protect this country, I don't mind at all.
Sorry if I'm boring you. It's a childish dream of mine.
No.
I think it's quite admirable.
A future where everyone will be able to live in happiness.
Can I trust you?
Can I entrust you with Father's dreams?
Hayate. No.
I'm sorry about that.
It's fine... It happens a lot.
I heard about it.
Assistant to the FÃ¼hrer President?
Yeah.
Looks like you had a rough time out there.
I didn't shoot anybody.
Didn't have to.
No... I couldn't bring myself to.
I'm worthless.
Because I'm not prepared, I end up troubling others.
Did something happen?
Scar was the one who killed Winry's parents.
I had a horrible feeling in my gut at that time.
In my mind, the gun suddenly turned into something horrifying.
And when I realized it...
I think she despised Scar enough to kill him.
I'd never seen her cry as much as she did after he left.
I'm so worthless.
I didn't understand her feelings at all.
You can only worry about something like that because you came back alive.
But you have to survive...
...for the sake of the people important to you.
You have to protect her, okay?
You love Winry, don't you?
N-No! I-I-
S-She's just a childhood friend of mine!
J-Just like family!
P-Protecting her is nothing out of the ordinary!
Umm...
Sorry.
Looks like this was a burden on you.
Have you ever thought of it as a burden?
I don't even have the right to complain about its weight anymore.
I've taken the lives of many people in the past,
and I'm also the one who chose this path.
Are you referring to Ishbal?
Do you mind if I ask you about it?
Let me hear it.
What did you wretches do in Ishbal?!
Ishbal was a rough place to live, full of rocks and sand.
So it's only fitting that a strict religion anda tenacious race of people reside there.
But some people were unhappythat they were annexed to Amestris.
And just then...
Because of one bullet, the unhappiness evolved into anger and spread throughout Ishbal.
The riot turned into a civil war and continued on for seven years.
Then, one document decided everything.
Executive Order No. 3066.
It began the Ishbal Extermination.
Just that one sheet of paper.
It was a living hell.
The air was choked with the stench of rotting corpses and gunpowder,
and the sand was soaked with blood.
An infantryman could fire at random, and if lucky, he might hit someone.
But sniping is different.
When you pull the trigger, someone dies for sure.
The two groups who were the most closely related in terms of that...
...would be snipers...
...and State Alchemists.
My name is Basque Gran, the Iron Blood Alchemist!
Iron and Blood.
In other words, Weapons and Soldiers.
Who else would be more fitting to stand at the forefront?
Damn you!
Ishbalan brats!
How... How dare you!
Roy!
Roy Mustang!
So you were here, too.
It's been a while.
But man,
your eyes look different.
Same with you.
We all have the eyes of murderers.
Yeah.
Didn't we all talk about the future of this country at the military academy?
Yeah.
A beautiful future.
Captain, a letter for you.
Thanks.
Whoa!
W-What?
My beautiful future!
Her name's Gracia!
She's waiting for my return in Central!
Alone...
What if other guys hit on her?!
No, there's no way Gracia would cheat on a handsome guy like me.
No, no, but still...
Hughes, let me warn you.
This happens a lot in both movies and novels.
The guy who talks about his lover on a battlefield...
...ends up dying right away.
Hey!
This is what keeps me alive.
This letter, and this letter only, lets me dream of tomorrow.
In this war that may never end.
You're right. There's no telling when this war will end.
No matter how many troops the country deploys, the desert just absorbs them like water.
We suffer, conquer, and what's left?
Nothing but sand.
Yeah. It's far too big of an operation for it to merely be suppression.
It's been a while, Major Mustang.
Do you remember me?
How terrible.
This woman...
...now also bears the eyes of murderers.
Please tell me, Major.
Soldiers are supposed to protect the people. Why are we killing them instead?
Alchemy is supposed to bring people happiness. Why is it being used for murder?
Because that's the State Alchemists' job.
Why are soldiers killing the people?
Because that's what we were ordered to do.
Am I wrong?
Are you telling us to look at this horrible scene rationally?!
Let's see... for example...
Girl, your face has the expression of "I'm doing this against my will".
Can you say for certain that there hasn't been a time...
...when you successfully sniped your enemy and felt good about your skill?
Miss Sniper.
That's enough!
From my point of view, it's you all who can't be understood.
A battlefield is a place for murder.
Did you put on that uniformwithout being prepared to kill?
Don't look away from death. Look forward to it.
When you kill, face them directly.
And don't forget them.
Your enemies will never forget you either.
Oh, it's time.
I need to head off to work.
I have to go, too.
Later, Roy.
Hughes.
Why do you fight?
Easy.
I don't want to die. That's it.
Reasons are always simple.
Then what is the reason behind this war?!
There...
...was a reason. A horrible reason.
You created a philosopher's stone using our blood?!
What did you do with that stone?!
It went to the hands of Major Solf J. Kimblee...
...the Crimson Alchemist...
The man with cold eyes...who has his long black hair tied back?
Yeah.
Brother...
What else?!
Th-The war situation changed with just one intention.
Ah... Such beautiful sounds.
Such wondrous sounds ringing throughout my body...
My spinal cord dances with sadness. My eardrum shivers with joy.
This feeling can only be achieved here, where we lay so close to death.
What a wonderful career!
A beautiful sound!!!
Amazing! The philosopher's stone!
It was only a matter of time before the extermination was complete.
And then, the Ishbalan priest of highest rank, Roug Roa, stood before the FÃ¼hrer President to save his people.
Oh?
So you want me to trade the lives of the tens of thousands of Ishbalans in exchange for your life?
Correct. I'm-
Don't be conceited.
Are you trying to say that your life is worth just as much as the lives of the ones who are left?
Don't get ahead of yourself, human.
A person's life is worth as much as anyone else's.
No more, no less.
I won't accept the deal.
Nor will I call off the extermination.
You monster!
God will smite you!
"God"?
How strange.
After all this, I've yet to be smote.
How many more Ishbalans must I kill for that to happen?
You bastard...
God is only a figure created by humans;that's all there is to it.
If you want to bring an iron hammer down on me,do it yourself without having to rely on God, human!
And eventually, the war ended,
and we were allowed to go home.
In the end, we soldiers are nothing but trash.
Yeah.
One human only has the power to do so much. 
That's why I'm going to protect... 
...even if it's just a handful of them... 
...the ones most important to me. 
A subordinate protects their subordinate, and so forth. 
That should be possible, even for us puny humans. 
So you decided to take this path,even after what you experienced in Ishbal?
Yes.
If this world is based on the concept ofequivalent exchange, as stated in alchemy,
then we must carry corpses and cross the river of blood in exchange for the new generation to live in happiness.
I'm appointing you as my assistant.
I want you to protect my back.
Do you understand?
If I'm leaving you in charge of defending my back,it means you can shoot me from behind at any time.
If I ever stray from my path,shoot me right away with those hands.
You have that right.
Will you follow me?
Understood.
If you wish, I will follow you to the depths of Hell.
But even if the Colonel becomes the FÃ¼hrer, it wouldn't change the militaristic element of this country!
You're right.
Congress pretty much exists as the army's puppet right now.
Someone would need to change that and turn this country into a democracy.
For this country to be reborn, all the faults that existed from the militaristic regime will have to be brushed away.
Faults?

That's right.
The heroes during the troubled times are nothing but mass murderers during times of peace.
So the Colonel is reaching for the top while knowing about all this?
He's only on a path of self-destruction!
The homunculi are the ones who were pulling the strings.
Even if the homunculi were the ones who triggered it,we're the ones who committed the atrocities.
We mustn't turn away from death.
We mustn't forget the ones we killed.
Because...
...they'll never forget us, the ones who killed them.
But...
Don't you have something to do before you start worrying about us?
Both you and Alphonse need to return to your bodies.
I'm sure a lot of people are waiting for the day you reach your goal.
Yeah.
I'll definitely get my body back. Together with Al.
Thanks for letting us stay, Dr. Nox.
Umm... Mister Armor?
Really, thank you for everything.
I have a name, you know. It's Alphonse Elric.
Elric?
You remember Edward Elric, right?
That small alchemist.
I'm his younger brother.
I lost my body due to certain circumstances, though...









If you're that guy's younger brother...
...does this mean you look just like him?
How rude!
I'm much taller than him!
My face isn't that stern, and I'm much stronger than him!
But I'm not short-tempered, either.
I'm a gentleman!
Sir Alphonse!!
I hope you get your body back soon!
Yeah. I hope so, too.
Dr. Marcoh, I've brought your meal.
Huh? It's awfully quiet in here.
Could it be you're crying again, reminiscing about Ishbal?
The White Devil has been released into the wild.
The new fight begins now.
But the boy will not flinch.
He gets up and walks again, with hope as his landmark.
Next time, Fullmetal Alchemist:
Episode 31, The Promise Made For 520 Cenz.
The world which can only be understood by the ones who fought together is right in front of us.blue scene
~ENG~
Dear!
Stay back!
Hey...
I think you owe me an explanation, Wrath...!
My past memories won't disappear...
They're making so much noise inside my head!!
Why are you...
Why is King Bradley inside of my memories?!
You!!
What did you do to my belongings?!
This is your greed, huh...
You're a fool who craves even his past,without knowing how to let anything go!
Damn you!
Master!
Madam, Sir Selim, are you two all right as well?!
Y-Yes...
We're terribly sorry.
The guards didn't even stand a chance against him...
No, worry not.
He was quite powerful.
Yes, sir...
Father,
hurry up and retire.
Olivier...
You come home after such a long time,and that's the first thing you have to say?
I'm asking you to spend the remainder of your life in peace after naming me the head of the family.
I plan to have Alex succeed the house.
A coward like him?
Why not transfer all of the family property and go on a long vacation to a foreign country or something?
Alex would be nothing but a hindrance to the Armstrong name.
Sister!
So you were home.
Great timing, Alex.
Father?
Duel with Olivier.
Pardon?
The victor shall inherit the house.
How does that sound, Olivier?
Perfect.
A plausible solution.
Olivier told me to retire and to leave the country.
What?!
What an insult to our father!
Very well!
I shall show you what my muscles are capable of.
Quite brave of you, Alex!
You'll soon see how inexperienced you truly are!
Well then, shall we get going?
Yes.
So, where should we go for vacation?
How about Xing, Dear?
I hear the food is wonderful there.
Very well, Xing it is.
Are you okay with that, Catherine?
Yes, Father.
W-Wait...
You wish.
Are you planning on killing me...?
It took you 
Good luck, Brother!
What should we get for them as souvenirs?
What about an elephant?
They're big and strong.
Wow, I'd like one too!
No!!!
It would appear the outcome has been decided.
I'm going to inherit everythingowned by the Armstrong family.
Sister...
I hear you've been quite familiar with the upper echelon lately.
Why?!
Do you not know what they're-
I plan to see things with my own eyes before making a decision.
So after you saw their true intentions,
you had the family flee the country in order to keep them safe?
The defeated should disappear.
This mansion belongs to me now.
Where are you headed, little girl?
This is the easternmost town.
Even if you keep going, you'll only find a desert.
Umm... I was planning on going back to my country.
Your country?
Yes. To Xing.
You're going to cross the desert?
Yes.
A little girl like you is going to cross the desert by herself?
Yes.
Hey guys!
Let's get something together!
Bring out some food and the like!
Huh? But...!
Don't be so restrained!
Why not stay here for the nightand leave for your trip tomorrow?
You can use our bath.
Are you hungry?
Oh yeah, Steve, you've got an extra room at your place, right?
Why don't you let her stay there?
Sure, fine with me.
My eldest daughter's room is open right now.
Emmy, who left for the university in Central, right?
She's too perfect to be your daughter.
Can't argue with that.
We also need to feed this little kitty something.
Oh, my! You must be really hungry!
Are you sure it's not just looking at 
Don't be stupid!
That's not true, right, Kitty?
See? It's saying that you look tasty!
Nice people, aren't they?
Are you just going to abandon them?
Well, I guess that's fine.
But I don't think you'll gain anything frombringing back a half-dead homunculus like me.
However, if you go to Central, you'll be able to learn the true method to gain immortality.
You may be able to save these people as well.
Oh well.
I guess it doesn't mean much to you,since you're on your way back to your country.
Thank you so much for your kindness, everyone!
Where are you going?!
I still have something I need to take care of!
I'm going back to Central!




What is this place?
It's a hideout we've used before.
So this is where your little brother is?
Yeah.
One hundred percent positive.
Al will definitely be here!
Hey!
There's no one here!
Ow!
You're such an unreliable brother!
So we came all the way down here for nothing?
Ling.
No... is it Greed?
I'm... starving...
Okay, it's Ling.
Much better!
Thanks for the meal!
You always eat so much, doofus!
So much for our emergency provisions.
Who are those two? Your friends?
Meet Donkey Kong and Li-
My name's Darius!
I'm Heinkel.
We used to be in the army, but we're working with this brat right now for various reasons.
Who the hell is he?
Well... how should I explain it...
I'm a homunculus.
Homun-
Hey, hey! Why can't you keep your mouth shut?!
Seriously?!
It's a long story, but...
Hang on, what the hell are you doing here, anyway?
Greed cut all ties with the other homunculi.
I took advantage of his restlessness at that point to get my body back from him.
I was looking for a place near Central where I could rest,
and I found this shed...
What's wrong?!
This isn't good!
Greed's trying to take over!
Hey!
Hey! Hey! Wait just a second!
Hold out! Don't lose!
Keep your senses!
Listen up, Ed!
That 'Father' guy who lurks beneath Central is going to open the gate on "The Day".
I can only speculate since I'm an amateur at this sort of thing,
but wouldn't you and Al be able to get your bodies back if you two leap into that gate?
No, wait.
That may be true,
but you need to pay a toll to open the gate...

Since you said "The Day", does he already know when he's going to open it?
That's...
Ling!
Hey!
Dammit...
Don't take over just yet...!
The message...
Did you deliver my message... to Lan Fan?
"Message"?
Al delivered it to her.
Lan Fan is fine.
I don't know where she is now, though.
Wow, I'm glad to hear...
Ling!
Sorry...
Can't hold out any... longer.
Damn that prince!
Blabbering on and on...!
Is that you, Greed?
Yeah, it's me.
I wouldn't do that if I were you.
You can't kill me with that.
Sorry to disturb you guys.
Hey!
Are you just going to let us go?!
What?
Weren't you listening to what this guy was saying?
I cut ties with the homunculi.
I lost it and attacked Bradley.
I don't know 
That's why I'm just going to run offlike this and live an easy life.
Alone.
Want to join us?
If you've got nowhere else to go, then come with us.
Join you...
Join you, eh?
That's funny.
Cut the shit!
This entire world belongs to me!
If 
Later.
Comrades, huh...
I've got so many souls inside of me...
And yet, I'm... alone.
Then why don't you join up with Ed and them?
If you don't like that, then give me back my body.
I'll become the Emperor of Xing and fill up the emptiness in your soul.
An emperor of a country, eh...
Big dream, huh?
You brat!
That's way too small.
If you're going to go that way...
Why don't you strive to become the King of the world?
King of the world...
Hey, Ling!
Wait up!
What? You guys are so persistent!
I told you, I'm Greed!
I don't even care which one you are anymore!
Just to make it easier, I'll call you Gredlin!
Hey! Who are you calling Gredl-
I'll work under you, Gredlin.
What?
I told you, I'll work for you.
Which means these two chimeras working with me will be working for you as well.
What?!
You brat!
Who gave you permission, anyway?!
Don't get so cocky, you runt!
Midget! Flea!
Besides, the moment I decided to become a dog of the military, I threw away all my pride.
At this point, I don't really care if I have to wag my tail.
And besides,
it would be dumb to lose this opportunity to get information by having my pride take over.
The chance of a lifetime!
How foolish.
You're going to let your strong feelings take over like that and lose important information?
Interesting!
Becoming one of my men also means becoming an outcast!
You better not regret it!
Don't take me lightly!
I've done far worse than this!
What the hell?
Then it's decided.
Then you two are my men as well.
Yeah, sure, whatever.
I don't care who I follow as long as I get to eat.
Just out of curiosity, what kind of chimeras are you?
I'm a gorilla.
Lion here.
That's pretty sweet.
I still have her earrings...
Looks like I won't be seeing Winry and Al for a while...
"The Day"... huh.
Seriously, stop coming here all the time!

I even said I'd let you know when Miss Izumi returns!
If you keep visiting like this, we'll go out of business!
Curtis butcher shop, how can I help you?
Oh, we're always glad to have your business, sir!
The one you ordered, right?
We'll be back.
Come back as a customer for once, will ya?!
I'm sorry, the soldiers were here again.
Yes.
I have a message for you from Alphonse and a man named Hohenheim.

I see.
That sounds like a pretty big deal.
Yeah.
Got it.
The promised day, huh...

Hurry and contact headquarters!
This is Point Papa!
We're under attack!
What?! Drachman forces?!
I don't know!
How many men?!
Just one!
One?! Who are they?!
Hey! I'm asking who they are!
Point Papa!
Who is the enemy?!
A housewife!


This is just like what happened around twenty years ago.
They were all beat down by one force?
They're really going to get killed by the Major General when she returns.
Major Miles!

Good work.
An Ishbalan with dark glasses,
and a large man with a mohawk.
Just like I heard.
I was waiting for you two to come out.
Who the hell are you?
Like I said, I'm a passing housewife.
I have a message for you from Al.
Can we speak in private?
Yes, it's a message from Alphonse Elric.

All that was contained in the message is "The Promised Day".

Well, well, the promised day.
Very fitting.
Things are really starting to get interesting.

Hey, Rebecca!
Your skills are as good as ever!
And...
Your butt is as sexy as ever!
What are you doing, Lieutenant General Grumman?!
You shouldn't let your guard down on the battlefield.
By the way, you're friends with Lieutenant Hawkeye, right?

Hey, Riza!
It's been so long, Rebecca!
They rescheduled the joint training between the north and the east.
You know, because of that battle between Drachma and Briggs from the other day.
Now it's planned to take place in the east, right?
I heard from the FÃ¼hrer President.
First, Colonel Mustang, now, the FÃ¼hrer President...
Introduce me to some hot guys in Central, why don't you?
Here's one.
Hayate!
Your master is heartless! She's stingy!
You just watch!
I'm going to marry some rich guy and retire already!
Okay! Good luck!
Oh.
Give my regards to Second Lieutenant Havoc.
Sure.
See you later!
"Give my regards to Second Lieutenant Havoc", huh?
I'm thinking about transferring to a hospital in the east once my body settles down.
Is that so?
It'll get lonely around here.
If I had known that, I would have brought you something better.
This is for you.
One cigarette a day, right?
Thanks a bunch!
I just ran out of them.
Well, I'll visit you again.
Thanks!
Oh, right.
Rebecca was worried about you.
Okie dokie!
If the Colonel visits, please give him my regards.
Sure thing!
Did you hear that, Colonel?
You didn't need to hide like that.
Well, we're both being watched.
It'll be bad if they get suspicious of us after meeting in private.
Delicious...
How about a smoke, Colonel?
No, I'll pass.
Come on, just one for the road.
"In the following Spring,
on the promised day,
both the north and the east will make their move."






























Episode 45, The Promised Day.
In the Spring of next year, the people harden their resolve.
The boy heads for the enemy's lair with determination in his heart.
Next time, Fullmetal Alchemist:
Episode 46, The Creeping Shadow.
Even if they're far apart, their hearts are linked.
As long as they're both on the move.
















Maes Hughes is dead.
He was murdered by mysterious people who have tattoos of Ouroboros.

decided to make his way to Central.

Episode 11, The Miracle at Rush Valley.
However...
Rush Valley!
Automail!
Automail~
Automail!
I'm so blessed!
It's a Gotts eleventh year model!
I never thought I'd be able to lay my eyes on one!
As expected from the Holy Land of Automails.
This place is packed.
Where's the fun in staring at automails all day in this hot weather?
We should have just left Winryand headed straight for Dublith!
Hey you, do you have a moment?
This automail's a rare make.
You're right. Take a look, everyone.
Hey.
Hey, whoa-
Cut it out! C-Cut it-
I said cut it out! N-Not there!
No! N-No!!!
Everyone's so eager to learn!
Get off me!
Geez... This is why I can't stand automail mechanics...
U-Umm...
Huh?
What's wrong?
I can't find it...
Find what?
The sign of a State Alchemist...
...my silver pocket watch!
I can't find it.
That's probably Paninya's doing.
Paninya?
She's a pickpocket who goes after tourists.
Any idea where she is?
It's something really important!
I don't mind telling ya...
...But in exchange...
Let me see your automail one last...
She's at an automail mechanic by the name of Dominic's place!
They said he lives deep in the mountains because you can find high quality ore, but...
This really is the right path... right?
They didn't trick us, did they?
It's your fault for saying you wanted to go to that city in the first place!
Getting your silver pocket watch stolen was due to your own carelessness!
Shut up!
Hey, you two!
What do you want?!
Isn't that the girl?
Found her!!!
Give it back...
You're amazing! What the heck are you?
I'm... an alchemist!
Wow, awesome!
Moving about so much...
Hey, you're running out of breath!
I've been waiting for you.
Well done!
What do you say you give it back now...
...my silver pocket watch...
It's not really a rare sight, is it?Considering the city you were just at.
And also...
A 1.5 inch culverin in my left leg.
Wait!
Catch me if you can!
Don't even try to escape!
Good work, Winry! Don't let go of her!
That's the plan!
I won't let go of you until you let me examine your automail!
Oh my, Paninya.
You brought friends over?
Well, about that...
Give up already!
It's my first time seeing an automail like this!
The suspension is powerful, but what's even more amazing is the overall balance!
This efficient design is a work of art!
Umm... about my silver pocket watch...
It's no use, Brother...
This is amazing! How did they do this?
You have my deepest respect for being able to make such an automail!
No, I'm not the one who made it.
It's mine.
Isn't it a bit heavy?
Yeah... I agree.
It's not good to put a strain on the recipient.
Maybe that's why this guy's so small?
Don't call me small!
Which means I'd get bigger if it's made lighter.
There's a possibility.
You're huge, Brother!
You're so tall!
You guys are so puny.
I've decided.
Mister Dominic!
Hmm?
Please make me your apprentice!
No can do.
You could at least give it a little more thought...
Shut up. I don't take apprentices.
I'm begging you!
Could you please teach her how to build an automail that would help me grow?
Shut up, flea.
Sorry about that.
My old man's pretty stubborn.
Yeah...
Flea... Flea...
Flea...
Hm?
That's... a baby, right?
That's right.
Can I feel your belly?
Sure, go ahead.
It's kind of mysterious.
Yeah.
It's weird to think we were inour mom's womb like this once, too...
Are you all right?!
Y-Yeah...
The junctions start to ache when the weather is no good.
Why do you wear an automail?
I lost both my parents and my legs in a train accident.
It really felt like the end of the world for me,
since I had no relatives, nor was I able to walk at all.
And that's when I met Mister Dominic.
You've got a look saying,"I'm the most miserable person in the world".
Ones like you piss me off the most!
Let me go! Let me go!
Eyes of a corpse.
I probably looked dreadful back then...
And so, while I had no idea what was going on, he stuck these on me.
The surgery was painful, and the rehab was backbreaking; everything was horrible.
But...
When I was able to stand on my feet again,I felt like the world was mine.
I'm really thankful to Mister Dominic.
I plan on repaying the debt,even if it takes my whole life to do it.
Even though I've never gotten him to accept any kind of payment...
So that's why you pickpocket...
If you're truly thankful, then stop pickpocketing!
Huh?
Mister Dominic gave you these legs in good faith.
So you have to respond to that with the same, too!
If you're really planning on spending your whole life trying to repay him, stand up and work hard to earn money!
With those legs he gave you!
I'm sure that would make Mister Dominic much happier.
I see...
You're right!
Yeah! I'll stop pickpocketing!
I'll repay him by earning money honestly!
Oh, that's right...
I have to give this back to him.
Right!
Huh?
Uh-oh... Did I break it?
It won't open...
Let me see.
No, he's sealed it with alchemy.
How come?
The answer is obvious.
Because there's something embarrassing in here he doesn't want anyone else to see!
Got it!
Now, let's see what Ed's got in here...
"Don't forget. 3. Oct. 11."
What is this?
Please give this back to Ed.
Winry?
I'm...
I'm going to try asking Mister Dominic for an apprenticeship again!
What's wrong?
B-Being bo...
Bingo?
Being bo... Bo...
What about bingo?
B...
B-
Miss Sadila says the baby's being born!!!
We can't take her to a hospital in the city in this weather.
I'll rush over there and bring back a doctor.
My old man will be back with a doctor soon.
Just hang in there, okay?
I can't exactly "hang in there"if the baby's trying to come out...
What's wrong?!
What's she saying? I can't make it out.
The baby's being born!
B... B... Being born?!
What are we going to do?! There's no doctor around!
What are we going to do?! What are we going to do?!
Hey, you! What are we going to do?!
We have to do it!
Do what?
The delivery.
What?!
D-Do you have experience delivering a baby?
I don't. But...
We don't have time to sit around, either!
We need to work together to help the baby be born!
Ed and Al, you two go boil some water!
Got it!
Paninya, collect all the towels you can find!
Roger!
And Mr. Riddle, do you have any rubbing alcohol?
I think we have some in the storehouse!
Oh, and please prepare some water for Miss Sadila to drink!
Say... Do you think she can handle this?
She was born into a family of doctors,
so she basically grew up reading medical books.
Yup.
What?! Then that means she didn't actually study how to...
I'm sure she only remembers those things vaguely.
No way...
But right now,
we need to put faith in her knowledge and courage.
First, boil water, then sterilization...
What else is there to do?
Try to remember... Try to remember...
Winry.
You can do it!
Yeah.
Paninya, help me out in here.
O-Okay.
Brother...
I'm always powerless in critical moments...
Oww! Oww! Oww! Oww!!!
I'm going to die!
It hurts so much!
I can't take it anymore!!!
I don't believe in God, but...
Yeah.
If you exist, then please... just for now...
Brother!
H-Hey!
B-Blood...
I can't... take it...
What happened? Hey!
She did it!
Hooray!
That's awesome! The baby was really born!
That's so awesome! Awesome, I tell you!
You sound like a little kid saying that.
Think about it! It's the birth of a life!
It's what alchemists have been spending hundreds of years trying to do.
A human creating a human.
Don't group alchemy with the mysteries of life.
I can't help it; I'm an alchemist.
But still, that's awesome.
Humans are awesome.
Well, since the baby was safely born,
is there anything I can help out with?
Good question.
For starters, help me up...
Huh?
It's humiliating to be carried by a guy shorter than me.
Don't make me drop you.
Ed...
Hm?
I saw what you wrote inside your silver pocket watch...
Oww...
Did you force it open?
Sorry...
Idiot.
I haven't even shown it to Al.
But why?
A lesson for myself and to show my determination.
It's kind of girly of me.
That I have to hold on to that day in a shape like this...
Why are 
There's no going back now...
Yeah.
Why are 
I'm crying 
Idiot.
Hey... I think you should go back to Resembool.
Granny's probably lonely being all by herself.
No, I'm not going back.
Hey...
After seeing your determination...
I can't be walking around withhalf-assed determination, either.
No, it's not like you have to carry the burden either...
I want to keep getting better,
so I can equip you with better automail.
So you can continue your journey with peace of mind.
So I'm going to try asking Mister Dominic for an apprenticeship again!
I see...
Good luck.
Thanks.
Winry, Mister Riddle wants to see you.
Huh? What's the matter?
No, it's nothing. I'll be right there.
Paninya...
Oww! What was that for?!
Shut up! Give me my watch back, you thief!
You didn't have to hit me with your right hand!
Then I'll hit you again with my left!
It's your grandpa!
So cute!
His personality's changed...
Both you and your baby are in excellent condition.
The post-birth care was also very well done.
Even an adult would panic if they happened to witness childbirth for the first time.
Oh! Well... I panicked a little.
I owe all of you a huge thank you.
Especially you, young lady.
Thank you so much.
Please don't be so formal!
Oh, geez... I'm embarrassed.
How about it? Taking an apprentice here might be a...
This and that are two different things.
I won't take any apprentices.
But, if you insist...
I'll introduce you to a skilled technician that lives at the foot of the mountain.
U-Umm...
Can I visit to observe your work from time to time?
You can come visit to see my grandchild, sure.
You, too, Paninya!
Oh no! Hurry!
If we miss it, we're going to have to waitanother three days for the next train to Dublith!
Take care of yourselves, now!
You, too!
Be sure you give Granny a call!
I don't want to hear that from 
Make sure you steal that geezer's techniques,
so you can equip me with abetter automail the next time you see me!
And there he goes.
You can count on me.
The boys reminisce of the times they were in training...
...when they visit Dublith, the city where their master lives.
That becomes their first step toward the truth.
Next time, Fullmetal Alchemist:
Episode 12, One is All, All is One.
He hesitates to speak,
because he wants to protect them.
In the city of Liore, a High Priest of Leto deceived people through the use of the philosopher's stone and alchemy.
Ed and Al, who ventured into the church, stopped the High Priest's plot.
However, the philosopher's stone was a fake.
"Get up and take a step. Walk forward."
Ed's words pierced Rose's chest, who had lost all hope.
But, those words were also meant for themselves, as well.
Episode 4, An Alchemist's Distress.
You're Basque Gran, the Iron Blood Alchemist, aren't you?
Who are you?
Alchemists who go against God's path...
...shall perish!
So 
But!
You picked... the wrong opponent!
You're fast! But...
Well, then...
How foolish.
W-What?!
Perish.
Another State Alchemist?
Looks like quite a mess.
You have to be careful, too, Major.
You may be his next target.
Yes, sir...
FÃ¼hrer President!
Why are you here, sir?
I heard the news.
Lt. Colonel Hughes, are you in charge of dealing with this matter?
Yes, sir!
If there are people whom you require assistance from, request them immediately.
We must bring the iron hammer down on the traitors.
Yes, sir!
Second Lieutenant Breda.
All right...
Seriously... The Colonel must have been procrastinating again.
Hey, Havoc, do half of these for me.
I've got my hands full over here, too.
Umm, who is this again?
That's Lieutenant Yoki.
He's a little rascal who was lining his pockets with the authority he was given at the coal mines of Youswell.
He's currently on the run after havinghis actions exposed by the Elric Brothers.
Sergeant Fuery, how is the radio?
The receiver is broken.
We'll need to replace some parts...
Edward-kun! Alphonse-kun!
Welcome back, you two.
The Colonel has been waiting for you.
The matter in Liore is settled all thanks to you.
I'd like to express my gratitude.
It wasn't for you or anything.
And, was the search forthe philosopher's stone a failure again?
The stone was a fake.
But the power was unbelievable.
He transmuted a huge chimera, too.
I wonder how you could use the stone to make something like that?
I'm not really familiar with the field ofBiological Alchemy, so I wouldn't know, but...
Yeah, I'm a little curious.
If we put our effort into researching it,we may find something useful in getting our bodies back.
Yeah.
Then, how about seeking help from a specialist?
Huh?
The Sewing-Life Alchemist, Shou Tucker.
He is a scholar in chimera transmutation.
I'll introduce you to him.

I-It's a trap! There's definitely more than meets the eye!
Don't look at me with those suspicious eyes!
We're even after that case in Liore!
It just feels disgusting to know that I owe you.
Tucker became a State Alchemist two years ago after transmuting a chimera that understood human language.
"Understood human language"?
It could speak?! The chimera?!
Yeah. Apparently, it did.
Just one sentence...
"I want to die."
It never ate afterwards and died.
What a huge house.
B-Brother!
Wow, we've got a lot of visitors!
Nina, we have to keep the dog tied down.
I'm terribly sorry.
This house has been in a mess ever since my wife left.
Well, pleasure to meet you, Edward.
I'm Shou Tucker, the Sewing-Life Alchemist.
He is interested in the transmutation of living organisms.
He said he would love to havethe honor of seeing your work.
Sure, that's fine with me.
One thing, though...
If you'd like for me to show you my hand,
I'm going to need to see yours, too.
Isn't that what being an alchemist is about?
Why are you interested in the transmutation of the living organisms, exactly?
Oh, well... he's...
Colonel.
Transmutation of your mother?!
As an eleven year old child?!
Ah, I see. So that's why you're called "The Fullmetal Alchemist"...
You've experienced a tough past, haven't you...
I'm not sure whether I could be of any help at all,
but please take a look at my laboratory.
Wow...
Ah, this is a little embarrassing.
People call me the "authority" on chimeras, but in reality, it's not really going very well.
Wow, this is awesome!
That's the reference room. Feel free to take a look around.
All right. Then I'll start with this shelf.
Then I'll start with that one over there.
I'll be returning to work.
I'll send someone to pick them up in the evening.
Wow, he's really into it.
He can't even hear what's going on around him.
I guess geniuses really do exist.
Up high! Up high!
Al, what the heck are you doing?!
Nina seemed like she wanted someone to play with her.
Hey, what the heck do you think we're here for-
Alexander wants someone to play with, too, he says.
You've got some guts.
It's said that even when hunting rabbits, lions put forth their fullest effort.
I, Edward Elric, shall deal with you with all of my physical and spiritual might!!!
You damn dog!!!
Yo Boss, I've come to pick you up.
What are you doing?
Eh, just taking a break from research...
Did you manage to get good data?
You're welcome to visit tomorrow, too.
You'll come visit again?
Let's play tomorrow, all right, Nina?
Okay!
Oh right, Mr. Tucker, I've got a message for you from the Colonel.
He told me to tell you, "It's almost the day of the assessment. Don't forget."
Yes, understood.
Well, then.
Daddy.
What's an "assessment"?
Well...
A State Alchemist has to report the results of his experiments once a year.
Daddy couldn't get a good evaluation last year.
If Daddy messes up this year,Daddy won't be a State Alchemist anymore.
What?!
You'll be fine, Daddy!
You're always studying so much!
You're right. I've got to do my best.
This... is my last chance...
Huh, your mother left home two years ago?
Daddy told me that she went back to her parents' home.
Oh... it must be kind of lonely for you,being alone with your daddy in a big house like this.
Nope, I'm fine.
Daddy's really nice, and I've got Alexander with me, too.
But... Daddy's always at his lab these days, so..
I guess I'm kind of lonely...
Ugh, my shoulders have gotten a little stiff.
Why don't you exercise a bit, Brother?
That sounds kind of nice.
Hey, dog!
Accompany me on my exercises!
You, too, Nina.
Wait up!
Watch this!
Hey, hey, hey!
Wait, you!
Wait!
You can do it, Alexander!
"It's almost the day of the assessment. Don't forget."
But... why does he only target State Alchemists?
If the army is his target, he can just attack soldiers indiscriminately.
Since alchemists possess special abilities, they're not easy to kill.
And one with a state qualification should be much tougher.
Perhaps it's the qualification that's the reason?
Hm?
An immense reward and various privileges.
Many are envious of them.
Also...
"Alchemists, work for the good of the public."
Alchemists, who are supposed to be searching for the truth,
turn into the army's human weaponsas soon as they earn their state qualifications.
And also, after that civil war in Ishbal,
there are many who hold a grudge against us.
Reporting.

Station?!
Did he run away?!
Our lives before I got my state qualification were terrible.
We were so poor.
My wife couldn't stand living in conditions like that, and she left our home.
I need to pass the assessment, no matter what...
I don't ever want to return to those days.
It's okay, Daddy!
If they tell you "No", Alexander and I will go and scold the higher-ups!
Nina sure is strong.
Nina... what do you say we play together tomorrow?
Really?!
Yeah.
Yay!
Alexander, Daddy said he'd play with us tomorrow!
Good morning, Mr. Tucker!
We're going to be using your place again today!
Huh?
Mr. Tucker?
Hey! Nina?
Mr. Tucker?
Oh, so you 
Hey...
It's complete. The finished product.
A chimera that understands human language.
Watch.
This person is Edward. Got it?
Ed...ward...
That's right! I'm so proud of you!
This is amazing... it really did talk.
Now I won't have to lose my state qualification.
Ed...ward...
Ed...ward...
Ed...ward...
O...nii...chan...
Mr. Tucker...
When did you get your state qualification again?
It was two years ago, I believe.
And when did your wife leave you?
Two years ago.
Can I ask you another question?
Nina and Alexander...
Where are they?!
I don't like sharp brats like you.
Brother!
Yeah, that's how it is!
You've done it, haven't you?!
It was your wife two years ago,
and this time, you used your daughter and your dog to transmute a chimera!
Since there are limits to animal experimentation, after all!
It must be a breeze if you use a human!!!
W-What's there to get angry about?
The mankind's advances are the product of many experiments on humans, aren't they?
If you're a scientist, too, then you should-
Don't screw around with me!!!
Do you really think something like this will be forgiven?!
Something like this... toying with human life?!
Human life?
Ah, human life, you say?
Fullmetal Alchemist!
Your limbs and your younger brother.
Aren't those the results of what you're saying right now? Toying with human life?
NO!!!
We're the same!
You and I!
No, we're not!!!
Yes, we are!
There was a possibility in front of us, so we tested it out.
Even though we knew it was taboo!
You're wrong!!!
I!
Alchemists!
Don't!
I... I!!!
Brother!
If you go any further, he'll die!
Da...ddy...
Does it hurt?
Da...ddy...
Does it hurt?
I'm sorry.
We can't change you back to normal with our powers.
I'm sorry... I'm sorry...
Let's... play.
Let's play...
I made it in time.
With this, I can continue being a State Alchemist...
State Alchemist, my ass...
Stop kidding yourself...
Let's... play.
DAMMIT!!!
If something such as an act of the Devil exists in this world,
this case is just that.
The Devil, huh...
But if it is an order, State Alchemists must maketheir move, without hesitation, to take human lives.
If it's about handling human lives,
there really isn't much difference between where we stand and what Mr. Tucker did.
You were aware of that, and yet you chose this path.
Am I right, Fullmetal?
I'm sure you'll run into incidents like this in the future again.
There may be times when you have to soil your hands.
Are you going to come to a stop like that every time it happens?
Whether they call me a dog of the military, or curse me as a devil,
Al and I will get back our bodies.
But...
We're neither devils,
nor gods at that!
We're humans...
We're just humans!!!
Puny, powerless humans...
...who can't even save one little girl.
I wonder why no one understands us...
...Nina...
You're Shou Tucker, aren't you?
Who are you?
Looks like... you're not from the military!
How did you get in?!
There should have been military policemen stationed out front!
Alchemists, who go against God's path...
...shall perish!
Da...ddy...
Da...ddy...
Daddy...
How miserable...
But now that you are in a state like that,there is no way to return you to normal.
At the very least, leave this world in peace.
God,
two souls have just returned to your side.
Please usher them into your broad bosom,and grant rest and salvation to their miserable souls.
While rain is pouring in East City,
still grief-stricken over Nina's death,
Ed and Al are attacked by the mysterious man, Scar.
In this crisis, Ed makes a critical decision.
Next time, Fullmetal Alchemist:
Episode 5, Rain of Sorrow.
Can anyone criticize decisions made in despair?
Episode 48, A Vow Made Underground.
Geez, I've died...
...so many times because of you!
That was close!
Young master!
Save the reunion for later!
Let's finish this up!
Roger!
Just let me eat you already!
What a one-sided battle!
I had no idea you were hiding such a fine woman from me.
Quite the playboy, are we?
Thank you kindly!
How in the world can you tell where I am...
...when it's so pitch dark out here?
The Emperor of Xing moves our nation by manipulating the veins of the dragon,
in other words, the flow of energy.
We, who serve him, can also read the flow.
Additionally, by virtue of our office, we can see well in the dark.
That voice...
It's been a while, kid.
So it 
Why are you here?
How did you know where we were?
We were lurking in Central for a bit to figure out what was going on,
and we sensed a few substantial energy forms headed in this direction.
So we followed them.
There are two large energy forms clashing right over there, too.
I think those are Greed and Gluttony.
Greed...!
The one who took over the young master's body?!
There's also one in the woods.
A friend of ours is fighting a homunculus named Pride right now.
Right.
And lastly,
there's something within the nearby village that can't even be compared to the rest.
That's probably Ed's old man.
Him?!
Is your father not human?!
We can leave him be for now.
Gotta do something about the homunculi first.
Don't worry about Gluttony.
We can leave him to Lan Fan.
"Leave him to Lan Fan"...?
It's only been half a year since she got her automail attached!
That's reckless, old man!
We need to help her, or she's dead meat!
What the hell?!
Don't worry about her.
Martial arts isn't our only weapon.
If you're gonna blow stuff up, say so first!
What?!
Explosions?!
What's going on?
Is it in the forest?
Are lights not back on yet?
Hey, bring a lamp!
Geez...
In that case, I guess I can rest assured.
Old Man Fu, what else do you guys have aside from explosives?
A lot of stuff.
Tear gas, flash bangs, and flares.
The people in the slums are beginning to turn on lights.
Those shadows will start to appear again.
If we don't hurry, Heinkel will be in trouble!
Exactly.
Old Man Fu, could you take me to where Pride is?
There's something I want you to help out with.
Roger that.
Ed!
Don't let your guard down.
Pride, the one that Heinkel's fighting...
Just die already...
It's just as you said, little Roy.
Selim Bradley is not human.
These photographs are quite old.
Twenty years ago...
And this one's from fifty years ago.
No matter what era, he's always near important government officials.
I also checked the town where the FÃ¼hrer President was supposedly born in.
Although there are documents that show he grew up there,
not a single soul has seen the Bradley family there before.
The mansion located at the address was also a fake.
Of course, no relatives either.
Thank you, Madam Christmas.
You must have been through a lot to gather all this information.
You bet.
But the moment I found out Selim wasn't human,
all my fatigue just flew away.
But then...
...I wonder why nobody noticed before?
He's the son of the man who stands at the top of this militaristic nation, even nicknamed 'King'.
Fabricating a tale is like a walk in the park.
Y-You little...!
Hey!
Who is it?!
Is someone there?!
A monster!
Oh no!
A child is being attacked!
A monster!!
Shit!
Naturally, with this much light, there's plenty of shadow.
Goodbye, mister chimera.
That was close, man.
Geez...
I still can't believe a brat like you was a homunculus.
You certainly had me going, Selim Bradley.
Appearances are only symbols.
Isn't that right,
mister tiny alchemist?
Where is he?!
Where's Roy Mustang?!
He's still inside.
Been in there for a while,considering how he goes there so often.
That woman, Madam Christmas...
Her real name is Chris Mustang.
His foster mother!
Dammit!
Christ...
Look what happened to my castle...
I'll buy another one for you soon, so forgive me.
In that case, I guess I can let it go.
I'm going to need to stay undercover for a while, too.
Are the girls from the shop safe?
Don't worry, they should be in a foreign country by now.
They're probably having fun,and I'm sure they've forgotten about you.
Moving right along...
Worry about yourself and this country's future for now.
I won't forgive you if I meet you in a body bag as a traitor the next time I see you.
Thanks, Madam.
I'll definitely repay you.
Gonna repay the loan once you become successful, eh?
I guess I'll be looking forward to it this time, little Roy.
I'm not a kid anymore, you know...
Okay.
Guess it's time for me to do my job too.
You're late, Colonel.
We were about to leave without you.
Your jabs make me feel right at home.
No signs of being followed?
Nope.
If there were, he'd react to them right away.
That's a good boy.
I'm counting on you!
Any movements from the Bradley family?
I've confirmed their plans for the next three days.
The FÃ¼hrer President is attending the joint practice in the east.
Selim is also with him.
About that...
The train that was carrying the FÃ¼hrer President plummeted down a valley.
Wow...
That old Grumman really knows how to be extreme.
With that, they'll start being a lot more cautious...
That may make some things difficult for us.
Will that affect our mission?
Will the Eastern Army come to Central as planned?
The FÃ¼hrer President is missing...
The chance of a lifetime, or a trap to lure us in...
Even if it happens to be the latter, we have no choice but to proceed.
Please give us an order.
What's in our hands right now is a one-way ticket to a battlefield.
No matter the outcome, we can't go back.
The reason for that is because even after we complete our mission,
you all have the grand task of rebuilding the nation by my side, after I become FÃ¼hrer President.
With that said, my only order for you all is this:
"Don't die!"
That is all!
Roger!
Why...
Why won't it slice?
Good thing I left my automail in its northern state.
There's plenty of carbon fiber in it, after all.
Carbon reinforcement!
Copying Greed, eh?
In that case...
What's wrong?
Are you finished already?!
As originally planned...
Al!
...it's probably advantageous for me to fight using your little brother.
Old Man Fu!
A flash bang?!
Curses!
I'm sick of those guys!
Huh?
What's wrong, Lan Fan?!
Lan Fan!
Donkey Kong!
You got it!
Al!
Donkey Kong, you take Al and run.
Isn't he still under Pride's influence?
Parts that have been separated froma homunculi's body disperse and cease to exist.
Since we separated Al from the sourceof the shadow, Pride is no longer inside him.
I won't let you get away!
Have another one!
Hey, what was that flash from earlier?
Ow! Ow!
You're good.
You look pretty beat up.
That woman and Greed are so strange!
It's like they know where I am in the dark!
What did you say?
They must be the warriors from Xing that Wrath was talking about.
The ones that can feel the presence of us homunculi.
Greed must be using that ability after absorbing Xing's prince.
Damn him...
Gluttony,
how many times did you die?
I don't even know.
A lot.
I was beaten pretty badly as well.
At this rate, we may end up being annihilated by them.
Then we can have Father fix us up-
Huh?
What?
No...
I don't like this, Pride.
No!
Don't eat me!
That hurts...
Help me... Lust...
He... ate his own comrade...!
Wow.
This is convenient.
It's quite simple to distinguish your scents.
Although the hunger that came with the ability seems like it'll be a pain.
Huh?
This scent...
Are you nearby,
Hohenheim?
It appears as though Mustang is sneaking about with his old underlings.
If he has something to do with the train explosion and all the Ishbalans that have infiltrated Central...
Just when I thought things couldn't get any worse...
You all must know his thoughts better than myself.
If you were him, what would you do next?
If it were me, I'd get Madam Bradley in my hands first.
Take her hostage?
What a useless act.
Intentionally making himself seem like a traitor by taking a useless hostage, eh...
Humans are so incorrigible.
Hey, what are you doing?!
Roy Mustang?!
Sorry for causing trouble this late at night, Madam.
Lieutenant Hawkeye!
Why would someone like you do this?!
Pardon my rudeness.
We have no intention of harming you if you don't resist.
Please, come with us.
Memories.
They are recollections of the heart.
If those who are not human come to possess memories,
people begin to fear the result.
Next time, Fullmetal Alchemist:
Episode 49, Familial Love.
With each of their own thoughts in their chest, they see the daybreak.
Are you not going back?
They're going to leave you behind.
A grave of a comrade?
No, an Ishbalan child.
The body was left abandoned on the side of the road.
Let's go back.
The war is over.
Inside my heart, the battle in Ishbal is still not over.
No, I'm sure it never will be.
I'm the one who believed in you and entrusted you with my father's research.
I'm also the one who chose to enter a military academy, wishing for the well-being of the people.
Even if that brought an outcome that I didn't wish for,
I can't escape from the truth.
I can't compensate for it.
I have a favor to ask of you, Sir Mustang.
Please burn the skin off of my back.
How could I do such a-
At the very least!
If I can't compensate for it, then at the very least,
I'd like to destroy this secret to flame alchemy on my back,
in order to ensure that the world will never see another Flame Alchemist.
Could you please do that for me?
Please set me free.
Please set me free from what my father burdened me with...
From alchemy.
Please release me from this.
Please.
I understand.
I'll burn it off your back with the least amount of scarring possible.
Thank you, Sir Mustang.
Episode 54, Beyond the Raging Fire.
What's this about, Lieutenant?
Who do you think you're pointing a gun at?
Who?
Don't make me laugh.
The Colonel always calls me 'Riza' when we're alone together.
Dammit!
So you guys have something going on?!
Just kidding.
Thanks for falling for it, Envy.
I'm going to need you to die here.
That hurts, you bitch!
Damn you...!
You shoot too much!
I'll turn you into a rag and show you to the Colonel-
Colonel?!
What do you think you're doing to my irreplaceable subordinate?
Don't be so reckless, Lieutenant.
I thought I told you I'd take care of him myself.
How dare a lowly human like you look down on-
Dammit...!
This again-
So this is your true form.
You look disgusting.
So your name 'Envy' comes from 'jealousy'.
Now I get it.
No...!
Stop...!
Jealousy sure is disgusting.
No! I don't want to die!
N-No!
Get out...

Nooo!!!
...of my sight!
What's this about, Lieutenant?
That's enough, Colonel.
I'll take care of the rest.
One more blow will do the trick.
Lower your gun.
I cannot consent.
Please put your hand down.
Stop joking!
I'm ordering you to lower your gun!
Fullmetal.
Hand him over.
I'll say it once more.
Hand him over.
I refuse.
He deserves the worst death possible.
I refuse.
Hand him over!
If not, I'll set your right arm ablaze along with him!
Well said!
I'll fight you head-on!
But before we get to that, take a good look in the mirror!
Do you plan on standing at the top of this country with a face like that?!
That's...
That's not what you've been working your ass off for, is it?!
A subordinate protects their subordinate, and so forth.
That should be possible, even for us puny humans.
Sounds interesting.
I'm in.
I want to see what kind of changesyour naive ideals will bring to this country.
So you're going to let your emotions take overand descend to the path of a savage.
I guess that's fine.
If you're going to insist on living for revenge, I won't stop you.
Hey!
I don't have the right to interfere with someone's revenge.
I'm just interested to see what kind of world will be created by someone held prisoner by hatred.
I won't let you kill Envy, Colonel.
But still, I don't plan on letting Envy live either.
I'll take care of him.
I...
I finally tracked him down!
I know that!
But...

You're trying to dispel your hatred.
That intent alone is gnawing at your heart.
You can't fall down that path.
Shoot me if you want.
But what will you do after you kill me?
I don't plan on living free and easy.
After this battle is over,
I plan on taking flame alchemy, an art that brings about madness, to the grave along with my body.
That won't do.
I...
...can't lose you.
What's with this situation, I wonder.
Being scolded by a child,
and being cautioned by a man who had been after my life for revenge.
I made you go through something dreadful again.
I'm the biggest idiot in the world.
I'm sorry.
Are you guys retarded?
Now you're just sugarcoating your words?
Are you playing a game of "let's be humane"?
You're making my skin crawl.
Are you humans really that extravagant?
Just do what your instincts tell you!
You haven't forgotten, have you, Colonel Mustang?
Scar's been after your life!
If I recall...
...it was also Scar who killed the runt's friend's parents too, right?
Oh yeah, and the chimera made from the girl and the dog from East City!
Wasn't it also Scar who killed them?
And on the other hand, you, Scar!
What happened to that hatred you had,due to so many of your brethren being killed in Ishbal?!
That woman over there got all puffed up from being called the "Hawk's Eye",
and shot to death many of your friends!
This is the greatest chance for all of you!
Come on, just do it!
The cast is assembled!
Hate, cry, kill, be killed, and writhe in agony!
Get down on all fours!
There's no way you pieces of shit can just hold hands and be jolly!
Come on, puny runt.
Come on, Hawkeye.
Mustang!
Scar!
W-Why?
Hey, why?
Hey. Hey! Hey!
Why is this happening?!
W-Why?!
Why the hell?!
Envy.
You're... jealous of humans.
Humans are supposed to be a lot weaker than you homunculi,

they continue to get up and fight.
Everyone around them helps them get on their feet.
And you're envious of those humans.
By sacrificing something minor,you'd be able to save something major.
It's a simple concept if you just think about it.
Humans can't shoot me if I do this, right?
Well, that's what makes you all human.
But if I'm going to transform, wouldn't it be better to turn into someone young and pretty?
Humans are so foolish.
They risk their lives for something so futile.
They're human, after all.
Humans...
Humans...
Hey! Stop trying to get away!
Whoa, hang on!
Idiot! If you force yourself out...!
Ow!
Hold it.
He doesn't have much longer.
This is a disgrace.
Being turned into a rag like this...
Being beaten up by you humans...
Beaten by an existence on the same level as shit...
And to make matters worse,
a brat like you who's shitty even by a human's standards...
Dammit!
Dammit...!
Dammit!
This is a disgrace!
A disgrace!
I, Envy, am jealous of humans?
I, Envy?!
It's the greatest disgrace...
...to be understood by a brat like you.
I don't know how much longer you can get away with sugarcoating your words,
but do try your best.
Good-bye...
...Edward Elric.
So he took his own life.
What a coward.
His wounds are healing!
Monster!
Hey, what the hell is that?!
Good timing! Lend us a hand!
What do you mean?
We were ordered to shoot Major General Armstrong!
What?! Major General!
Even the Major?!
Yes, good timing.
From here on out, I'm in charge of this squadron!
No questions asked, just lend us a hand for now!
Whoa, what the hell are those?!
Everyone, duck!
Bullets do nothing against them.
Destroy their upper jaws!
At the very least, they won't be able to bite you to death.
Team up with a partner and take down at least one of them.
Show me the courage of the soldiers at Central!
Y-Yes, ma'am!
Umm...
What am I supposed to be doing again?
Oh, I remember now.
I need to kill the female general.
I won't let you!
You're in the way.
Only being able to use one arm is a bit...!
Major!
General!
He's going to get beaten to death!
Someone needs to go help him!
Leave him be!
There's no way a beating like that could bring my younger brother down, considering the way he trains!
This is...
...the end.
Major!
My shoulder joint is back in!
That's it!
A collaboration of artistic muscles and artistic alchemy.
Both excellent and elegant!
Yes.
The Armstrong Mansion is completely empty.
Dammit, so they were building tanks in here?!
This is the battlements of the main gate!
Give me the mission headquarters!
We're under attack by tanks that are presumably from Briggs!
Mission headquarters!
Don't shout at me!
I can see that for myself!
It doesn't matter! Fire back!
But the civilians have yet to evacuate!
The main gate will be down if we were to wait for something like that!
Headquarters!
Contact the main gate artillery squadron-
Dammit, what's going on?!
You're going to open fire on the urban area?
I'm going to have you repeat that on the radio too.
You scum...!
That equipment is from Briggs!
How did you get in here?!
Well, there's a man with a good memory who used to work at Central Headquarters,
and happened to remember this location with pinpoint accuracy.
There was also a person who dug an underground path between here and the urban area,
all by herself.
There's no one in this world who could do such a thing!
Oh, but there is.
W-Who?!
If someone were to ask me who I am, I would tell them I'm a housewife.
That's what I usually do, but...
I guess today, I'll tell you my other occupation.
An alchemist!
You're alone?
I figured you'd bring your sons.
It doesn't take very many people to scold a brat who committed a blunder, does it?
The Dwarf in the Flask,
Homunculus.
Slave Number 23, the man who gave me a part of his body.
This time, you'll become a part of my body.
































Humans, think about what you must do now.
Think about to whom you must prove yourself to,
and why this is.
Next time, Fullmetal Alchemist:
Episode 55, The Adults' Way of Life.
Walk forward proudly with your head held high.Brother.
Hm?
What do you think about the rumors of the High Priest of Liore?
Miracles, huh?
He creates flowers out of nothingness, right?
It could just be a sleight of hand, but...
But if it isn't...
Yeah... It could be what we've been looking for.
A heavenly stone that destroyed Xerxes overnight.
The great elixir that had been sealed away by a sage from the west.
There are many names for it, but to put it simply, it is something that reinforces alchemy.
That is the philosopher's stone.
If we had this, we could get your body back...
Dammit! Why is this all that's written down?!
Al.
Yeah?
Wouldn't it be great if it's the real stone this time?
Yeah. Definitely.


Ed, Al, where are you?
Oh my...
Scattering Daddy's studies again.
Hey, no doodling on the floor.
I'm not doodling.
Watch!
That's... alchemy, isn't it?
Did you learn that from Daddy?
How do we learn from someone who's not even here?
It was in the books we read.
Was in the books...
Were we not supposed to?
No, of course not!
You boys are amazing! As expected of Daddy's children.
I'm going to have to brag to everyone about you two!
Mom praised us.
Because we liked that, we started getting into alchemy.
But... in the summer of that year...
Mom passed away due to an epidemic.
Brother... I'm hungry.
It's cold, too. Let's go home...
If Dad comes home-
Don't talk about 
He's not our Dad!
He didn't even come back for Mom's funeral.
I wonder if we could bring Mom back...
But one of the books said thattransmutating humans isn't allowed.
So... We'll keep it between us, all right?
You guys are here again.
What do you want, Winry?
Grandma said that if you cry for someone who's passed away, that person grieves as much as you cried for them.
We're not crying!
You're the one who cries all the time 'causeyour parents are always gone and you're lonely!
I-I never cry!
Really?
I'm sorry I was ever worried about you now!
If you get home later than me, you don't get any supper!
What the heck is that? Wait up!
W-Wait for me!
Itadakimasu!
Ed, you have to drink your milk, too.
I hate milk.
If you don't drink it, you'll be a runt forever.
Who are you calling a runt, you midget hag!
What was that?! You pea-sized runt!
Minimum hag!
Micro runt!
You're no bigger than an ant!
You're no bigger than a flea!
You were reading your book in school again...
You have to pay attention in class, you know.
Oh, shut up.
So, what book were you reading?
It's a secret.
None of your business, Winry.
That's no fair! You two always keep little secrets!
Later!
Ed! Al! We're having stew tonight!
Awesome!
Okay. We'll see you later!
The person who invented stew is amazing.
There's milk in it, yet it tastes so good.
What the heck?
The fact they thought of adding milk to vegetable soup is amazing.
It's important for scientists to drastically change their thinking sometimes.
I wonder...
Yeah!
Human transmutation probably needs something drastic like that, too!
From then on, we researched human transmutation...
...and improved our abilities by training withour alchemy master in order to revive our mother.
It took many years, but...
"I want to see Mom's smiling face again."
"I want to live happily with Mom again."
With those thoughts in our hearts, we...
There.

Right.
Brother, something's wrong.
Al!
Could this be... rebound?!
Brother!!!
Brother! Brother...
Brother!
BROTHER!!!
Al?
Huh? What was I doing?
Yo.
Who're you?
Why, thanks for asking.
I'm an existence that you folks like to call "the world".
In other words, the universe. In other words, God.
In other words, truth. In other words, all.
In other words, one. And, I'm...
...you.
Welcome.
Mr. I'm-an-idiot-who-acts-all-high-and-mighty.
So noisy...
Isn't this what you wanted?
I'll show you the "truth".
It was as though all of the information in the world was shoved directly into my head.
Stop it! My head's gonna burst!
I'm being disassembled...
No! Stop it!
Stop!!!
I felt like my head was going to crack open.
But I suddenly realized.
This is the "truth".
M... Mom...
How was it?
That's right...
There were no errors in my human transmutation theory...
But I'm missing something!
If I had gone a little further...
I would've found what I was looking for; the truth to human transmutation!
Please! Show it to me again!
No, no, no.
I can only show you that much for that toll you've paid.
Toll?
Yes, toll.
Equivalent exchange, is it not?
Mr. Alchemist.
Dammit! Like I'd let this happen...
This... This wasn't...
Dammit!!!
They took it away!!!
Help me... someone...
Mom... Mom...
No way... No...
This isn't...
This isn't what I wanted!!!
Al... Alphonse...
Alphonse! Alphonse!!!
Because of me...
Alphonse!!!
Dammit... Dammit!!!
Give him back... He's my little brother...
Whether it be an arm or a leg...
Or even my heart! You can take it!
So give him back...
He's my only brother!!!
Yo. You were still hangin' around in Central?
They're letting me return to Eastern Headquarters.
Well, good work.
You'd better at least be a Brigadier General the next time you come, all right, Colonel?
You say that as if it's a walk in the park.
Oh yeah, if you're going back,I'll go ahead and give this to you now.
What is it?
It's the final report about Isaac McDougal.
You haven't seen it yet, have you?
Yeah.
Eastern Alchemy from Xing? 
Apparently, something like that exists.
To be honest, I've got no idea, but...
Do you have a clue?
No, never heard of it.
By the way, how are the Elric brothers doing?
I'm not their keeper.
Hey, why did you have Ed become a State Alchemist?
He's still a kid, you know?
As long as you're in the army,you will experience hell someday.
Just like we did.
Hell, huh...
If it's hell, they've seen it already.
Plenty of it, in fact...
4 Years Later
Lt. Colonel, they're not in the backyard ei-
What is this...
Where are they?
Where are those Elric brothers?!
Pipe down, Den.
To customers, you have to...
Hey! What business does a soldier have here?
I just came from your house!
What in the world is all that?!
What did you make?!
Sorry... Please forgive us.
We're sorry... We're sorry...
We're sorry...
You're...
I was shocked.
I heard there was a talented alchemist, so I came here.
To think that a child performed human transmutation, though it was incomplete,
and even managed to affix a soul.
He has more than enough to be a State Alchemist.
If he became a State Alchemist, he'd have to fight as a soldier during times of emergencies.

They may be able to discovera way to recover their bodies...
After these boys staggered in herecovered in blood, I went to their house.
That...
That was not human!
Is alchemy what allowed them to create something horrible like that?!
Then I'm against it!
Are you telling these boys to look at hell again?!
Please.
Thank you.
Umm... Lieutenant...
Just call me Riza.
Riza Hawkeye. Nice to meet you.
Ms. Riza...
Have you ever shot somebody?
I have.
I don't like soldiers.
Because Mom and Dad were taken to a battlefield and killed there.
And on top of that, you two are trying to take Ed and Al, too...
Whether they come or not is up to them.
Yes... up to them.
I won't force you.
I'm just presenting you with the possibilities.
Whether they want to move forward or stay stuck in place.
Whether you want to end your life in despair or bow down to the army, seeking what possibilities lie there.
It's those boys who have to make the decision.
If the possibility lies on that path, then you should move forward to return your body to normal.
Even if that path is a muddy river.
Why did you become a soldier, Ms. Riza?
Because I have someone I want to protect.
We're leaving.
Yes, sir.
Well, this is good-bye, young lady.
My name is Winry.
I see. Winry.
I hope we'll meet again.
I wonder if he'll come?
He will.
But his eyes looked spiritless...
You think so?
Those... were burning eyes.
You won't regret it, will you?
Nope, I've already decided.
How long would it take for both the surgery and rehab?
I'd say about three years.
One year.
You're gonna be coughing up blood.
Al, put up with it for a little longer, will ya?
I'll put you back in your body.
Yeah.
But when that time comes,you're going to get your limbs back, too.
Yeah.
Your body's all fixed up now, don't you think?
Yeah! Just alchemy left to train now.
Since I haven't used it since.
Oh, so you haven't used it since you affixed my soul.
Brother!
Perfect, perfect.
That's amazing, Brother! You did it without a transmutation circle!
Just like how our master does it!
You can do it, too, can't you?
No, Brother.
You didn't see it?
See... what?
No... never mind.
Hey!!
You transformed my automail, didn't you?!
So you're gonna transform my head instead?!
Ow... geez...
Uncute machine freak.
Like I care if I'm not cute!
I'm fine with being a machine freak, too!
I've decided to support you until you get your limbs back!
Wha?
It's quite rare that you've decided to watch the exam, sir.
Well, I heard that a twelve year-old was being tested,
so I just thought I'd drop by so I would have something to talk about with my family.
Ah, an arm made of steel...
I got it during the civil war in the east...
Yeah, we sure had a lot of trouble with Ishbal.
Who's that guy?
Idiot! That's FÃ¼hrer President King Bradley!
Now, let the examination begin.
Do you have something to draw a transmutation circle with?
I don't need something like that.
Without a transmutation circle...
Now this is quite something...
Your Excellency!
...And some military figure may be assassinated like this, so...
You guys might want to think about changing this examination.
Hmm, he's certainly got a lot of pluck.
But he doesn't understand the size of this world.
Good luck with the rest of your exams, young alchemist.

When did he draw his sword?
I wonder if Brother is doing all right on the exams...
Hey, Al.
Hm? What's up?
If Ed becomes a State Alchemist...
...will you be leaving this town?
Yeah.
This is the badge of a State Alchemist, the silver pocket watch.

Your certificate and the agreements are... here...
The FÃ¼hrer President has given you quite the ironic title...
What?
No, congratulations.
You're now a dog of the military.
I, FÃ¼hrer President King Bradley, hereby appoint...
...thou, Edward Elric, as a State Alchemist,
and bestow thee with the title, "Fullmetal".
Fullmetal?
That's right.
The second name that's given to all State Alchemists.
The name that you'll be carrying is...
"Fullmetal Alchemist".
I like it. Sounds like something heavy to carry.
But I'll do it.
Brother, we're almost there.
Liore, huh...
There should be some clue there on how to get Al's body back...
The philosopher's stone...
Ed and Al, arriving in the city of Liore, meet Cornello, a man who preaches the revival of the dead.
Pray and believe, and thou shall be saved.
As Cornello preached those words, he wore the bright, red, philosopher's stone on his finger.
Next time, Fullmetal Alchemist:
Episode 3, City of Heresy.
What, exactly, is the happiness that can be earned by turning away from reality?
