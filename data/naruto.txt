Yeah, turn your sadness into kindness, your uniqueness into strength
Even if you get lost, let's start walking
One more time
Are you really happy
when you're always meeting to someone's expectations?
Even if you change to who you really wanna be
Will you always have a great smile?
Dreaming of only "the beginning," I wake up
and someday, I'll live on my own.
Yes, precious things are never in shape
You never know what it is when you get it or lose it
Yeah, turn your sadness into kindness, your uniqueness into strength
Even if you get lost, let's start walking

Where am l?!
I've been saved.
Oh?
Awesome... He's pretty darn big...
Oh yeah...
This is a...frog... isn't it...?
Oopsadaisy...
Let's see now...
No tail!
This is...!
Not like this one.
Or that one.
It's really...
A real...
Frog!
He Flies! He Jumps! He Lurks!Chief Toad Appears!
Looks like he extracted theChakra of the Nine-Tailed Fox
all on his own this time.
But still, one certainly can'tsay he's stable yet...
He overused the large Chakra...
To think that of all the frogshe summoned that one...
I did it...
Hey, you little brat!
Huh?
Huh? Huh? Huh?!
You little brat...
On whose head do you thinkyou're raising a ruckus!
This is the top of Gamabunta,the Chief Toad's head! You idiot!
Quiet down...
Oh!
W-What the heck is this guy?!
He seems pretty awesome, but...
Gimme a break!
Just when I'm breathing the air ofthe free world after a long time,
some weird kid is raisinga ruckus on top of my head.
Hey! Jiraiya! Where are you?!
What the heck doyou think you're doing?!
Hmm... This doesn't look good...
'Cause even I can't handlethat Gamabunta...
Jiraiya! Hurry up andshow yourself, you idiot!
Hmmm... It would be troublesome ifthat Gama found me out...
I better get my ass out of herewithout any further delay.
Hey, little brat!
Y-Yes...?
Where's Jiraiya?
Huh...? Jiraiya...?
Who's that...?
I'm talking about that lecher whocalls himself Toad Sage or something!
Where's Jiraiya? Huh?!
S-Scary...
If you just follow my orders,
I wouldn't mind making youmy henchman!
Hurry up and answer me!
Okay! If you're talking aboutthe Pervy Sage,
he's on the cliff up there,Chief Toad.
Up there, huh...?
Um... Can I ask you one question?
What is it?
What business do you havewith that Pervy Sage?
That's the question I wantto ask that pervert!
What the heck does he wantsummoning me to a place like this?!
B-But...
What is it?
I'm the one who summonedyou, Chief Toad..
I fell off the cliff...
and thought maybe youcould come to my aid...
Please...
Hmm...?
What does a kid like you thinkhe's saying out of the blue.
There's no way a little squirt likeyou could summon a guy like me.
It's... it's true...I really truly summoned you...
Believe it!
You jerk frog!
Huh...?
You've been condescending to me
and saying whatever youplease since earlier on!
Since I summoned you,I'm your master!
Huh...? What was that?
Hey, who do you thinkyou're talking to?!
A little squirt like you,
who isn't even able to exchange cupsof sake as a pledge of friendship,
is saying to Lord Gamabunta,that you're his master?
I could kill you for that! Hey!
Huh...
Oohhh...
It looks like he emerged on top,that Gamabunta...
Awesome...
I hate to tell you this, little brat,
but even if I were to concedea hundred steps to you...
No, concede a thousand steps to you,
and even if it really was true thatit was you who summoned me...
If you're the kind of guy whofalls off my back that easily,
there's no way I couldadmit you as my master...
Huh?! Huh...?!
Now then... I'm here in thefree world after a long time...
If Jiraiya doesn't haveany business with me,
I think I'll kick back for a while.
Hey! Wait!
Why don't you just go homeand sleep or something?
'Cause it looks like you're incapableof serving even as my henchman.
Darn it!
W-What the heck do you thinkyou're doing, you little brat?
If my making you recognize thatI summoned you
depends on my not fallingoff your back, then...!
Then I won't get off your backthe entire day today no matter what!
What?!
And by my doing that I'll makeyou recognize me as your master!
You little brat! Don't get all carried awaythinking I'll go easy on you!
Huh?!
Fall!
Chakra adhesion!
There's not enough Chakra!
Listen carefully, Chief Toad!
My name is Naruto Uzumaki!
I'm a man who will become Hokagein the future. Don't forget that!
Who cares!
This is getting pretty interesting.
Hey!
Oh my gosh!
Sorry Naruto,but I've gotta get back to work!
Research...research...
Bust off!
Welcome!
I'm gonna eat my fill.
Huh... Those guys areeating barbecue again, huh?
A reward for having trainedearnestly... maybe?
I thought you were told not tolet Gaara out of your sight...
Don't worry...even somebody like him...
wouldn't dare to do anythingin broad daylight.
More importantly,that guy Shikamaru or whatever,
he's the first guyyou're fighting, right?
Shouldn't you be formulatinga battle plan?
Humph... There's no way I wouldlose to a guy of that level...
Besides...
You botched it, didn't you?
Huh?
If you had taken the examone year earlier,
you would have madethe Chunin easily...
Don't say it...
What was that?!
The upcoming Chunin Exam...
I'll have the three of you fromour Sand Village take the exam...
But the reason for doing thatis not to pass the Chunin Exam!
It is to use the opportunityof the Chunin Exam...
to crush Leaf Village!
But why...? Don't we havea treaty with Leaf Village?!
That treaty is the problem.
Oh.
What do you mean?
You Genin are not aware ofthe detail but...
At the time the treaty was concluded,
that idiot feudal lord of Land of Windnot only aggressively scaled down
the arsenal ofthe Hidden Sand Village...
he delegated to the Leaf Village
matters that should have been handledby our country, and moreover,
significantly cut our country's budgetand slashed the number of Shinobi.
When we have an idiot leader,
we, the arms and legsof the country, suffer.
The only choice we had leftwas to improve the quality
of each and every Shinobi in orderto maintain our country's military power...
That's why Shinobi likeyou were created...
Gaara...
The Land of Wind's security isin extreme danger right now!
But the aidesof that idiot feudal lord...
don't have a clue!
Lord Kazekage,
who detected the weakening in the militarystrength of the Hidden Sand Village,
joined hands withthe Hidden Sound Village
and decided to take downthe Hidden Leaf Village...
In addition to restoring SandVillage authority...
this needs to be done in orderto make that idiot feudal lord
aware of the importance ofcrisis preparedness...
If any more time passes,our Sand Village will totally lose
its military capabilitiesagainst the Leaf Village...
Now is the only chance...
The success of that mission...Gaara... depends on your work...
Yeah...
If the strategy is carried out,
it will certainly lead to warwith the Leaf Village.
We'll be at war again...?
The cost to human life in implementingthe treaty was very great...
and if it is broken...then again...many people will die...
H-Hey... Temari...
This is the will of Lord Kazekage.
Of Lord Kazekage?
After all, Shinobi are simplytools for fighting.
The treaty did nothing more thanjeopardize our very existence.
This is a super A-rank mission.
See it through with great care!
Okay.
Yes...
A day sure is long whenone's not doing anything.
I guess...
Darn... What an obstinate little squirt.
Goodness...that Naruto seemslike he's in agony...
He must have exhaustedmost of his Chakra
when he summoned Gamabunta...
Look, look, isn't that pretty...
The rainbow...
Gorgeous...
Yeah, yeah, absolutely gorgeous, isn't it.
Good work, Baki.
Lord Kazekage, I successfullymoved all three pawns
to the real battle as planned.
The agreement with the Sound Village sidehas been progressing with no problem too.
Yes, sir.
This is...
A decisive action plan fromthe Sound Village.
You still have something you want?
Well...
What is it? Come out with it.
Yes, sir... I was wondering if youcould position some soldiers
near the border on the pretext ofundertaking a tactical exercise.
With only the four of us...
The Leaf Village isn't idiot either.
Their Anbu black opsare moving about.
If we do that, they will see right throughwhat we're contemplating.
But with only our currentmilitary capability...
That's why I sent Gaara andthe others out there.
The restoration of the authority ofthe Hidden Sand Village is resting on you.
Well... Go.
Yes, sir.
There's only a little more time remaininguntil the sun sets completely...
and if I don't fall off...
I'll be the master!
What's that to me?!
You came up with thiswhole thing unilaterally.
I'm not falling off, no matter what!
That Naruto...he's already way past his limit...
I wouldn't be surprised ifhe fell off any minute now...
I could simply ignore whata brat like him says...
but taking a lick really irritates me.
I'm gonna bring thisto an end once and for all...
Hey, brat... what's your name?
Naruto!
It's Naruto Uzumaki!
Naruto Uzumaki... Naruto!
Don't hold it against me if you die!
Oh...
That Gamabunta!
Now it's a matter of pride for him, too!
Huh?!
This won't do!
No! This is the sizzling young ladies'entertainment spot!
I'm not falling off whenI'm so close to succeeding!
Hey!
Oh...
What?!
That Naruto...
He's squeezing out yet more Chakrafrom that condition he's in.
I'm falling...
How do you like that, Gamabunta?I'm still on your back!
It's my victory!
Oh no! If he falls like that he'll die!
Too bad for you... You almost made it.
To think that he could hold out like thatagainst a tough opponent like Gamabunta...
Hm?!
That, Jiraiya, meddling in...
I am fully aware of the fact that...
this guy here summonedme all on his own.
I mean, it's the first time sincethe Fourth Hokage
that somebody climbed on my head.
As might be expected,he must be totally drained.
I don't mind dispensing someof my power to him but...
Taking him to that place would be best.
Huh? What!
One! First, Tyson jumps and slamdunks
Two! He kisses and hugs everyonerandomly and says "l LOVE YOU"
Three! Masala masters Yogabut hates curry
Four! Sanchez is a lousy bullfighter. Ole!
All over the world, the sky's smiling,so look up and smile too
Oh yeah! Oh yeah! Oh yeah!Fight! Fight! Fight!
One! Bodimahattaya-san devoteshis time for digging black ships
Two! Peking Duck, Action Scene,Chen Lee speeds around on his bike
Three! Popo loves to polish his Coteka
Four! Japanese people,now lend me you hand!
All over the world, the sky's smiling,so look up and smile too
Oh yeah! Oh yeah! Oh yeah!Fight! Fight! Fight!
All over the world, the sky's smiling,so look up and smile too
Oh yeah! Oh yeah! Oh yeah!Fight! Fight! Fight!
The hospital roomwhere there is no one.
The uninvited visitors...
The childhood phantasmsare repeated in the daydream.
The moment whenthe forbidden door is opened...
That guy appears.
Next time, "Hospital Besieged:The Evil Hand Revealed!"
Who is the next victim?!
C'mon!
Running like a fugitive,
Being chased by something
Inside my heart is pounding
My throat dry like it's withering
For no single one,
To none does belong,
This time is ours, right now...
Unraveling the pain,
Unraveling our hearts,
Unraveling shadows
Stifling our breath,
Reaching for beyond,
Tearing through the dark
In fighting and in love
To the distant light above,
Yes, we are on the way
I wanna rock...
Rockin' my heart
This is good!
Bit by bit,I'm figuring out the timing...
He read my movement.
No way could he do that!
Darn!We were so close...!
Naruto, can you still move?
Of course! I'm totally fine!
He's pretty much spent...and it's no wonder.
Shadow Clone Jutsu usesa lot of Chakra.
But thanks to him,we found our way out.
I found the way to break through!
Hah! Impossible!
That was just a coincidence.
Naruto! Run!
Run out of here andattack from the outside!
A-All right!
You won't be able to...!
I-I'm not going to lose!
There!
Fire Style: Fire Ball Jutsu!
Darn!
T-That was good just now!
What?
We're doing it one more time!
All right!
It's likely that there's a limitto that guy's Chakra, too!
To prove that,he's little by little...
This won't go as you've planned.
First, I'll get you!
Sasuke!
Darn! It's been a while sinceI've fought in such bad conditions.
And I'm worried aboutSasuke and Naruto, too...
Be calm... Think...What will he come after?
Oh no!
What?!
Too late!
The Broken Seal
That was Sakura’s voice!
Did something happen?
What's that Kakashi doing?
Sa... kura...
Darn it... I must do something...
I'll do something about it...
T-This guy...
Here I go...
It's pointless to struggle.
Naruto, behind you!!
Naruto!
It's impossible for youto get out of here.
I mean it.
Can you stand up, Naruto?
Y-Yeah...
From now on,don't waste your Chakra!
You're playing right into his hands.
I know.
Darn it!
If things continue like this,it's going to be really bad.
I...
I have to do something.
Strangely, my eyes have adjusted...
It's about the time I putan end to this for you...
What?!
Stand up, you idiot!
I'm aiming for a vital spot...but he's parrying all of them.
I know...you're so persistent!
A coincidence...o, that's not it.
On the contrary, he's fightingwhile covering for his friend.
Surely, my movements...
That boy...he can see something.
What in the world...?
Okay, in that case...
He disappeared.
Where, where did he disappear to?!
Naruto! Don't faint!
I can't take care of youany more than I am now!
Who asked you to take care of me...
It seems that kid hasreached his limits.
Tsk...
Amazing...That's an amazing move.
You move well...
Wha--?!
But I'll stop youwith the next one.
Motor function...
Reflexes...Ability to judge a situation...
All of these things...should be at their limits!
He's coming!
Calm down...
Focus!
And...See everything!
He saw through absolutely everything?!
No way...
Those eyes...
It can't be...
Sharingan...
You are...
Only a little, but...
I was able to see!
So, you also have the powerof Kekkei Genkai...
What a kid...
It's not perfect yet,
but to think that in the middle of a battlehe was able to rouse this power...
If that's the case,I can't fight him too long...
This Jutsu uses a lot of Chakra.
There are also limits to retainingthe teleportation speed.
Besides, the longer the fight continues,
the more my movements will enterinto the range of his "reading. "
In fact, his eyeshave already captured me.
It would be foolish to aimstraight at him.
In that case...
I'll use that kid to lure him in!
What?!
Let me make it in time!
K-Kakashi Sensei!
You were late enteringto guard, Kakashi.
Your whole-hearted intent to helpthose kids has gone to your head,
and it seems to have cloudedyour Sharingan
with even heavier fog.
Even though you havethose impressive eyes,
your ability to read your enemy'smovements is getting cloudy.
Amuse me more, Kakashi...
I want to repay my debt inan amusing way.
Don't worry. Anytime now,Haku is going to defeat those kids.
You better apologize to themin tears
when you are in "the next world"for your lack of strength.
Sasuke will be defeated...?
That's not true!
Sasuke is...
Cha!
Not by that guy!
Cha!
He won't be defeated!
Cha!
Naruto won't either!
That's right.
Huh!
I...believe in their strength.
Naruto is the Number One Hyperactive,Knucklehead Ninja...
And Sasuke is a member ofthe most excellent clan
in the Hidden Leaf Village!
That can't be!
Yes...His name is Sasuke Uchiha...
He bears within his body...
the famous Kekkei Genkaiof the Uchiha clan!
He's a Ninja genius.
He's the remaining survivorof that tragic clan?!
No wonder he grows so quickly.
But...
That's the same as Haku.
Nobody has ever beatenthat secret Jutsu of Haku's
Not one person in the past...
Well then...
It's about time I settled this too, huh.
Sakura, don't move from here.
Uh...ah... okay!
No, I'm going to putan end to this!
For God's sake, you...
just won't quit...dragging my feet, will you?
You did it!Sasuke...!
W-What kind of expressionis that...
You... idiot...!
W-Why?!
You protected me...?!
How the hell...should I know?
Sasuke...! Sasuke...! Sasuke...!
Hmph...
You...
I hated you...
Why? Why...?
Why... me...?
I didn't ask for your help!!
I don't know...
My body moved... of its own accord...
Fool...!
Sasuke!
That man...
Until I defeated... my brother...
I absolutely refused to die...
That's what I decided, but...
You, don't die...
He...
To protect someone dear to him...
he would plunge inknowing it was a trap...
He's a Shinobi worthy of respect.
Is this the first time you faceda friend's death?
This is the way of the Shinobi...
Shut up!
Even though l...hated you too...
I won't forgive you...
I'm going to kill you!
What is this Chakra?!
It can't be...
For Chakras to be tangible like that...
A-And...what a ghastly Chakra that is...
The wound on his hand...It's healing instantly...
This boy...
Who in hell is he...?
Is it Zabuza...?
No!
This sinister Chakra was once...
It can't be!
What is... this Chakra?
It feels foul...
Kakashi?o, it's too big to be Kakashi's...
Who is it?
Naruto...!
Oh no...
At the time like this...
The seal has broken...?
I have to hurry!
He's coming!
How dare you!
You ruined Sasuke!Damn you!
Sasuke's dream...
What about dream?!
Darn you! Darn you! Darn you!
Because of your dream...!
Next time:"The White Past: Hidden Ambition"Here we are, here we are,here we are!
"The Golden Time"!
Starting tonight, "NARUTO" will be airingevery Wednesday, from 7:27 at night!
- Leader... Leader...- For those who always watch "Naruto,"
and also for those who are watchingfor the first time, please enjoy!
Now, the new opening theme song,
"HARUKA KANATA (Far Beyond)"is about to start!
Listen here! Leader!
W-What is it Konohamaru?I was just getting into it...
It's only 7 o'clock.
What?
You're 27 minutes early.
This is actually the time slot for"The Prince of Tennis."
W-What?!
W-W-What are we going to do?
- I already did the greeting!- It's not my problem...
I don't care anymore!I'm going to start "NARUTO"!
Hey, Sakura, Sasuke.
Naruto went ahead andstarted the program.
Are you ready?
No, no! I'm still in the middleof my facial!
What about the VTR for the main show?
It hasn't arrived here.
I guess it can't be helped.
I'll have to do some dancing...
Nah! I mean I'm going toget the VTR.
In the meantime,you guys will have to fill up the time.
What?!
I'm depending on you.This is your mission.
Huh, a mission... all right!
All right, we'll do it!
Hey, Naruto!
This is all your fault for being so careless!You have to learn your lesson!
Ouchh....
Go Go!
Press down hard on the gas
That's right, there's no compromise
We'll slip through the night
At the final moment push hard
That's right, all the way to zero,
Until we wipe away the days
Gently open your heart
If you pull it close to you
It will reach you, without a doubt
It will come, closer
Now
We're speeding through life,squeezing it for all of its worth
Our feet are tied
But we still keep going farther
Even if I take it back, and grasp it
If you're not the one
There will be no meaning
And so we'll go far off into the distance.

Huh?

Moreover, on top of the grass?

Special Report:Live from the Forest of Death!
Chapter of Character Introduction
Please introduce yourself.
Okay!
My name is Naruto Uzumaki!
A Ninja from Village Hiddenin the Leaves!
My hobby is to play pranks,and I love ramen noodles,
I've just become a Genin but...
My dream is big, to become a Hokage!
And I'm going to surpass allthe Hokage from the past,
and make everybody in the townacknowledge my existence.
I've been called a failure and such,but I graduated splendidly and,
as a member of Group Sevenled by Kakashi Sensei,
I am dealing withdifficult missions every day!
Distance from the target?
5 meters.
I'm ready anytime.
In Group Seven, there is alsoSasuke and Sakura.
Since I'm really the only one that showsgreat success,
you don't worry about the other two.
I got you!
Don't say such things.Introduce them properly!
Is the target correct?
I know, I know.
The target confirmed.
For example, this guy's name isSasuke Uchiha
and he's a pretentious guy.
I heard that he's one of the lastremaining of the famous Uchiha clan,
but he really is a pitiful guy, like this...
Oh, this was when I transform but...
as long as you understand the greatnessof my Ninja skills that's all that matters.
Oh, and this is Sakura Harunowho is in love with me.
You know, the more she denies it,the more I'm convinced it's true.
She hardly tells me howshe really feels about me but,
her shyness makes her even cuter!
Is that true?
It really is true, true.
Who's in love with Naruto?!Cha!
It was a lie after all!
I'm sorry...
Well, putting that aside,three of us formed a team
and got through a bunchof dangerous missions together.
Hey you...
What?
Oh, Missus!
I've gotten rid of all the weeds!
What?What's wrong?
Those...those aren't weeds...
Huh?
Those are herbs I grew in my garden!
Ouch, ouch, ouch!
Somebody! Help...!
No!
Free Fall!
You idiot.

Hey!Please stop!
That fool...
Geez... All because hestubbornly chose that big dog.
This is a dangerous mission?
It only looks like you're being clumsy, Naruto.
Yikes!
Well, there were times like that too.
Do it over.
Transform!
Oh, this was when I defeatedthe Old Man Hokage.
This isn't going to make a good article.
Fine, then you show me how to do it.
Fine! My name is Konohamaru...
The grandson of thetown's chief Hokage.
Grandfather is the most important figurein the Leaf Village
and is the third Hokage.
Those who succeed the Hokage nameis the top Ninja of the village.
Especially the 4th Hokage is a great herowho protected the village
from the demon fox!
Hey, hey, hey wait!
You're only talking about other people!
I was just about to start on myself!
Besides, Bro, you talk too muchabout yourself!
Of course, I am the star of the article,other people don't matter!
You're right, Naruto...
Of course, you're going to forgetabout me
when you graduate from the academy.
But you can introduce me for a bit...
Oh, yes, yes...
He is the first person in the townwho acknowledged me, Iruka Sensei...
He's a really nice person,
he always treats me toramen noodles at Ichiraku.
Am I just a nice person becauseI treat you to ramen noodles?
Oh no...well... that's...
Don't laugh it off!
Big brother, next up,I'm depending on you!
Oh, you're right!
Then, I guess I could talkabout Sasuke's stories of failures...
I've already heard that one.Get more serious!
That Naruto...!
I bet he's just making upstuff as he pleases...
Humph!
Who cares...
This is good-looking Kakashi.
How is the situation over there?
This is cute Sakura.
Naruto is somehow managingto fill up the time.
More importantly, how is it over there?
Are we going to make it in time?
We'll be able to deliver by theend of the commercial break, I think.
Oh and don't forget to tellthe viewers about the present.
Roger that.
Kakashi Sensei...Kakashi Sensei, please respond.
I wonder what happened?
He said that he'd be back bythe time the commercial ended.
It can't be helped.Sakura, you have to continue.
What, me?!
Sakura do your best!
Why are you there?!
Well, it can't be helped,I guess I'll have to do it.
Chapter of Ninja Art
Well, now we'll have Sakura Haruno,
who is my senior as a Kunoichi,teach us about Ninja Art.
Yes, I am the beautiful Kunoichi,Sakura Haruno.
Beautiful?
What, you have any complaints?
Oh, no...
Transform!
Well first, Naruto's Ninjutsu...
Sexy Jutsu,
Shadow Clone Jutsu!
Shadow Clone Jutsu.
Transform!
- Transform!- Transform!
- Transform!- Transform!
Harem Jutsu...
I call it, "Harem Jutsu"!
And something like this.
Hey!
It's his fault that he's late!
Dropping the blackboard eraser...
Next is the number one rookie, Sasuke,
who graduated asthe top student at the academy.
You won't get me by attackingstraight on.
The most popular one in class, he canalso fight Kakashi Sensei as an equal.
Sasuke is awesome!
Your Sasuke introductionis taking too long.
Naruto, you're so noisy.
Stay quiet.
Horse!
Tiger!
Fire Style: Fire Ball Jutsu!
What?!
That's not a Jutsu Genin can use...
He couldn't have enough Chakra!
Demon Wind ShurikenWindmill of Shadows.
Shuriken won't work on me.
I'll do it.
C-Could that be...?
Sharingan!
Is that, the Sharingan...?
If this is the same Kekkei Genkaias Kakashi Sensei's...
he can read Bushy-Brow's Jutsu!
Genjutsu or Ninjutsu...it's some kind of magic either way.
I'll reveal that!
Although you have seen Sasukeusing powerful Jutsu like
Fire Style: Fire Ball Jutsu,Demon Wind Shuriken,
Windmill Shadow, and Sharingan,
the greatest of all is...
the sharp look of his eyes!
Any girl who has been staredat with those eyes,
will fall in love with him!
Sasuke!Look this way!
You're...annoying.
Well, that cold behavior is alsoanother attractive quality of Sasuke...
Next is our teacher,Kakashi Hatake Sensei,
also known asthe Copy Ninja Kakashi.
He uses the Sharingan in his eyeto assess the enemy's technique
and copy overa thousand Jutsu techniques.
But he's always late to meet people,and whenever he has any time
he always reads this questionable bookcalled Make-Out Paradise,
and he always looks like hedoesn't really care about things...
Leaf Village Secret Finger Jutsu:
A Thousand Years of Death!
And the biggest mystery of allis his face hidden under that mask!
I wonder what he really looks like...
Ninja Art, Summoning,Earth Style: Fanged Pursuit Jutsu!
If you can't use your eyes or ears,simply use your nose.
That's what happens whenyou're closing your eyes in the midst of fog.
This is the Summoning Jutsuspecialized for pursuit.
On top of all that, why does hehave the Sharingan in his left eye
that is only passed on in the Uchiha clan?
One mystery after another whenit comes to this person,
so many things that I don't understand...
I should ask him next timeI have the chance.
Lightning Blade!
What the...?!
His hand is...visibly overflowing with Chakra!
You are too dangerous.
Water Prison Jutsu.
Oh no!
Secret Jutsu.
Crystal Ice Mirrors!
Next up are the Ninjutsu ofthe other Ninjas besides us.
There's such a diverse collection ofinjutsu that I have no time to explain all...
Chapter of Rivals
Please, Sasuke,whom I feel is like my future self,
take care of the next part.
Sure. After all, I have be the oneto do something about it.
I knew that from the beginning.
Don't try so hard to look cool.
Sasuke, the snob.
Don't interfere.
Stay out of it, loser.
Annoying.
Shut up!
I hate the fact that only you stand out.
Nobody strong around youshows any interest in you.
What the...?!
Just watch this.
Hey!
You there...What's your name?
I'm Gaara of the desert.I have an interest in you as well...
What's your name?
Sasuke Uchiha.
Hey, you there.Identify yourself.
Dang it!Again? It's always about Sasuke!
When asking someone his name,give your own name first.
You, with the unpleasant look.
Wait a minute!
Why don't you fight with me here now?
I AM going to take out the Bushy-Brow.Believe it!
The one I want to fight isn't you...It's Uchiha.
Everybody says Sasuke, Sasuke!It's annoying!
It's true!
Nobody thinks that you'rethe main character leader!
That's not true, they're all just blind!
Huh... As usual you're just aboutthe talk and not the walk.
That's not true!
Leaf Whirlwind!
See, you are just about the talk.
Uhh... even Sakura is picking on me.
The students who gathered forthis Chunin Exam are all skilled,
and are the cream of the crop...
Shikamaru Nara, Choji Akimichi,Ino Yamanaka,
Hinata Hyuga, Kiba Inuzuka & Akamaru,and Shino Aburame...
You won't never be able to winwith the way you have been fighting.
You must understand that, right?
Y-Yeah! Of course!
You, too. Be careful not to letyour guard down
so you won't be defeatedby some lame guy!
Huh! Of course!
That's right...
We passed the first stageof the Chunin Exam and
are heading to the locationof the second stage...
No matter what kind of adversitymay lie ahead,
we will not be afraid!
And we will pass the examto become a Chunin!
Because we...we...
have the greatest teamworkthat was formed by a strong bond!
Okay! Let's go!
Thank you so much for cooperatingwith the interview!
- Thank you...- Leader!
Do your best!
Yeah leave it to me!
- Bye!- See you!
- Do your best!- Good luck!
Oh guys... I'm sorry I'm late.
A cute girl started talking tome on the way, and I danced for a bit.
And that's a lie!
Well, don't say that...
I did bring the VTR like I said.
You have to praise me.
Yes, Kakashi Sensei you're great!
Now we can see the rest of the show!
Everybody look forward to it!
Oh, before that the commercial break...
Hey, can you hear it?
The clear, blue sky goes on and on
The ocean spans limitlessly
Please keep that smile on your face forever
Or else I'll cry
You won't have to search around you
It's all ok now.
Everyone is insidethis hand
when you want to cry, and you want to run away
When you forget what happiness is
Just sing.
Light is born, and darkness was born
The two are one
Harmonia, feel the telepathy
Hey, can you hear it?
The 44th Training Field,also known as the Forest of Death.
From here on it's a serious battlebetween the Ninjas,
anything could happen!
It's going down in earnest now!
This is getting interesting!
A life-risking survival game in the forest!
I will survive without fail!
Next time: "The Chunin Exam Stage 2:The Forest of Death!"
As for me, I'm going to kick butt again!
C'mon!
Running like a fugitive,
Being chased by something
Inside my heart is pounding
My throat dry like it's withering
For no single one,
To none does belong,
This time is ours, right now...
Unraveling the pain,
Unraveling our hearts,
Unraveling shadows
Stifling our breath,
Reaching for beyond,
Tearing through the dark
In fighting and in love
To the distant light above,
Yes, we are on the way
I wanna rock...
Rockin' my heart
I see. Sakura, you've come, too.
Now you can formally registerfor the Chunin Exam.
What do you mean?
Actually, from the start,
only three-man squads couldapply and take the exams.
But Sensei, you said that the decisionto take the exams
was up to the individual.
Yes... I said that.
Were you lying?
Yes, I was...
If I said that,
Sasuke and Naruto would probablyforcefully convince you to take it.
Even if you didn't havethe will to apply,
if Sasuke asks you
you would attempt to takethe exams half-heartedly.
For Sasuke's sake and,well, Naruto's.
Then, if...
it had only been Sasuke andaruto who had come here?
I would've stopped the Exam here.
I wouldn't have felt like lettingthem go beyond this point.
But... you guys came hereon your own will.
Sakura!
Naruto!
And, Sasuke!
I'm glad you came.
You're a team I'm proud of.
Now then, go on!
Okay! Let's go!
Genin Takedown!All Nine Rookies Face Off!
W-Wow!
W-What's with...this?
There are so many of them...
Could it be that they're all applicants?
They...all look...immensely strong...
Sasuke, you're late!
I thought I'd be able to see youfor the first time in awhile,
so I was waiting in excitement.
Get away from Sasuke!Ino-Pig!
Oh, my. It's Sakura.
Your Billboard Brow hasn't changed, eh...Ugly!
What did you say?!
What's up with this?
Huh?
Are you guys going to takethis bothersome Exam, too?
Oh, it's the idiot trio.
Quit calling us that!
Man, this is a freaking bother...
Shikamaru Nara.
Always complaining,has no motivation.
He's a bellyaching idiot.
Choji Akimichi.
He's always eating something.
That's all he is, a fat idiot.
Sasuke... is mine. Bleah!
Ino Yamanaka.
She's always fighting with Sakura.She's her rival.
A Sasuke-crazy idiot.
Yahoo, I found you!
My my, everybody's here.
H-Hello...
Oh...
Hinata Hyuga.
She's a weird person who turnsher eyes away whenever I look at her!
She's a gloomy and shy girl, I guess.
Kiba Inuzuka and Akamaru.
They're louder than I am!
He always brings his dog andalways has a bossy look.
He really annoys me!
Shino Aburame.
As for this guy, I really don't get him!
He's a type I'm not good with.
What did you say?
You guys, too?!Man.
Ha! I see.
This means all nine Genin rookiesare taking the Exam, eh...!
Now then...
How far can we go?
Eh...Sasuke?
Hmph!...
You're mighty confident. Kiba.
We've trained a great deal, so...
We won't lose to you guys!
Shut up!
I don't know about Sasuke,but I sure won't lose to the likes of you!
I'm sorry. Naruto...
Kiba didn't mean it like that...
Huh?
Akamaru, you've becometasty-looking...
What?
Don't step on it.
Huh?
I said, don't step on it.
You're...gonna eat that?
Hey, you guys!
You should be a little quieter.
You guys are the "rookie nine"...fresh out of the academy, right?
Carrying on like thatwith cute faces... Man.
This isn't a field trip.
Who're you? Acting all haughty!
I'm Kabuto Yakushi.Anyway, take a good look around you.
Behind you...They're from the Rain Village.
They're hot-tempered.
Everyone's tense before the Exam.
I thought I'd warn you guysbefore you get your butts whipped...
I guess it can't be helped.
You're rookies who don't knowleft from right...
You remind me of my old self.
You're Kabuto... right?
Yes...
Then, is this your second time?
No...
It's my seventh time.
Huh?!
This Exam is only held twice a year,so it's now my fourth year.
Then that means you knowa lot about these exams?!
Kind of...
No kidding.Kabuto, you're pretty awesome, huh?
But you haven't passed.
Yeah, well, that is the case, yes...
Is the Chunin Exam that high a hurdle?
Man, this is utterly bothersome...
Then, maybe I'll give a bit ofinformation to my cute juniors.
With these Ninja lnfo Cards.
Ninja lnfo Cards...?
To put it simply,
they're cards that have information burnedinto them and coded with Chakra.
I spent four whole years gatheringinformation for this Exam.
There are close to two hundredof these cards.
They are pure white to the eye...
To open the data on these cards...
What're you doing?
The way it works is thatno one can see the info
without using my Chakra...
For example... Like this...
Whoa, awesome!What information is this?
The number of test-takers andparticipating nations,
and the number of applicantsfrom each respective village
is individually displayed.
Why do you think that
the Chunin Exam is jointlyconducted in the first place?
It's said it's done to deepenfriendship among nations first
and to boost the Shinobi levels, second.
"It's said"?
That's right.
The real aim is in the checking ofShinobi levels of neighboring nations
and keeping power balance equal.
Power...Equal?
Why such bothersome things?
If that's not done,
the weak nations will be invaded bythe strong nations in no time at all
and may end up beingcontrolled unilaterally.
There's a point to mutual supervision.Probably.
Hmph...
Of those cards,
are there ones withdetailed individual information?
Yes, there are...
Are there ones you're concerned about?
Yes, there are!
The information for the applicantsthis time around is not perfect,
but is burned in and saved.
You guys included...
About those "ones you'reconcerned about," who you know.
Anything's fine, tell me their informationand I'll retrieve it for you.
Gaara of the Sand Village,and Rock Lee of the Leaf Village.
Oh, you even know names.
That makes it quick.
Here they are!
Please show me.
Here they are!
Please show me.
I don't really get what's going on,but I'll pretend like I do.
Well then, first is Rock Lee.
He's one year older than you guys.
His mission experience,twenty D-ranks and eleven C-ranks.
His squad leader is Guy...
In just this year, his Taijutsuhas drastically improved, but...
His other skills are not good at all.
Last year, he'd attracted attention asa Genin rookie with his ability,
but didn't participatein the Chunin Exam.
This is his first time taking the exams,same as you guys...
Tenten and Neji Hyuga are on his team...
Huh? Hyuga?
Next...is Gaara of the Desert.
His mission experience,eight C-ranks. B-ranks...
Wow, one B-rank as a Genin, eh...
He's a Shinobi from a different landand is a rookie,
so there is no furtherdetailed information.
But...
It seems he has returned fromall of his missions uninjured.
B-rank as a Genin...But uninjured...?!
What is this guy?
Leaf, Sand, Rain, Grass,Waterfall, Sound...
There are lots of exceptional Geninsfrom those villages
who have come to takethe Exam this year as well.
As far as the Village Hiddenin Sound goes,
it's a village of a small nation thatjust sprang up in recent years,
so there isn't much information...
At any rate,
they're all Hidden Villageswith nothing but crackerjacks.
That kind of makes you loseyour confidence.
Why are you saying that now?
In other words...
all of the applicants whohave gathered here...
That's right!
Not just Lee and Gaara,
but they're all choice top eliteGenin from each nation.
Hmm.
This isn't going to be easy.
I can't go along with this!
They may be your subordinates now,
but they are childrenwho were my students.
If it's about them I know...
It's as you say, lruka.
It's not going to be that easy.
You're too eager.
I postponed my team's test-takingfor one year
and took care to build uptheir skills.
Have them take the Exam afterthey've enjoyed their life a little bit more.
Hmph...
They might be too easygoing.
But they will surpassyour guys in no time.
That's enough.
That's as far asthe rookie matter goes.
Now then, next...
I'll take recommendations for Geninother than rookies.
Well! Don't pour cold water on this...
I said that, nevertheless...
I wonder if even the fearless onesare frightened just this time around.
Stubborn as he is,
he's still consumed by this atmosphereand number of people.
He's tense.
It can't be helped.
Even though everyone is a Genin,we're the newest most inexperienced rookies.
I'm very, very uneasy.
But...
It's kind of tough looking ataruto who's not himself.
Maybe I'll cheer him up a bit.
Say... Naruto! Don't be so scared.
Huh?
My name's Naruto Uzumaki!
I won't lose to any of you!Got it?!
Say! What's with him?!
That idiot would neverget depressed! Absurd!
It won't do any good toprovoke everyone!
Don't tell me!
If I don't tell it to you,who do I tell it to?!
What did you say?!
Oh, I feel better.
Hmph...
Isn't that the guy from before...?
The dog's bark isbigger than its bite.
Is he an idiot...?
He's mighty high-spirited.
He's hot-headed, eh.
Lee, maybe you didnot bully him enough.
Did you hear?
Sound Village is a minorHidden Village of a small nation.
That's offensive.
Maybe I'll... play with them a bit.
Yes, being referred to as somethinglike leftover Shinobis and all.
We'll add this to his data.
Those Sound Shinobisare brutal in their own way.
I won't lose to any of you,you say?
You said it...!
That idiot...
In no time at all, he's made enemiesof his surroundings.
What're you talking big for?! You!
But, I just said what was true, I say!
E-Everyone, that was a joke.
This guy's quite an idiot, you see...
After all, he says idiotic, spazzy,scatterbrained things
and gets carried away,
so please don't concernyourself with him.
Jeez, thanks to you, I got glared at!
I'm going to kick your butt!
Shall we do it?
Let's do it.
Learn how to read atmospherealready, you!
Fine!
These guys...are the Sound Village...
He dodged it!
I can see through that speed.
I see... It's that kind of attack, eh?
What's going on?
He was supposed to have evaded it.
Why'd that happen to his glasses?
Probably grazed the tip of his nose.
He's trying to act strong, so. That punk.
Huh?!
Oh! He puked?!
K-Kabuto?
Huh?!
Hah!
Hey, Kabuto!
Are you okay?!
Yeah... I'm okay.
Really?
Oh, so he's not so special.
Even though he's a veteran who'sbeen taking the exams for four whole years.
Write this on your card.
The three from Sound village...Doubtless Chunin.
Kabuto should've totally read the attack...
But why did he vomit?
Lee. How about that technique just now?
I had no problem reading the speed.
There's some kind of trick...
Silence! Degenerates!
Sorry to keep you waiting... I
I'm lbiki Morino, proctor for thefirst test of the Chunin Exam.
It feels like the chance to show offthe fruits of our training has finally come.
Well, no matter what kindof test it is,
it's gonna be a snap!
I'm picturing Sasuke and thembowing to me and saying,
"Naruto, we're really no match for you!"
Huh? Is this for real?!

Hey, Pervy Sage. What Jutsu are yougonna teach me this time?
The last time was Walk-on-Water Jutsu,so is it gonna be Walk-on-Fire Jutsu?
Or maybe Walk-in-the-Air?
Hurry up and tell me, Pervy Sage!
You keep calling me Pervy Sage.
So you have no idea thatI'm a superb person, huh?
Huh...? A superb Pervy Sage?
Nhaagh... Listen carefully!
Toad Sage is only a disguise!
As a matter of fact...!
North and South and East and West!
I'm the white-maned toad charmer,
and one of the legendary Sannin whomeven celestial beings can't defeat.
Such a stud!
That he strikes fear...in the hearts of people!
I am no other than "Master Jiraiya"!
Yes...I'm talking about me!
Huh...
Jiraiya:aruto's Potential Disaster
Atafuku Town?That's ten kilometers from here!
It's "O"tafuku Town!
Hey... hey...Hey, Pervy Sage!
I'm telling you, it's Jiraiya.Gimme a break...
So the fact that sucha bigwig Pervy Sage like you
is taking me along ashis travel companion means...
that I'm potentially a genius?
Just as I thought!
Hey! Hey! Hey!Why did you choose me?
A long time ago,the Fourth Hokage was my disciple.
And you resemble the Fourth Hokageso much, it's almost funny.
That's the only reason...
I...?
The Fourth Hokage...?
Yeah!
Yeah! Yeah!
W-What is it?
Yeah!
The fact that I resemblethe Fourth Hokage means
that I also possess geniusof his level, right?
I'll become the Hokage, after all!All right!
W-Wait...
I stepped on some dog poop!
About the only areas you resemblethe Fourth Hokage
are your hair and your stubbornness!
What was that?!You senile Pervy Sage!
Not again!
Sakura? Come here!
Okay!
Please take these rice sweetsover to Ino's house.
Ino's house?
These?
That's right...
Don't bother themby staying too long.
Because everyone isvery busy at this time.
I know that!
See you later!
Oh, yeah...
I'll bring some overto Sasuke later on too.
I wonder if he likes sweets...?
And to Naruto too...
Naruto looks likehe would eat anything...
Hey Kakashi Sensei!Teach me Chidori too!
You may say teach me,but it's not that easy.
What the heck's that?!
That's not fair, show me how!Teach it to me.
Sasuke... Thank you...
You rescued me fromthe Sand Ninja, right?
No...
Huh?
For a start, why don't you try gatheringChakra in your palms!
All right!
The person who rescued you...was Naruto.
Like this? Like this?
Oh come on, Sasuke,you're being overmodest again.
It's true that Naruto has gotten stronger,but against that Sand Ninja...
I'm telling you the truth.
That kid fought desperatelyto rescue you.
He showed a kind of strength thathe had never shown before.
Naruto rescued... me.
Oh, it's coming...
Chidori! Huh? Chidori! Chidori!
All right! I'll bring some to Naruto too!
I wasn't...I wasn't able to do anything...
I don't want to watch a precious comradedie right before my eyes ever again...
No matter what,I will protect you!
Multi-Shadow Clone Jutsu!
Summoning Jutsu!
Naruto is getting stronger and stronger.
Compared to him, l...
While you may able tomanage against him,
I couldn't possibly...
He's in a completely different level...
Yeah...
If we go at each other,we'll either both be killed or at best,
kill each other simultaneously.
Even if we increased the numbers,that wouldn't change.
I didn't expect the kid's guardwould be a legendary Sannin.
With him as the opponent...
the names of Leaf Village's Uchiha Clan
and the Seven Ninja Swordsmenof Mist would be tarnished.
Yeah. However...
Any strong one has a weakness...
Stop! You will get cursed!
Hey, hey, Pervy Sage...
Huh?!
What kind of a student wasthe Fourth Hokage?
Well, I guess one could say
that he developed to that extentbecause he was my student...
You're one lucky guyto be taught by me!
- Hmmm...- Hmmm...
Are you dubious?
A good teacher will developgood disciples.
That goes without saying.
Then, then, who taught you,Pervy Sage?
Me?
I learned from the Third Hokage.
The Third Hokage?
That's right...
The Third Hokage wasstill young and lively.
- The Third Hokage... young and lively?- The Third Hokage... young and lively?
That's right!I was young and lively too!
Young and lively?!
I... I got tangled up.
See... You got cursed...
So you learned from Kakashi.
Then you experiencedthe "Bell Training," right?
Huh...?
Yeah! I did! Yes I did!
Only I was tied to the tree trunkand had one deuce of a time...
What? You too?
Huh? What do you meanby "you too"?
Huh?
What do you mean by "you too"?
Why don't you just hurry,get up and return those things.
Even if you were to say that...it's pretty difficult...
There are two bells.
The fact that there areonly two means...
That one of us has to goto the tree trunk...
You're quick on the uptake, Orochimaru.
All right! I'll make it!
Come at me with the intent to kill!
Jiraiya, I won the bet with you, didn't l?
You got tied to the tree trunk,after all.
Shut up!
You flat-chested like a cutting board.
What did you say?!You nerdy perv!
Okay, Okay, that's enough.
Tsunade and Orochimaru go home!
Okay!
You are hopeless...
Ninja shouldn't be getting caught inobvious traps like that over and over again.
But...
Why don't you learn a littlefrom Orochimaru?!
Sarutobi Sensei, you're alwayssaying Orochimaru, Orochimaru!
Hm?
When it comes to snooping,I'm really good at Transparency Jutsu.
Gimme a break...
I don't even wanna know
what level of Transparency Jutsuyou possess...
I've never been caught once!And that's the truth!
If you're that sure of yourself,I'll go with you next time...
You're such a lecher, Sarutobi Sensei...
Huh?! Huh?
What, what?
Hey!
What's so funny?! Pervy Sage!
Huh?
It's just as I said, a good teacherwill develop good disciples.
Huh...? I don't understandwhat you're saying!
Come on, let's go.Did you put it back properly?
Yeah, I fixed them!
See!
It appears that they haven'tfound Naruto yet.
But don't you think that's strange?
Those guys had alreadyinfiltrated the village.
It should be easy to find Narutoin this village.
Itachi knows Naruto's face.
Kakashi...
Why is Kakashi sleeping?
Besides, only Jonin are gathering here...
What are you doing?What in the world happened?!
Nothing... in particular...
Is it true that thatItachi has returned?!
And moreover,that he's after Naruto...?!
Oh...
Idiot...
Why does this always happen?!
So that guy returned to this village?And moreover, he's pursuing Naruto?
What does all this mean?!
Sasuke?!
Where's Naruto?!
Huh? I just got here too.
I wanted to give Naruto...
Some sweets...?
If Naruto is caught by that guy,that will spell his end.
I'm not gonna let him do that!
Hey old man!aruto must have come here!
And do you knowwhere he went after that?
Oh, Naruto, right...
If I remember correctly...
Master Jiraiya came herearound noon and...
They ate ramen together,and he said he was going somewhere...
Where?!
Hmm... I think he said to a post stationsome distance from the village...
And then he left with Master Jiraiya.
Jiraiya?
Jiraiya - one of the genius Sannin.
Well, in appearance,
he just looks likea big white-haired old man.
Big and white-haired...
H-Hey!
Geez... If you're gonnaask somebody a question,
it's only polite to stayand have a ramen or something.
Candies are here.
This town is pretty weird.
Naruto!
Huh?
We're staying here tonight!
What?! I can still walk!
A disciple should obey his master!
I just want to learn the Jutsu!
That's what's called a disciple!
Huh?!
Oh, oh...!
Naruto!
Yes?
Here, this is the key to the room.
Go to the room ahead of me,practice Chakra,
train some and go to sleep!
Got it?!
What?!
"The adult world is gonna beginfrom this point on"...
Is that the vibe, Pervy Sage?!That's not fair!
That post town isn't that far...!
This! Somehow this always happenswhen I'm with that Pervy Sage!
Darn...
Here...
Candies are here!
I've got to check door by door!
Cheers!
I wonder if he really has any inclinationto oversee my training?
What about that one? Yeah that.
See! A hundred out of a hundred!
Do you have a blond kid witha dumb-looking face, about my age
and a big white-haired old manstaying here?
This is an inn for women only...
I'm looking for someone...
Do you have a blond kid witha dumb-looking face, about my age
and a big white-haired old manstaying here?
Today, we only have old people.
Hmm...this is kind of crispon the tongue...
Hey, why are you guys all sleeping?
Do you have a blond kid witha dumb-looking face, about my age
and a big white-haired old manstaying here?
White-haired...?
Are they here?!
Eh... Do I remember seeingsome people like that earlier
when shifts changed...?
This tastes bitter...are you all right with it? Cheers!
Oh! A blond kid anda white-haired old man!
They're here?!What's their room number!
Um...
Room number one atthe end of the hallway
on the second floor...
What's up?Has she already dumped you?
Okay, Okay!
Okay, Okay, I'll open up!
Naruto!
It's not him...
A cycle of hardship, right?
Inside, we were crying, right?
But the one thing we won't give upis the dream we've chosen, right?
It's a secondary role,
a role in the shadows
But in reaching for that dream,
let us stay centered,let us stay true
Over and over,we hung on without giving up
Over and over,we kept coming back up
Over and over,we believed and dreamed
Over and over,we've seen fools
Over and over,we've stood in the shadows of others
Now, it's our turn...Let us bask in our dreams
Darn it! My body is frozen!What is this creepy feeling?
This guy is absolutely notan ordinary person.
He's got the same Sharinganas Sasuke.
He's a member of Uchiha clan.
Is this the guy Sasukewas talking about?
Next time: "Roar, Chidori!Brother vs. Brother!."Press down hard on the gas
That's right, there's no compromise
We'll slip through the night
At the final moment push hard
That's right, all the way to zero,
Until we wipe away the days
Gently open your heart
If you pull it close to you
It will reach you, without a doubt
It will come, closer
Now
We're speeding through life,squeezing it for all of its worth
Our feet are tied
But we still keep going farther
Even if I take it back, and grasp it
If you're not the one
There will be no meaning
And so we'll go far off into the distance.

Sasuke!
Naruto's certainly differentfrom you, Sasuke.
He's a klutz and kind of gets in the way.
But he's not in the least a coward!
Right? Isn't that's right?!
Sasuke!
You foolish little brother.
If you want to kill me, resent me,hate me and...
continue to live your ugly life.
No...
Flee.
Flee and hang on to your life.
No!
No!
The Sharingan Revived:Dragon-Flame Jutsu!
Just what I expect of the Uchiha clan...
His blood has begun to stir...
I should take my time andconfirm his true power.
I have to live so I can killmy older brother...
That's what I thought.
But it's me who was being stupid.
Naruto!
Sakura!
How can someone who can't puthis life on the line at a place like this...
beat that man?!
I can see.
I can see!
I can see you!
It's pretty good...
You foretell my movements andyour aim is sure.
You can see my moves, can't you?
The sun will set soon...
I must find him quickly!
It will become completely darkand my disadvantage will increase.
But why in the world right now...what's his goal?
Well, that's fine...
He came to this village.I'll settle this here and now.
I got you!
A substitution!
Sasuke!
Humph!You are too easy.
The Uchiha name is crying.
That's okay.
I'll just take my time and playwith you before I'll kill you.
Like a worm.
This is Sharingan Windmill Triple Attack!
Fire Style: Dragon Flame Jutsu.
He did it!
Sasuke!
You did it!
Are you okay?
Hang on.
Paralysis?
I didn't expect that you could useSharingan this much at your age.
You are truly a memberof the Uchiha clan.
I do want you, after all.
You're definitely his brother.
Your eyes hide more abilitythan that Itachi.
Who in the world are you?
My name is Orochimaru...
If you think you want to meet me again,desperately run to the top of this test.
- The Scroll!- Defeat the three...
Sound Village Ninjaunder my control.
You are not making sense at all!
We don't want to seeyour face ever again, got it?!
That won't do.
Sasuke!
Sasuke!
You, what did you do to Sasuke?
I gave him a parting gift.
Sasuke absolutely wouldcome look for me...
Iooking for power.
I enjoyed seeing your various powers.
Sasuke!
Hold on, Sasuke.
C'mon!
Sasuke...
Sasuke, c'mon!
Sasuke...
Sasuke...
Naruto!
Sasuke's... Sasuke's...!
Naruto!
What?
What should I do?
I can feel it!
He's close by.
It's been a while...
Anko.
You're level S class,
an extremely dangerous person onthe most wanted list.
That's why I'll kill you hereeven if it costs my life.
That is my duty asyour former subordinate
who learned it all from you.Isn't that right, Orochimaru?!
No, you can't.
Striking Shadow Snake!
I won't let you escape.
I got you.
Orochimaru,I'm gonna borrow your left hand.
This hand sign...
Right... you and I are going to die here.
Ninja Art: Twin Snakes Sacrifice--
You intend to commit suicide?
Substitution.
As you are a Special Joninof the village,
you can't be just usingthe forbidden Jutsu I taught you.
I told you it wouldn't work.
Why have you come now?
It's our reunion after so long,and you're awfully cold.
Don't tell me that you cameto assassinate Lord Hokage?
No, no...
I don't have enoughsubordinates for that yet...
I've heard of the excellence ones ofthis village and thought I 'd put dibs on it.
A little while ago,
I gave that same Curse Markas a present.
There's a kid that I want.
Selfish as always.
That kid will die.
Certainly... the odds are 1 in 10that he'll die,
but he may survive just like you did.
This kid, you really like him, huh?
Are you jealous?.
Hey...
Are you still holding a grudgethat I used you and threw you away?
Unlike you, that kid will excel.
For one thing he inheritedthe Uchiha ability.
He has beautiful features and isa vessel who can become my heir.
If that kid lived,it will make things interesting.
Be sure not to cancel this test.
Three people from my villageare also under your care.
Make me enjoy it.
If something happens todeprive me of my fun,
consider it the end of Leaf Village.
We've secured food and water afterspending half a day
and now most teams have halted activity.
As we planned,this is the time that we attack.
We'll split up into three and go scouting.
However, whether we findother teams or not,
we return to this place.
Got it?
Okay.
Roger.
Okay.
Scatter!
His breathing is graduallygetting regular...
but he still has a terrible fever.
I have to protect them both.
I have to communicate thisto Lord Hokage right away.
Cripes! At a time like this!
T-This is Paralysis Jutsu.
So you are here, Anko.
You're pretty late for Anbu Black Ops.
Well, don't say that.
Are you okay, hey?
Huh? T-This is...!
The Curse Mark is appearing...
Don't tell me...?!
Is it Orochimaru?
What, really?
Now that it's come to this,we'll take you to Lord Hokage.
No, take me to the tower.
What are you saying?
The moment Orochimaru comesto this village,
a strict alert is issued.
It's more urgent thancontinuing the Exam.
I know...
Anyway, I 'll tell the whole story later,so please call for Lord Hokage.
I found you.
As Orochimaru ordered,we'll wait for daybreak to do it.
Sasuke Uchiha is our target,not the other.
If they come in the way,it's okay to kill the other two, right?
Of course.
Hey, can you hear it?
The clear, blue sky goes on and on
The ocean spans limitlessly
Please keep that smile on your face forever
Or else I'll cry
You won't have to search around you
It's all ok now.
Everyone is insidethis hand
when you want to cry, and you want to run away
When you forget what happiness is
Just sing.
Light is born, and darkness was born
The two are one
Harmonia, feel the telepathy
Hey, can you hear it?
The beautiful wild beast of Leaf Village,Rock Lee, is here!
Yeah, I did it!I did it, Guy Sensei!
Now I can get Sakura's heart,right on the mark!
You could say, in terms of numbers,the disadvantage is mine!
But on the contrary,the conditions have been met.
Guy Sensei, I will use that techniquewithout hesitation.

Hinata Hyuga vs. Neji Hyuga
Withdraw! You're not suitedto being a Shinobi.
You don't have the privilege ofdeciding what a person is like, stupid!
Hinata, give it to him!
Naruto...
Don't just take it! Argue back!
I'm getting irritated watching this!
Naruto...
Thank you!
The expression of her eyeshas changed...
So you're not going to withdraw?
I'm not taking responsibilityfor what happens...
I don't want to run away!
Byakugan!
Brother Neji! I challenge you!
Here!
A Failure Stands Tall!
As I thought, this is the extent of it...
the head family's power!
What the--?!
But Hinata laid a perfect strike!
N-Not yet...
What's with this guy...!
I-It can't be....
Well, now....
I guess this is why he's calledthe most gifted of the Hyuga clan yet.
Y-You mean... All this time...?
That's right! I can seethe Chakra Points.
W-What is he talking about?!
On the Chakra Network...
there are 361 energy centersor Chakra opening,
each about the sizeof the head of a pin.
They're called Chakra Points.
Theoretically, hitting one directlycan halt or increase Chakra flow,
enabling one to gain complete control overan opponent's flow of Chakra.
Just so you know,
not even my Sharingancan see Chakra Points!
Having the penetrating eyeis one thing,
but to hit it so accurately likethat during a match,
well, that's just...
Lady Hinata...
What we have here is an unchangeabledifference in abilities.
It's what distinguishesthe elite from the failure.
It is brute, unalterable fact.
You were destined to regret having said
that you don't want to run anymore,the instant you said it.
And now, you must haveabandoned yourself to despair!
This is your ultimatum...
Withdraw!
I-l...
I-I meant it...
and am... sticking by...
every word...
Hinata...
I said!
I'm not gonna run away!
Because that's... my Way of Ninja!
I had no idea...Hinata was this tough...
She's a lot like you.
Come to think of it...She's always watching you.
Huh?
Hinata...
Bring it on!
She has reached her limit.
One more blow and...
Neji's hits to Hinata's Chakra Points
have completely haltedher flow of Chakra.
That means she can no longersend Chakra
into her opponent's bodyto fight in the Gentle Fist.
This match is as good as over.
But I never imagined there wouldbe someone this powerful...
I'm afraid even our Sasukeis no match for him.
It looks as if Neji may very welltake this Exam.
It's going to take more than whatthis girl has to bring him down.
L-Look at those eyes...
Is he going to try to kill her?o, no, that's absurd.
Doesn't it seem that...
Neji's strength is somehowagainst the rules?
He's just too powerful...
I mean it!
Go, Hinata!
Naruto...
Strength has come backinto her eyes...
I've been watching you...
I've been watching you closelyfor many years now!
Why I wonder...?
Next up is Naruto Uzumaki!
What a pain!
It's all your fault!
Like I care!
Okay!
Naruto... d-do your best.
Transformation!
I don't know why, but...
I am Naruto Uzumaki!
I'm not about to lose tothe likes of any of you!
Is that perfectly clear?!
I'm not about to lose tothe likes of any of you? Yeah, right!
That idiot.
He made a roomful of enemiesin the space of an instant.
When I watch Naruto...
Naruto, stand up!
If you compete with mefor the name of Hokage...
You... will be the loser!
I can feel courage welling up.
I feel that I can hang on,that I can do it...
that I too am worth something!
Oh!
- No!- Hinata!
Hinata...
At some point, Hinata, who wasin the habit of just giving up,
made up her mind to change.
Hey, Hinata. It's time to go home.
She put every ounce ofher being into her training.
I saw it with my own eyes.
But even so, she continuedto fail all her missions.
She lost her nerve whenfaced with real competition
and became easily discouraged.
But today's Hinata is different.
I have never...
seen...that look in her eyes before.
Naruto.
I have always donethe watching up to now,
but, now, finally...
finally, I am...
Naruto!
You just don't get it, do you?
Your strikes were ineffectivefrom the very first.
It's the end.
Hinata... That's enough.
You lost the match,
but you've become a new personin the process.
You did well.
I want to change that about myself...
So I proposed it myself...
Neji's final blow wentstraight for the heart.
I feel sorry for her,
but she won't be standingagain now.
As further fighting is not feasibleunder these conditions...
Don't stop it!
Don't stop the match!Believe it!
Naruto, stop!
What on earth are you saying, stupid!
She's had it. You can seeshe's unconscious...
Huh?
Why do you stand up?
If you continue like this,you'll really die!
He is now finally forthe first time truly seeing me.
I will not be caught looking bad...
Why?!
in front of...
the person I admire most.
I-I am far from finished!
Give up the bravado...
I can tell you're justbarely standing.
You've shouldered the lotof having been born
to the head family line of the Hyuga...
And cursed and blamedyourself for being weak...
But, people cannot change.
That's just the way it is.
There is no need for youto suffer any more!
Surrender to it!
You're wrong...Brother Neji.
Because I can tell...
that you are sufferingmuch more than l.
What?!
You are the one who is torn up
over the fate of headand branch family.
Neji, the match has been called!
Oh boy!
Neji, get a hold of yourself!
You promised me
you wouldn't let the head familything get you riled up!
Why are all the other Joninbutting in?!
The head family getsspecial treatment, eh?
Hinata?!
Hinata!
Hinata!
Hinata!
Hinata! Are you okay?!
Hey!
Naruto...
Yeah.
I...
Do you think...
I...changed maybe a little bit?
Hey you, failure!
I have two piecesof advice for you.
First, if you intend tocall yourself a Shinobi,
stop that revolting cheering of yours.
And the second...
a failure will always be a failure.
There's no changing that!
Do you want to see about that?
You!
Naruto, I get where you'recoming from, believe me.
But all fighting must bedone officially in a match!
The failure beats the gifted geniusthrough sheer effort...
Wouldn't that make foran exciting main battle?
Though, I am probably goingto be the one fighting Neji...
but it would be okay with meif you ended up fighting him, Naruto.
All right already.
So this is okay then,right, Guy Sensei?
Lee! You....
Nice going!
Oh, no! She's gone into ventricle fib.
Was he trying to kill her then?!
The precious little time you havewould be better spent
seeing to her than glaring at me.
Medics!
Hurry! What's taking so long?!
S-Sorry.
Get her on the stretcher.One, two, three.
It's serious. She 's got about1 0 minutes at the most!
Get her to the emergency room.Pronto!
Out of the way!
Hinata...
Because that's my Way of Ninja.
I promise you.
I will win no matter what!
Hey, can you hear it?
The clear, blue sky goes on and on
The ocean spans limitlessly
Please keep that smile on your face forever
Or else I'll cry
You won't have to search around you
It's all ok now.

Harmonia, feel the telepathy
Hey, can you hear it?
The Absolute Defense of the Sand?
They say no one hasever injured Gaara.
He's strong as heck andhas no weak points.
Bushy-Brows is no match for him...
But wait, he's not losing!
He seems a lot faster than before.
Is this due to his training?
I am getting excited about it!

A hot spring?
Yeah, just off of this roadthere's a nice town with a hot spring.
Yunosato Hot Springs...
They say it does a world of goodfor fatigue and beauty.
Aren't we going straight home?Everyone's waiting!
Naruto's right.
Our hometown is ina state of emergency,
there's no time to procrastinate.
It won't make much differenceif we're one or two days late...
It's really popular with girls,and it's mixed bathing...
Hey?! Pervy Sage?
Sometimes it's necessary for humansto take breathers.
We'll take one bath!
That's not what you said before!
It's okay. Well, let's go!
That's her, no mistake.
We've finally...found her.
Kidnapped!aruto's Hot Spring Adventure!
We have the pleasure ofa visit from four people and one piglet.
- Welcome!- Welcome!
Even though this has mixed bathing...
I'm all alone with this brat.I'm so unlucky.
Well then, shall we play pachinkoor something?
We have plenty of time before dinner.
You're not going to the hot spring?
If we go right now, there are fools...
So, let's go, let's go.
I'm going to get out already.
Not yet, not yet.ot until the girls get here.
Oh, I see...
Well, c'mon girls.All of you, come on...
Welcome!
Ah, that was refreshing.
W-We've been robbed!
The necklace I got fromOld Lady Tsunade is gone!
Where! Where is it?!
"If you want your necklace back,give back the money"?
"Will wait at the three cedars onthe mountain behind!"
Signed, the Akagi Family.
Money?
What are they talking about?
Girls came in, all right.
But...
they're all female monkeys!
I want to bathe with people.
Hey, here I am!
Come out! Akagi Family!
What do you want, kid?!
That's my line!
I haven't borrowed any moneyfrom you people!
So give me my necklace back!
"My" necklace?
Did we mistake his stufffor that woman's?
Ah, that's it!Give it back!
W-Wait!
Shadow Clone Jutsu!
Go!
You thieves!
- Take this!- Go!
H-Help...
People came, all right...
But...
They're all men!
- Bring it on!- Cheers!
I want to bathe with women...
Huh? So the one who borrowed moneyis Old Lady Tsunade?
Yes... nicknamed"the Legendary Sitting Duck."
She played at the Akagi gambling denuntil she was penniless.
We loaned her what she lost.
That's right, and there's an l.O.U.
Wha--?! There are so many zeros!
I'm Senta, this guy is called Bunzo.
The boss ordered us to collecton the debt three years ago...
We set out on a journeyfrom Akagi Mountain
prepared not to returnuntil we get the money back.
We've heard rumors aboutthe lady here and there...
But, she sure was something.
She was elusive and quite hard to find.
Then recently, we caughtsome information that she'd appeared.
We were waiting onthe side of the road...
That's when we came alongwith Old Lady Tsunade.
But why did you raid the roomso stealthily?
Rumor has it that
that ordinary means don't workagainst the "Legendary Sitting Duck."
We didn't think thatif we tried to collect amicably,
she would pay us.
She's certainly stingy...
We heard that she cherished the necklacenext to her life,
so we thought she'd payin exchange for it.
No way. After all, you raided my room.
We never even dreamed that the ownerof the necklace would have changed...
Err... Can't you ask the lady to pay?
Uh, even you say so...
Please! If we don't get the money back,we can't go home!
Our wives and kids are waiting for usto come home!
- Please... I'm begging you!- Please... I'm begging you!
It's all gone...
Bad luck...Darn it. I'm stone broke.
Well, let's call it quits with pachinko.
It's about time for a bath...
- Shizune...- Yes?
My bag is at the front desk of the inn.
What?!Y-You can't mean to bring it here?!
Everything to your name is in it...
I've just lost! I can't repress this feeling!
Just bring it without complaint.
Yes, ma'am!
Huh? Could you be...
Y-You are...!
There are women, all right...
But...
I was hoping for younger,more titillating women...
This one, right?
Thank you...
Are you with Ms. Tsunade?
Yes.
This came for her not long ago...
To TsunadeA letter? I wonder who could've...?
Lady Tsunade! Lady Tsunade!
Lady Tsunade!
Huh? Lady Tsunade!
She's not here...
Okay, Tonton...
You know to search forLady Tsunade, right!
What, impossible? Why?
I see! The smell of the sulfurfrom the hot spring interferes...
Well then, the only wayto search for her is on foot!
Lady Tsunade!
Lady Tsunade! Lady Tsunade!
Lady Tsunade! Lady Tsunade!
Where are you!
We have a problem!
Lady Tsunade!
Oh, what in the world should I do?
We have Naruto Uzumaki.
If you want him returned unharmed,please return all of the money you owe!
We'll wait by the three cedars onthe mountain behind. The Akagi Family
What should I do?I have to help Naruto.
On top of that, if it's discoveredthat Lady Tsunade has a huge debt,
talk of her installment asthe Fifth Hokage will probably end.
That's right, we haveto handle this by ourselves.
Right, Tonton?
Do you think it's going to work out well?
No problem.
Here she comes.
Old Lady Tsunade!
Stop!
You know who we are, right?
You're the henchmen of the Akagi.
Then I'll make it brief.
Pay back your debtin one lump sum.
Or else...
his life is over!
Help me!
Whatever.His life doesn't matter much to me.
- Huh!- What did you just say?!
Well then, the money...
Why did it come to this?
This isn't titillating,this is just tight!
Drats! Let me have patience!
Didn't you hear me?
It doesn't matter to mewhat happens with his life.
You... darn old hag!
Was what I would have said,until just a little bit ago, I think.
Once I become the Hokage,he'd be a precious subordinate.
I can't leave him in the mess.
Old Lady Tsunade...
Right now, this is all I've got.Take it.
Let me make sure of this.
I don't mean it's paid off in full,but that'll do it for the interest, right?
Fake!
You're not going to paythe money back?
It's none of your business.
These guys can't go home!Don't you feel sorry for them!
You couldn't possibly?
In that case, I'll have to use forceto get it back!
Naruto's Shadow Clones?!
I see, Naruto has joined handswith the Akagi Family...
So, where did Naruto and company go?
As expected...
I didn't think she'd handthe money over meekly.
But to be that much of a coward...
What should we do?
Old Lady Tsunade has a huge suitcase.
No doubt there's money in it.
We have to do somethingto get our hands on that suitcase.
Shoot!
I'm supposed to be kidnapped,and she's casually drinking sake.
It's that suitcase.
How do we get it out?
Leave it to me.
Lady Tsunade, you've returned.
Ah, here's the suitcase.
It's dangerous,so let's leave it at the front desk.
Well then...
Look, I went and got it!
- You did it!- You did it!
Old Lady Tsunade!
Shoot... If you're the Hokage...
If you're the Hokage,
then pay your debt backlike a Hokage would!
A Hokage is meantto protect everyone!
These guys can't return their home,they are desperate!
Why don't you do something?!
Naruto...
Or do people from other countriesnot matter to you?
That kind of Hokage...I cannot accept!
Now!
Here!
Hurry up and run away!
- Right!- Okay!
Oh, she's already catching up!
It's all or nothing!
Huh?
- You did it!- You did it!
Tonton?!
Naruto!
Just hand over the suitcase! Or else!
F-Fork over the suitcase!
If we take a direct hit fromOld Lady Tsunade's attack,
then it's over!
Out of the way, out of the way!
Purse snatchers?
Excuse us!
Hey what's going on?!
Hey! Don't cause troublefor the general public!
It's because you're following us!
Shadow Clone Jutsu!
Shadow Clone Jutsu!
What's going on...?
Naruto, we leave it up to you.
This is no good.
If the contents of that suitcasebecome known,
it will be a disaster...
That's right, that happened too.
And I was young then too.
Gulp it down.
Excuse me, Boss.
What is it? You're in front of a guest.
W-Well...
A clone!
That's a clone too?
Wrong again.
Sheesh, which is the real one?!
The rest...
- Where are the rest?!- Where are the rest?!
Over there!
- Hold it!- Hold it!
- Naruto!- Naruto!
- Wait!- Wait!
- Naruto!- Naruto!
Prepare yourself!
Shoot, let me go! Let me go!
Settle down!
G-Got it!
The money!
Okay, they got it!
IOU's?!
It's not money?!
- Oh no...- This is too much!
What are you doing?!This is in the middle of town!
Huh!
T-Two Old Ladies?!
You're mixed up inthis commotion as well?
I'd like to hear your reasonfor it, Shizune!
Hello... Lady Tsunade...
What?! Shizune...
And you guys belong to the Akagi.
B-Boss Jirocho!
Who?
You don't know?!
He's the number one gang boss,Jirocho from the Land of Tea!
He's an old friend of mine.
As luck would have it,we met by accident on the street.
You're Bunzo and Sentaif I'm not mistaken.
Just in time.I have something to say to you!
- What?!- What?!
You mean the debt to the Akagi Family?
I paid it back a year ago.
Is that true?
That was last year,when we were near Akagi's.
Did you forget?
I-I'm sorry.
Hey!
It's a circular from Akagiaddressed to me.
I'll just read the part addressed to you.
"Senta and Bunzo,
"The debt is paid, come home soon."Signed, Shugoro Akagi.
See?
You've gotta be kidding.
All that energy spent, for nothing.
- Thank you for helping us.- Thank you for helping us.
- Now we can go home relieved.- Now we can go home relieved.
Go in good spirits.
- You too, Naruto. Take care!- You too, Naruto. Take care!
Hey, if the suitcasedoesn't have money in it,
why were you so seriousabout getting it back?
That's...
If the IOU's were discoveredby the people in the village,
they'll oppose Lady Tsunade'sinstallment as Hokage.
You worry too much.
The Hokage and the debtare unrelated.
Not only that,she said she returned the money,
so there's nothing to worry about.
At least the Akagi debt was...
What?
Don't worry, don't worry!
What? We forgot something?
Finally, the time has come.
Communal bathing with girls...
Patience paid off...
I believe your promise,its a true heart give me courage
Always I feel itthe precious time with you
On your still shoulder
I feel the wind that blowstowards tomorrow
The city lights are like pieces of stars
That hold us together
"Each one of us glows differently, "
you say laughingly
but you look most dazzling
Like a comet,
like the rainbow after the storm
You bring light into my heart
Being lost can be the answer
Let's promise we won't cheat
Uh...like a shooting star,we do go ahead.
You're awesome,Old Lady Tsunade!
Kakashi Sensei and Sasukeare all right now!
You can't rejoice yet.
The current situationin the village is serious.
You're right.I have to do my best,
And work hard forthe village as well.
Hey! N-Naruto,where do you think you're going?!
I have to fill my stomach first!
You have no sense of emergency...
Next time: "Tsunade's Warning:inja No More!"
What is that supposed to mean?!Yeah, turn your sadness into kindness, your uniqueness into strength
Even if you get lost, let's start walking
One more time
Are you really happy
when you're always meeting to someone's expectations?
Even if you change to who you really wanna be
Will you always have a great smile?
Dreaming of only "the beginning," I wake up
and someday, I'll live on my own.
Yes, precious things are never in shape
You never know what it is when you get it or lose it
Yeah, turn your sadness into kindness, your uniqueness into strength
Even if you get lost, let's start walking
One more time

The winner is Temari.
Oh, I'm tired...
Oh, what a waste!
Why?! He had a chance tobecome a Chunin!
Shikamaru is Shikamaru...
Really... Does he or doesn't hehave the motivation?
Even I'm not sure about it.
But his intelligence and strategiesare no longer at the Genin level.
If it had been an actual missionfor a basic platoon,
the win was decided whenhe captured Temari...
So, I suppose he won the competition,but he lost the match...
It's unfortunate he shows nosigns of being motivated,
on the other hand, he won't get tooemotional or fall into a panic.
And that's exactly why...
he'd be able to calmly pull back ifhe viewed a situation as totally hopeless.
That could be attributed tocalm judgment.
Shikamaru probably possesses...
the most important psychologicalelement required for a Chunin...
the disposition of a leader!
In order to evaluate someoneas a leader of a platoon...
it's much more important toprotect the platoon from danger,
than to carry out a mission.
Yeah... it'd hardly be worth mentioninga completed mission
if everyone was annihilated.
The risks and the missionshould be put on a scale,
surviving should be thought of first,and then action should be taken.
A person who can't do this isn'tqualified to become a Chunin.
Hyuga and Naruto from earlierfail on that point.
Although they are all rightas insignificant Genin.
Well, I do feel like Shikamarugave up too soon too.
What do you think?
What do I feel...?
He has more of a chancethan Naruto, for sure!
Shoot...!
Why the heck did he give up!
Is he an idiot?!
This ticks me off!
I'm gonna really give hima lecture!
So the one that's gonnabecome a Chunin is...
You idiot!
Shut up, super idiot!
Why the heck did you give up?!
Let's not talk about that anymore,all right?
It's not all right! It was a matchyou were close to winning!
- Let's just watch the next match.- But you just gave up! Unimaginable!
Simply unimaginable!
Huh? The next match?
Sasuke...!
"Dancing Leaf, Squirming Sand"
At last, Uchiha's match is next.
Oh, but who's this opponent Gaara?
I wonder...
But com pared to Uchiha,he's nothing much.
Do you know?
I hear Uchiha's gonnawithdraw from this match.
Really?!
Yeah, he apparently sustained a seriousinjury while training before the match...
Are you serious?
And to think I took time offspecifically to see this match!
I'm counting on you, come on!
As you'd expect, this matchwill be won by Uchiha.
No way, I've got high hopefor the new one of the Sand.
He won't let this one slip by.
As they say about the worldof competition...
It's impossible to predictwhat will occur...
Lord Hokage, about Uchiha Sasuke,
he has not yet arrived at the arena.
Umm... it's unavoidable...
We can't make the guestswait any longer.
Another ten minutes.
Why don't we wait justanother ten minutes?
But...
The guests are looking forwardto the next match above all else.
Canceling it would be cruel.
Since it's come to this,waiting another ten minutes wouldn't hurt.
Lord Hokage...?
Umm...
Uchiha, where are you!
What's keeping you?Hurry up!
There is some truth to whatKazekage says.
So shall we extend it forten minutes from now.
So... let Genma know of this.
Yes!
If it stays like this, Uchiha will reallybe forced to withdraw.
I see...a ten-minute extension...
Sasuke...
Hey, isn't that...
Y-You are...
But, what's that idiot doing!He's still not here?!
Sasuke...!
Please!
Good of the two of you to make it!
Come now, hurry into the arena!
Yeah!
All right! Here we go!
Oh! Yeah!
Most of the first round is finished,
and the only one left isSasuke Uchiha and Gaara.
H-How about Naruto andeji's match...?!
Well, the interesting thing is...
That Hyuga lost...
Naruto beat Neji...
I see...
You did it!
Naruto!
You're such a...good guy really...
- What's going on with the next match!- Let's get on with it!
Isn't Uchiha up yet?!
We want Uchiha! Uchiha!
Uchiha!
Hey, it's almost time.
Is he really gonna come?!
He'll come...
He'll definitely come!
Oh Sasuke, what's he doing!
What the heck is Uchiha doing?!
It seems the rumor thathe'd had a serious injury was true.
If there's a win by default,then this match is mine.
Thirty more seconds...
Uchiha!
Uchiha!
Sasuke...please come!
Sasuke!
Hurry up and come!
It won't be good if it stays this way!
The time limit is up.
So this is it.
Because the time limit has expired,the last match...
See... Here he is...
Well, I'm sorry we're late...
Sasu...
Your name?
Sasuke... Uchiha.
Sasuke... Uchiha.
Sasuke!
It looks like he made it in time.
Lee!
Darn... Causing othersthis much trouble...
and thinking himself so important!
Huh! You're pretty late!
I thought you weren't coming'cause you were scared to take me on!
Who the heck was it thatsaid he'd come for sure?
The first round...did you win?
Of course!
Don't get too carried away...
Loser!
Well, I know it's somewhat rudeto be showing up all flashy like this...
but was Sasuke...
disqualified?
So your habit of tardinessrubbed off on him? Cripes...
And...what about it?
It's all right, Sasuke's matchhas been postponed anyway.
Your arrival was barely in time, but...
he hasn't been disqualified.
That's good to hear!
Don't lose to a guy like that!
Yeah...
I want to fight you too...
Sasuke!
I want... to fight you too!
Yeah...
Yay, Sasuke!
Uchiha's match is gonna start!
Shikamaru gave it so much,but already it's Sasuke...
Poor Shikamaru...
Hey, is that Uchiha?
I'm just second fiddle...
Well, I guess that's justthe way it goes...
I'm looking forward to it too.
Your team is sort of amazing, Sakura.
What is?
Well, Naruto did beat thateji Hyuga and...
Sasuke is an elite memberof the Uchiha...
and it seems like everyone'sanxious to see Sasuke's match.
Sasuke will face that Gaaraof the Sand whom I couldn't beat...
And Naruto beat that Nejithat I had hoped to take down.
Why is it so...
Why am I so...
frustrated!
Lee...!
At last...
Gaara, come down here!
Naruto! Let's go up!
Yeah!
When we go up,we'll leisurely take the stairs.
What's up with you!
Are you still upset thatI pushed you down?!
T-This isn't good...
It's been quite awhilesince I've seen Gaara like this.
H-Hey... Gaara.
Keep the strategy in mind--!
Don't talk to Gaara right now!
You'll be killed.
Right!
Let's go!
Hey, hurry up!
Nothing good's gonna happenin your life if you panic.
What's wrong?
Huh?
Low-level tournaments like thisChunin Examination are ideal
as gambling matches.
A number of feudal lordsare here for that purpose.
So...would you lose this match for us.
Hey, come on,at least give us an answer.
Too scared to say anything...
H-Help!
S-Stop! Stop!
If those two in front of ushadn't been there,
we probably would've been killed...
This is the first I've seen anyonekill people without hesitation like that...
This isn't looking goodeven for Sasuke.
Sasuke...
So now... at last...
Everyone makes mistakesIt's nothing to be ashamed about
Don't let this scar be for naughtWalk with a smile
Yes, breathe in the airLift your face to the sky and jump
If it rains, take a breakGo where the wind takes you
So many regretsDon't let this scar be for naught
Let's go carve the badgesin our chest
Yes, it's Show Time,life begins now.
Everyone makes mistakesIt's nothing to be ashamed about
Don't let this scar be for naughtWalk with a smile
Transform sadness into the windand continue to forge on
Forge on strong
Darn it!What kind of guy is that?!
Gaara is totally not normal!He doesn't even look at us.
If anyone fights with him like that...
Darn! Hey Shikamaru!We've got to go see Kakashi Sensei!
We've got to stop this fight,no matter what!
Next time, "Bushy Brow's Jutsu:Sasuke Style!"
If nothing's done,Sasuke's a goner!Yeah, turn your sadness into kindness, your uniqueness into strength
Even if you get lost, let's start walking
One more time
Are you really happy

Release the Genjutsu andwake up Naruto and Shikamaru.
He'll be getting a missionafter such a long while.
What do you mean by a mission?
Be careful...
It's the first A-Ranked missionsince the Land of the Waves.
Ouch!
You were able to releasethe Genjutsu too!
Why were you pretendingto be asleep?!
T rack down Sasuke,join up and then stop him!
Then await next ordersin a safe place.
Huh? Did something happen to Sasuke?!
I'll tell you the reason en route!
Let's go!
H-Hey!
I get it! So that's what happened!
That Sasuke, getting all impatient!
So, why am I pulled into this?This is such a drag!
It can't be helped!
It's Kakashi Sensei's order.
This way!
How long will it be untilwe catch up?
I don't know.He is moving at a pretty good speed.
Dang it!
A Shirker's Call to Action:Layabout No More!
Hey! Hurry it up, you guys.
Huh? What is it?
Did you find Sasuke?
No!
There are eight people intwo squads behind us...
No...
There's one more...There are nine people following us.
What?!
C'mon. Already?!Give me a break!
It looks they haven't graspedour location, yet.
We must lose them.
Hey, what's the point of stopping?!
Shut up and follow me!
Huh?
We're going back over our footprints.
If we do that,
it'll look to them like our footprintssuddenly disappeared.
But, they'll notice evenif we do this, right?
It'll buy us some time.That's enough.
It'll be a matter for great celebrationif our pursuers get impatient,
cloud their eyes of pursuitand lose sight of the trail.
Hurry!
There's no time.
I-I know!
This is not good.
Though they're onalert for ambushes,
they're catching up with usslowly, but surely.
Dang it!
Probably they're all Chunin or higher.
We'll be wiped out if they catch up.
Wiped out...
Dang it! Since it's come to this,why don't we ambush them?!
Ambush?
Right.
Indeed, an ambush wouldbe to our advantage.
Even if the opponent has twicethe people than we do,
if we just catch them off-guard...
That's no good.
Our opponents are formerLeaf Shinobi Orochimaru's henchmen.
In the worst case scenario,there might be Jonin.
I thought it'd work,but I guess not, huh.
Hold it. Why?
The level of opponent doesn't havemuch to do with an ambush.
What do you mean?
You guys don't get it.
Listen. Indeed, an ambush isa very advantageous fundamental tactic.
But two conditions are necessary.
What are those necessary conditions?
Number one.
The ones on the run must act withoutmaking noise and find the enemy first.
Number two.
One must be able to catchthe pursuers off guard,
capture a point and positionto be able to inflict certain damage,
and conceal oneself quickly.
Ah... Huh?
An ambush only becomes effectivewhen these two conditions are ensured.
Well, the first conditionwon't be so difficult
since we have the Ninja Hound's nose.
And the second one alsoseems advantageous at a glance
since we know the geographyof our village.
But Orochimaru has spent timein the Leaf before.
That approach won't workon his henchmen.
So what do you really mean?
Our pursuers must have been instructedin the terrain of this village
and have gone throughsimulated practice for this fight.
And on top of that,
they're probably all Ninjawho have mastered the pursuit arts.
So they know what cards we have, huh.
Well, even so, the fact remainsthat an ambush is advantageous.
But there are too many elementsof uncertainty.
In the first place, the enemy isa special unit organized for this operation.
But we have a fool...
a Kunoichi who's nothing special...
and one dog...
and, me with the number-one cold feet!
A tactic is grasping the conditionsthat are there without fail
and formulating an optimal plan.
And so, there's only one thingthat we can do now...
One?
A diversion in the guiseof an ambush.
One person will remain,pretend to ambush,
and delay the pursuers.
In other words...
bait.
Right. If we delay them,
they won't be able to graspthe positions of the remaining three.
If we do that, we'll be ableto shake off our pursuers,
but the one who has becomethe bait will probably...
die.
So, who's going to do it?
We need the dog to follow Sasuke.
That means...
Fine...
- I'll...- I guess it has to be me.
Shikamaru?!
W-Why you?!
It's better than being wiped out, right?
Besides, among us,
the only one who is equalto playing the bait
and who has the possibilityof surviving...
is me.
Shadow Possession Jutsu is an Artoriginally intended as a delay tactic, so...
Well, I'll catch up later!
Now get going!
We're counting on you, Shikamaru!
Sakura!
Yeah.
Was Shikamaru ever this reliableof a character?
Be careful...
Shikamaru.
No matter how much you try to erasethe signs of your presence...
you're in plain view.
Hey! The enemy is approaching fast.
What did you say?!
I wonder if he's reallydelaying the enemy.
Me with the number-one cold feet!
Don't tell me, Shikamaru...
Shikamaru will be okay!
Don't tell me, he ran away.
I said he'll be okay!
What'll be okay?!
He has a dirty mouth andalways says stuff is a pain.
But he wouldn't betray us!
He hardly ever sayshe'll do something himself,
but he makes sure to do itif he says it!
That's absolute.
I want to believe...I want to believe, but...
Pick up the pace!
I somehow managed toget away completely.
Their strides are irregular.
Urgency is probably increasingtheir fatigue.
Sorry about that.
I was supposed to be the guywith the number one cold feet.
It seems my character haschanged just a bit this time.
The fact that I'm tired is true.
Those footprints are wrong.
By the way, this is whatthe dog's paw print really is.
Oh, he's still a kid.
To think we'd all get caught like this.
So this is the rumored Leaf Village'sShadow Paralysis Jutsu, huh?
That's an old way of saying it!
The times are passing!
It's called Shadow Possession Jutsu now,old man.
Sure enough,that match wasn't good.
I used too much Chakra.I can't hang on much longer...
1, 2, 3, 4...
5, 6, 7...8.
Eight people...
Eight... No, there's one more...
There are nine people following us.
Sure enough, the ninth person's role isto protect against them getting ambushed.
That person stays at a fixed distance,
moves in the back and respondsto an enemy attack.
But...this will make clear wherethat person's hiding!
There, huh?!
Dang it... The Shadow won't reach.
I don't have the stamina tosend it to Chakra.
It's futile. I see through your technique.
Is this as far as it goes?
It looks like you're at your limit...
This Shadow Possession Jutsuis going to break very soon.
Prepare yourself!
I wanted to...become a Ninja any which way,
save up money any which way,
get married any which way toan ordinary woman
who's neither beautiful nor ugly
and have two kids any which way.
First will be a girl, and then a boy...
I would retire from being a Ninjawhen my eldest daughter marries
and my son becomes a full-fledged man.
And then I take it easyin my life of retirement
playing Japanese chessand Go the whole day.
Then I die of old age before my wife.
Such a life would've been nice.
I was out of character,I tried too hard this time.
I wanted it to end in an ordinary way.
What I did was a drag...
Hmm, the movements ofour pursuers have stopped.
Y es! The delaying was a success!
Shikamaru, eh?
I'm sorry I doubted you, even a little.
Okay!
Now...you wait, Sasuke.
And...Shikamaru...
Live, and catch up to us no matter what!
As you say, it seems I'm at my limit.
Hey, come on out.
While you're at it, cut off his head.
I finally caught up.
A-Asuma?! Why?
Well done, Shikamaru.
Sure enough, out of character.
For the time being, you retire here.
Hurry!
What a pest.
The pursuers have increased?Two? No, three?
Kankuro! Pick up the pace!
Okay.
I won't let you get away.
Don't jump the gun, Sasuke.
Sasuke.
Now then, shall we begin?
Everyone makes mistakesIt's nothing to be ashamed about
Don't let this scar be for naughtWalk with a smile
Yes, breathe in the airLift your face to the sky and jump
If it rains, take a breakGo where the wind takes you
So many regretsDon't let this scar be for naught
Let's go carve the badges in our chestYes, it's Show Time, life begins now.
Everyone makes mistakesIt's nothing to be ashamed about
Don't let this scar be for naughtWalk with a smile
Transform sadness into the windand continue to forge on
Forge on strong
I don't know what's going on!
Why is Old Man Hokagefighting with Orochimaru?
Why is Sasuke going afterthat guy with shadows around his eyes?
I don't understand why we haveto go after him,
but that's what we have to do right now!
Wait up, Sasuke!
Next time: "An Unrivaled Match:Hokage Battle Royale!"
What the heck's happeningto the village?!Press down hard on the gas
That's right, there's no compromise
We'll slip through the night
At the final moment push hard
That's right, all the way to zero,
Until we wipe away the days
Gently open your heart
If you pull it close to you
It will reach you, without a doubt
It will come, closer
Now
We're speeding through life,squeezing it for all of its worth
Our feet are tied
But we still keep going farther
Even if I take it back, and grasp it
If you're not the one
There will be no meaning
And so we'll go far off into the distance.

Umm, where's the roomthat Sasuke's in?
Mr. Sasuke is not allowedany visitors.
What?! Hey, hey!What's up with that?!
I'm sorry,those are the rules.
Why, Sis, tell me why?
Naruto, this is a hospital.Keep it down.
Say! Say!I've got a favor to ask!
You don't need to say it all.
Well, I thought it wouldcome to this so...
I searched for someoneto watch your training.
Why?!
I want you to, Kakashi Sensei!
I have some mattersto take care of.
I don't have time totrouble myself with you.
Oh! Aha...!
You're going totrain Sasuke, aren't you?!
Well... don't say that.
I found a sensei who'smore reliable than I am!
Well...who is it?
It's me!
Huh?!
Oh!
You!
The Closet Perv!
Such insolence!
Ebisu Returns:aruto's Toughest T raining Yet!
Ebisu Sensei isa Closet Perv?
Why's this guymy training teacher?!
In the first place,he's weaker than me!
What did you say?
But you see! But you see!
A long time ago,with my Harem Jutsu, this guy...
Transform!
Master Ebisu! Master Ebisu!
B-By any chance...
Harem Jutsu?
U-Uh... it's nothing!
I'll treat you to and buy youwhatever you want later!
Just be quiet about that!
You better.
Wow, I didn't know youwere acquainted.
Well, they're unsavory ties, but.
How could I ever forgetthat humiliation?
But why this guy?
I definitely don't want him to.
Same here.
If it weren't Kakashi's favor,who'd teach you for the fun of it?
Then don't.
Now now, both of you...
Don't say that.
Naruto, Ebisu Sensei is a private tutor
who teaches the elite,a special Jonin!
He's truly betterat teaching than I am.
Well, Naruto, of the three kidsin Squad Seven that I taught,
you're the worst at the basic skills.
Get taught with carethis time around.
How the heck am I inferiorcompared to Sakura and Sasuke?!
Naruto, it's fact that youdon't have the fundamentals down.
No matter what you do,the basic skills are important.
If you really want to become strong,just be quiet and listen to what I say.
Now then, Ebisu Sensei,I'm leaving him with you.
Yes, yes.
Dang it.
It may appear to be harsh,
but you can become strongera lot more.
Do your best.
Okay, then, let's go.
Still, I 'm not convinced...
Huh?
You see!
Fundamentals might be important,
but I won't get strong being taughtby someone weaker than me!
So in other words,you want to say that I'm weak?
Who else is here?!
I was certainly surprised havingthat indecent Jutsu used on me that time.
But it's premature for you tojudge my ability on just that.
Even though you weretotally knocked out.
Fine.
Then, why don't we putit to the test?
Hmm?
Naruto, run.
Huh?
If you can get to outrun me,I'll back down quietly.
Back down...?
Yes.
And of course, I'll speak toKakashi Sensei
about you receiving direct training.
What?! Really?!
This elite instructor does notgo back on his word.
However, this is only ifyou can outrun me.
Then that makes it easy!
See ya!
This'll be a snap, a snap!
I'll lose that...Closet Perv in no time!
He already can't catch up!
I knew I was quitean exceptional Ninja...
Who is exceptional, you say?
Surely you're not thinking you canoutrun me with just that much.
W-What're you saying?!
The chase has still...
only just begun!
Though he's a Closet Perv,
he's the elite tutor after all,he's good.
Now then.
I knew you were Closet Perv.
What are you doing...?
Naruto?
I see. The idea isn't bad.
Then, how about this?!
Shadow Clone Jutsu!
Heh!
Catch me... if you can!
Not bad...
However, you are not the only onewho uses the Shadow Clone Jutsu.
I won't let you get away!
Dang it!
Son... of... a...!
Now then, next.
Hold it!
I found you!
Wait!
I won't let youget away!
Get off!
There!o, actually, here!
Here!
There!
There!
Hold it!
Have you reached your limit?
You're freaking pesky!
Give it up already!
What are you snappingback at me for?
This is a chase, so chasingis natural, right?
T-True enough...
Naruto, you have understoodmy greatness by now, right?
It's about time you surrenderedand moved on to training--
The heck with that!
I'm going to bump you off,and receive Kakashi Sensei's training!
Even if I have to knock you out!
It appears you still havesome spirit left.
To think he would come at mehead on, even though this is a chase.
Just what I would expect of you, Naruto.
As Kakashi said, he's thenumber one unpredictability Ninja.
Don't take this badly!
Eat this!
Clone Jutsu...?
The game is over, Naruto!
Dang it!
Miso-flavor barbecued pork noodles andsalt-flavor ramen noodles!
Here you go!
Naruto, having been shownyour movements and
having further analyzedwhat Kakashi has told me...
it is clear that you cannot controlChakra well.
Control...?
That's right.
Now then, comparing youwith Sasuke and Sakura...
I shall explain yourbad points in order.
As you know, in the case of usinginjutsu, Genjutsu and the like,
Ninjas build up Chakra andactivate the Jutsu.
I-I know that already!
Is that so?
Then, in the case of comparingthe three of you,
I shall explain specificallyhow you are inferior.
That's kind of an irritatingway of saying it.
I'm treating you the ramenas promised,
so be quiet and listen!
First, let us say that Sakurauses Clone Jutsu.
Clone Jutsu!
In her case, her build-up control as well asher control of Chakra is perfect,
so she can make clones withoutusing wasteful energy.
Cha!
Next, in Sasuke's case,
he is somewhat poor atbuilding up Chakra.
Clone Jutsu.
But, his control of Chakra is perfect,
so both he and Sakura canmake five clones.
But, he uses a bit more wastefulChakra than Sakura.
Oh!
So Sasuke's nothing special.
In your case, there's no timeto be laughing at others.
Huh?
You are very poor at building up Chakraand controlling it,
so you cannot make cloneswith the same amount of Chakra.
In the case where you strain tomake clones despite that,
after consuming a much larger amountof Chakra than Sakura and Sasuke...
Clone Jutsu!
...you can barely makeone clone at best.
By the way,
Sakura and Sasuke can become tenwith the same amount of Chakra.
Like this, the three of you arethis different even using the same Jutsu.
Well, this is a somewhat exaggeratedcomparison of you three,
but you build up too much Chakra,use too much physical strength,
and your Jutsu activation is also unstable.
But, there've been times whenI was greater than Sakura and Sasuke...
That's only because youhappen to have
the most outstanding staminaof the three!
Well, I am pretty sure thatyour Chakra control
is getting difficult due to the influenceof the Nine-Tails...
which is the origin of your stamina.
Anyway, there is no mistakingthat you can become strong
if you carry out the trainingwe will be doing from now.
Huh?! Really?!
I guarantee it.
Now then, let's go.
Sir, your bill.
Oh, that's right.
Wha--?!
Thank you very much!
We've come quite a long way...
But, this is a hot spring town, right?
It doesn't look like we've comehere to leisurely soak in a hot spring...
Hey! Naruto!
That's the women's bath!
I simply will not allowindecent behavior!
Huh?
I'm not you...
It's not that I was trying to peep.Believe it!
Thinking of something like thatin the first place makes you a Closet Perv!
What's with that look?
N-Nothing.
More importantly, why've we cometo a place like this?!
Will soaking in a hot springdo anything for training?
No!
The training will be herein this hot spring area!
Okay, this is the place.
It's a bath, sure enough!
What are you saying?
I said this is training, didn't l?Training!
We're going to train here?
What the heck are we going to do?
Walk on this hot water!
What?!
What is it?
Walk on hot water?
Can you really do that?
Of course!
I heard from Kakashi Sensei.
You already did tree-climbing trainingwithout using your hands, right?
It's an application of that.
Hmm...What do you mean?
Besides, I don't really rememberstuff from long ago!
In tree climbing, all you dois accumulate
only the necessary amount of Chakrain one necessary location
and maintain that amount ofChakra all the while.
Trees are fixed objects,so you only need to be attached to it.
In other words,
it's training for building upa fixed amount of Chakra.
To float on the surface of water,
you have to discharge ona constant basis
an appropriate amount of Chakrafrom your feet to the water
and balance that to the extent thatyou can float your own body.
Huh?
This Chakra control ismore difficult than maintaining...
and is a control training fordischarge and usage of fixed amount
of Chakra for Jutsu and alike.
Hmm, I really don't get it!
Well, it would be better toshow you in your case.
First, you build up Chakrain your feet.
Then, while constantly discharginga fixed amount...
you balance it with your body weight.
And...
well, this is how it goes.
Oh! Okay!I'm going to try!
First, you build up Chakrain your feet.
Then!
Discharge a fixed amount. Right?
Oh!
I knew it.
Hot-hot-hot-hot!
I forgot to mention it,but this hot water is 60° C.
If you do nothing but fail...
you will become a boiled octopus!
Dang it!
I'll do it no matter what!
You're unusually spirited today,honored grandson!
My principle of guidancehas finally gotten through!
This would ordinarily be thetime to go carry out
a surprise attack on Lord Hokage.
I've stopped doing that now!
That's right!
So you have finally understood.
That the shortcut to becomingthe Hokage is to do as I say...
There are no shortcuts!
Huh?
Brother Naruto said it...
If you're to become Hokage,be prepared for that!
Oh!
I'm starting to get it!
To think he would get thehang of the Chakra control this quickly...
I never thought,you would grow this much.
Indeed, there are no shortcuts,in anything...
It appears I had thewrong idea about you...
You are a much smarter teacherthan I am.
And, you were not just a Demon Fox...
You were a splendidHidden Leaf Village Ninja!
Oh! Hot!
Hm?! That is...!
Humph! I don't know who you areor where you're from, but...
I will not allow indecency!
Man...
T-That is!
What?!
Don't make a ruckus.
Jeez, it won't do to be found out!
The Closet Perv lost?
W-What's with thatShameless Perv?!
One! First, Tyson jumps and slamdunks
Two! He kisses and hugs everyonerandomly and says "l LOVE YOU"
Three! Masala masters Yogabut hates curry
Four! Sanchez is a lousy bullfighter. Ole!
All over the world, the sky's smiling,so look up and smile too
Oh yeah! Oh yeah! Oh yeah!Fight! Fight! Fight!
One! Bodimahattaya-san devoteshis time for digging black ships
Two! Peking Duck, Action Scene,Chen Lee speeds around on his bike
Three! Popo loves to polish his Coteka
Four! Japanese people,now lend me your hand!
All over the world, the sky's smiling,so look up and smile too
Oh yeah! Oh yeah! Oh yeah!Fight! Fight! Fight!
All over the world, the sky's smiling,so look up and smile too
Oh yeah! Oh yeah! Oh yeah!Fight! Fight! Fight!
Hey, hey, hey, hey, you!
What're you doing,Shameless Perv?!
Here I was having my training watched,and you did this to the Closet Perv!
And you're so infernallyquick at running away.
Could he be a super Ninja?
Next episode."Long Time No See: Jiraiya Returns!"
I'll chase him down and make himtrain me without fail!
All over the world, the sky's smiling,so look up and smile too
Oh yeah! Oh yeah!Press down hard on the gas
That's right, there's no compromise
We'll slip through the night
At the final moment push hard
That's right, all the way to zero,
Until we wipe away the days
Gently open your heart
If you pull it close to you
It will reach you, without a doubt
It will come, closer
Now
We're speeding through life,squeezing it for all of its worth
Our feet are tied
But we still keep going farther
Even if I take it back, and grasp it
If you're not the one
There will be no meaning
And so we'll go far off into the distance.

Ugh...what are you here for now?
It's our reunion after so long,and you're awfully cold.
Don't tell me that you came toassassinate Lord Hokage?
No, no...
I don't have enoughsubordinates for that yet...
I've heard of the excellence onesof this village
and thought I’d put dibs on them.
A little while ago, I gave thatsame Curse Mark as a present.
There's a kid that I want.
Selfish as always.
That kid will die.
Certainly...
The odds are 1 in 10that he'll survive,
but he may survive just like you did.
This kid, you really like him, huh?
Are you jealous?
Are you still holding a grudge thatI used you and threw you away?
Unlike you, that kid will excel...
For one thing, he inheritedthe Uchiha ability.
He has beautiful features
and is a vessel whocan become my heir.
If that kid lived,it makes things interesting.
Be sure not to cancel this test.
Three from my village are alsounder your care...
Make me enjoy it.
If something happensto deprive me of my fun,
consider it the end of Leaf Village.
We've secured food and waterafter spending half a day.
And now most teams have halted activity.
As we planned,this is the time that we attack.
We'll split up into threeand go scouting.
However, whether we findother teams or not,
we return to this place.
Got it?
Okay.
Roger.
Okay. Scatter!
Bushy-Brow's Pledge:Undying Love and Protection!
I can't fall asleep...
I need to protect these two.
I slept great!
Naruto!
Sasuke!
Did you take care of us?
Thank you, Sakura!
We're totally better because of you!
That's good...
A prey must always stay tenseand flee desperately
in front of the predator!
My voice is gone!
It was just a dream...
Is it daybreak already?!
No, no way!
A squirrel?
Don't surprise me like that!
Oh!
That was too close.
Do you think she noticed?
The Paper Bomb we put on the squirrel...
No, that's not it.
Huh? Then what? What was it?
We'll probably find out if we go closer.
So...we should get going now.
If I can catch all twenty of these leavesbefore they hit the ground
Sakura will start to like me.
If...if I can't catcheven one of the leaves...!
It'll be an unanswered love forever.Or rather...
You're too Bushy!
That's what she'll say.
One, two, three, four...five, six, seven, eight...
nine, ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen, fourteen,fifteen, sixteen, seventeen, eighteen,
nine--!Ugh, nineteen...
One more!
That's...!
Phew...just in time.
This is called a Paper Bomband it explodes after some time.
Who did such an awful thing?
Stop hiding and come out.
Shoot! We scrambled to hide, you know?!
Man, he's a damn painand we've been discovered!
Strategy One, "hide and let it pass,"was a failure!
So now we carry out Strategy Two!
Huh? Are you serious?
What? You have a problem with that?
There's no question of success.
Well, I guess it's all right but...
Wow! To meet last year's Number Onerookie, Neji Hyuga, in a place like this!
C-Can I have your autograph?
So it's just you guys?
Take that! Strategy Two, "head over healsinfatuation with my sex appeal"!
I'd been wanting to meet youfor some time, you know?
Get lost!
Why? Why doesn't my sexiness work?!
Shoot, it ticks me off, darn!
Did you just raise your fists to me,and does that mean you want to fight?
N-No...Of course not.
Then get lost.
Stealing a scroll from cowardly wimpslike you
would only make methe laughing stock of the village.
Y-Yes!
Huh... Really just like cockroaches.
Just as I thought.
A fellow like that wouldn't takea scroll away from wimps like us
unless we were to turn on him.
All right! Let's go find some wimps!
Like I've been sayingthere's no one wimpier than us...
So a no-sleep lookout?
But it's not necessary anymore.
Wake Sasuke up.We want to battle with him.
Y-You bastards...
What're you saying?
What is it you're after?
I know the one called Orochimaruis calling the shots from the shadows!
Huh?!
What's that strange bruise onthe back of Sasuke's neck?
You did this to Sasuke.
How can you say you want to fight him?!
I wonder...what he has on his mind?
However, I can't stay quietafter hearing that.
I will kill this girl,I'll also kill this Sasuke character.
Wait, Zaku.
Huh? What is it?
It's so cliche.
It's the color of dirtthat's just been dug up.
This grass, it doesn't grow ina place like this, does it?
Darn!
You know, with a trap...
there's no point unless youmake it so it's not discovered.
Huh, how ridiculous!
So that Kunai knife was so the squirrelwouldn't be caught in the trap?
We kill her now!
A log?!
A trap above too? Watch out!
Just kidding.
What?!
Clearly you have no talent.
Someone like you needs tomake more of an effort or else!
Leaf Hurricanes!
What?! This guy...
Then you also should...make an effort!
Who are you?
I'm the beautiful blue beastof Leaf Village, Rock Lee!
Why are you here?
I will always appear...
whenever you're in trouble!
Or should I say...
It was really because of you,now run along.
But right now, I'm alsoyour enemy!
I did say this once before, didn't l?
That I'll protect you until I die.
Please go out with me!
I'll protect you until I die!
Oh...
T-Thanks.
Yes!
Perfect! I did it!Gu Sensei, that was perfect!
I guess it can't be helped...
Zaku. I'll give you Sasuke.
I will kill them!
As far as I can tell,Sakura is in no condition to fight.
That Bushy-Brow guy ispretty proficient with Taijutsu...
Looks like I can have some fun!
There is a trick to your attack, isn't there?
I won't just simply avoid it.
You showed me your Jutsu before.
This guy...he's strong.
Having said that,
the odds aren't good sinceit's one versus three.
I'm gonna have to take a chance.
One person at a time...
I'll give it my all and take each down!
There's no one at all that seems wimpy!
Well, the only team that's weakerthan us is the Naruto team.
Idiot! You know what you're saying?
What?!
No question Naruto and Sakura are lame!
But that team hasthe super genius Sasuke!
Hah! I wonder...
In actual battle that geniusmight easily be beaten.
What?!
All right, all right,I apologize for irritating you.
What a pain...
I say one negative thing aboutSasuke and I get the evil eye, every time...
There's no way Sasukecould be taken down!
Sakura's a different matter though!
Huh?!
Hey! Sasuke has collapsed...
Huh?!
...and Sakura is fighting.
What did you say?
Hey!
He's late.
That Lee...
Something's not right.
He's always precise about time.
Perhaps he ran into the enemy...
Could it be...?
Huh, that wouldn't have happened.
In any case, let's find Lee!
Right!
Yes! I've finally mastered it!Yes! Yes!
My friends, there's no reasonto give up on your youth!
This Jutsu...
In the end, only Leecould make it his own.
Yahoo!
- Hey Lee...- I did it! I will do it!
- Lee!- When I try! I try!
Hey, Lee!
Hey!
Listen to this passionate messagefrom your teacher!
Oh...what is it?!
Please tell me using hip words.
This Jutsu, the "Lotus"...
it will be dealt with henceforthas a forbidden Jutsu.
- What?!- Huh?!
W-What do you mean?
This Jutsu poses a great burdenon the cells of the muscles,
it's a kind of "Self-sacrificing Technique."
Humans normally utilize,at most, 20 percent...
of the "power" that the muscles have.
Do you understand?Only 20 percent!
And if nearly 100 percentof the "power" is used
the muscles themselves will disintegrate.
So, the brain usually controls the "power."
However, this Jutsu forces thebrain's limiter to go off by using Chakra,
allowing high speed continuous Taijutsu...
In other words, this is a dangerous Jutsuwhich relies on a secret technique
that brings forth "power" almostto the limit of one's body.
So the only time it is all rightto use this Jutsu
is when a certain condition is met...
So...when is that?
Are you ready?
Take this to heart...
The condition is...
The condition is...
Guy Sensei...
I will utilize that Jutsu without reserve.
Because this is the time you said..
"When protecting a precious person!"
He disappeared?!
It's just the beginning.
Oh, oh no!
There's no way he can break his fall!
Take this!
Primary Lotus!
This feeling...
Well well...
Just in time.
T-That's impossible!
That is a frightening Jutsu...
It did this much even thoughI fell on the spongy dirt.
It's now my turn.
Oh no! With what I just did...
my body still isn't...
Lee!
Your Jutsu is indeed fast.
But our Jutsu exceeds thatand is the speed of sound!
I'll show you there are walls
which effort alone cannever break through.
Hey, can you hear it?
The clear, blue sky goes on and on
The ocean spans limitlessly
Please keep that smile on your face forever
Or else I'll cry
You won't have to search around you
It's all ok now.
Everyone is insidethis hand
when you want to cry, and you want to run away
When you forget what happiness is
Just sing.
Light is born, and darkness was born
The two are one
Harmonia, feel the telepathy
Hey, can you hear it?
I'm so frustrated!I'm just pulling feet again.
I'm always just being protected.I always just watch them from behind.
This time, I need to protect everyone!
Naruto, Sakuke, Lee!
I want to be like you too!
Next episode:"Sakura Blossoms!"
Please watch my battle...Press down hard on the gas
That's right, there's no compromise
We'll slip through the night
At the final moment push hard
That's right, all the way to zero,
Until we wipe away the days
Gently open your heart

Hey you, failure.
I have two piecesof advice for you.
First, if you intend to callyourself a Shinobi,
stop that revolting cheering of yours.
And second...
a failure willalways be a failure.
There's no changing that!
Do you want to see about that?
You!
Naruto, I get where you'recoming from, believe me.
But all fighting must be doneofficially in a match!
The failure beats the gifted geniusthrough sheer effort...
Wouldn't that make foran exciting main battle?
I promise you.
I will win no matter what!
Gaara vs. Rock Lee:The Power of Youth Explodes!
Hey, Choji!
You're in trouble.
Only the strong ones are left.
Probably the strongest of Hidden Soundmust be that bloke.
And Lee is apparently strongenough to take on Sasuke!
And particularly that Sand guy!
He's probablythe most dangerous one!
I-I don't care!
I plan to forfeit right awayif that happens...
So that means...
Huh?
...you plan to foregoall-you-can-eat BBQ, too, then.
What? Come on!
Don't worry.
If things start getting ugly,
I'll step in and stop the fight,like I did for Hinata. Okay?
Prime beef tongue, short ribs...
- You can eat what you want.- Don't dangle food in front of him!
- Besides he didn't step in...- You can eat whatever you want...
- and stop the fight for Hinata.- and all you want.
B-B-Q! All right, B-B-Q!All you can eat!
He doesn't look good.
Watching the previous fight...
Did it get stirred up?
His inner demon!
I'm curious about that guy, Neji, too...
Here's a plan.
Kankuro?
Just a littleinformation-gathering mission.
Hey!
Huh?
What are you doing hereall by yourself?
Shouldn't you be with your friends?
I-It's none of your business, is it?!
Hmmm. Well, well...
That guy...Neji Hyuga, right?
Well, it seems to me that
he didn't reveal the true extentof his power in that last match.
What's he about?
I'm going to crush him!
Err, that's not whatI was asking.
Besides, this guy's way out of his league...
You seem like a fun guy.I quite like you.
You're dull.And I don't like you at all!
I'm going to waste this guy!
We will now resume the battle.
Okay!
You'll be up this time for sure.Go for it, Lee!
No!
- Huh?- What?
Seeing as I've come this far,I rather be the last!
Is Lee sulking?
Hurry up and get down here...
Safe!
- Hey!- Don't do anything misleading, idiot!
Gaara vs. Rock Lee
Oh! Lee!
It worked!
If you say you want to go last,then you won't be last.
It's an application of the same law
that says a stone thrown to hita telephone pole will miss,
and a stone thrown to misswill be a direct hit!
Right! That's my student!
I absolutely did notwant to go last!
I threw them a beauty of a curve!
Threw whom a curve?
Okay, so let me give youa little piece of "nice" advice.
Right!
Probably no one has noticed yet, but...
That gourd is suspicious!
I see!
Quit with the notes!
You're not going to have time toread them during the match! Fool!
I see!
He didn't realize that?
Wow, is Lee going to be all right?
All right!Go! Lee!
Yeah!
I am very happy to be squaringoff with you so early in the match.
I don't know what kind of movesthat bowl-cut guy has,
but he will never take Gaara.
Never!
He's fast, to be sure,but his kick is not all that great.
No...
He's...strong!
Please don't be in such a hurry.
Lee...
Be careful, Lee.
Now then... The 9th match...
Begin!
Leaf Hurricane!
Is that...?
Sand?
What an unusual Jutsu...
There's sand in his gourd!
That's...
That's it?
Desert Coffin!
Desert Burial!
Not another horror story like that...
A sand-manipulating Jutsu, eh?
Sounds like trouble.
But let's give it a go!
Even that Lee's fast strikes...
have no effect at all!
What's the deal?!
No physical strike is going tohave any effect on him.
What?
The Sand shields and protects Gaara
on its own accord, independentlyof any intent on Gaara's part.
That's why...no one has been ableto do it so far....
Injure Gaara, that is.
Curses! He's not movinga muscle and still...!
Is that it?
Entertain me a bit more...
There's not enough yet!
Blood!
Why is Lee only using Taijutsu?
He'll never be able to get closeenough for that!
Why doesn't he step back a bit anduse Ninjutsu or something?
It's not that he doesn't use it.
He can't use it.
Huh?
Lee has almost no Ninjutsuor Genjutsu skills.
N-No way!
When I first met Lee,he was completely inept.
He had no talent whatsoever.
What? I can't believe that!
Hey hey!
Certainly...
A ninja who can't do Ninjutsuand Genjutsu is a rarity.
That's why, the only path open to Leeas a Ninja was Taijutsu.
But! That's precisely whatmakes him a winner!
Huh?
Lee, take them off!
B-But Guy Sensei...!
You told me only to do that
to protect a large groupof very important people!
That's quite all right!
I give you permission!
Are those...?
Weights?
That's some cliche training...
I see!
Ridiculous!
All right, now I canmove easily!
Humph! Does he thinkremoving some measly little weights
is going to enable him tooutmaneuver Gaara's sand...?
A bit extreme, I'd say, Guy.
Go, Lee!
Right!
Go!
Very close!
Fast!
Amazing...!
Because he can't useinjutsu or Genjutsu...
Therefore, he channeled allof his time,
all of his energy and...
all of his being into Taijutsu.
Though he can't do any other Jutsu...
He won't lose to anyone...
He is a Taijutsu specialist!
I can't believe it!Gaara 's been injured!
No way...!
Bushy-Brows is evenfaster than before!
Was he this strong?!
Youth is...explosion!
Right!
Over here!
Good!
I got him good!
A-Amazing, he's so fast!
The Sand Shield can't keepup with him!
A direct hit!
A-Amazing.
His strikes are lightning fast...!
I can't even track himwith my eyes!
Uh oh...
Uh oh is right!
That black-circles-under-the-eyeguy is taking some serious blows!
That's not what I meant.
Huh?
W-What the...?!
His face is crumbling right off...!
His whole body is coveredwith sand....
There's not a scratch on him!
W-What's with this guy?!
Sure enough, he wasencased in sand, eh.
But, it's been a long time since
I've seen that expressionon Gaara 's face.
I felt that he was becomingmore and more unstable
as the Chunin Exam progressed...
So Gaara 's other self hasbeen awakened, eh?
Hey! What is that?
That protected himagainst Bushy-Brow's strikes?
Yes... It's Sand Armor.
Armor?
Ordinarily, the Sand Shieldfunctions to protect him automatically,
but, if by chance,the Shield is penetrated,
the Sand Armor functions as a secondlayer of protection against strikes...
That's Gaara's... absolute defense!
Well then, there's no wayto get him!
He doesn't have any weak points.
No. That's not entirely true...
The Sand Armor is actuallyriddled with weak points.
First of all, because it's not automatic,it uses up a lot of Chakra.
It's also less effectivethan the Sand Shield,
and it takes an enormous amountof physical energy
to keep the sand clingingto the body like that.
Gaara 's having to use the armor...is proof that he's under pressure.
That Lee is really good...
But, the outcome of the matchis already a given.
He will never beat Gaara!
Is that all?
But what an incredibledefense he has...
no amount of speed is goingto let me get a strike through.
I'll have to do major damagefrom above the sand guard.
That will be Lotus!
Yes.
Be ready!
A thin sand guard like thatwill be inconsequential
in the face of Lee's high-speedLotus slamming down from above.
Hurry up and bring it on!
You asked for it!
He didn't float.
Not just yet!
What an amazing series of kicks!
Even an ordinary Lotus hasa tremendous strain on the body...!
Lee, let this be the finishing blow!
Take this!
Primary Lotus!
I got him...
good!
Right on!
I-It's over!
W-What? This can't be!
He did it! Lee's won!
Hey, he isn't dead, is he?
Wha--?!
Huh?!
What?!
Hey, can you hear it?
The clear, blue sky goes on and on
The ocean spans limitlessly
Please keep that smile on your face forever
Or else I'll cry
You won't have to search around you
It's all ok now.
Everyone is insidethis hand
when you want to cry,and you want to run away
When you forget what happiness is
Just sing.
Light is born, and darkness was born
The two are one
Harmonia, feel the telepathy
Hey, can you hear it?
Hey, what happened, Bushy-Brows?!
All of your strength seemsto have disappeared!
You're going to be destroyedat this rate!
But, hey, Bushy-Brows is smiling!
How can he continue to keep upa fighting stance
when he's being routed like this?!
Next episode: "Lee's Hidden Strength:Forbidden Secret Jutsu!"
The expression in Bushy-Brows' eyeshas changed!Yeah, turn your sadness into kindness, your uniqueness into strength
Even if you get lost, let's start walking
One more time
Are you really happy
when you're always meeting to someone's expectations?
Even if you change to who you really wanna be
Will you always have a great smile?
Dreaming of only "the beginning," I wake up
and someday, I'll live on my own.
Yes, precious things are never in shape
You never know what it is when you get it or lose it
Yeah, turn your sadness into kindness, your uniqueness into strength
Even if you get lost, let's start walking
One more time

Summoning Jutsu!
This time for sure, the frog will...
What's a frog anyway?!
From which stage do youcall it a frog?!
Live or Die:Risk it All to Win it All!
Hey! Hold up a hopeon me a bit, would you?!
Whew... he collapsed again...
That's no surprise...
For three weeks, he's continuedhis training on guts alone...
Lord Hokage.
Anko, is it...?
I'm sorry, I'm...
Regretting returning alivefrom the Forest of Death?
That's a needless thing because you andOrochimaru have no connection at all.
There is no Shinobi who can competeagainst that guy in Hidden Leaf Village.
Even if I was the one to face him...
If the Fourth Hokage were still alive...
Don't say that.
He already saved this village and died...
That's a story from 13 years ago.He's no longer here.
We have to do somethingwith our power.
Yes.
I'm going to get some fresh air...
Don't blame yourself.
C'mon, open your eyes already.
W-What's that...?
To be clear, you have no sense.
Oh! Pervy Sage!
After you've been training for 3 weeks,you are still this level.
If you continue like this it's pointless.
That's not how it is!I'm doing this with all my might!
I understand that, if you really wantto succeed at Summoning Jutsu,
you have to do it like you're goingto die or it's no good at all.
That's what I'm doing!
I drill my Chakra every daylike I'm going to die.
If you have time to complain about it,teach me a trick or something!
A trick, huh... A trick.
What?! You're going to teach me?
You need to risk your life on it.
L-Life...?
It's not a joke.Even so, will you do it?
O-Of course!I always risk my life!
I see...
Huh...?
Well then, follow me.
What are we doing at a place like this?
You're not gonna peek again,are you?
Well, that would be nice,but today it's a bath.
First, we purify our bodies...
Huh?
There's something strange going on...
This is such a nice bath.
Like heaven... Truly heavenly...
Hey, Pervy Sage.
I'm Toad Sage.
Whatever, but how are takinga bath and Summoning related?
Hey, hey, hey, hey--!
What is it?!
Hey, Naruto.
Huh?
Is there something you want to eat?
I'm going to eat!
It's good! If the training is like this,I'll do it every day!
Eat up! Because this is the last...
Huh?
No, nothing. Anyway, eat!Eat a lot!
Like there's no looking back!
I don't know what's going on,but I should eat, right? Okay!
Seconds! The next one is miso flavor too!
Gotcha!
One more!
Coming right up!
This time miso char siu!
Yeah!
I ate, I ate.
Thank you, Pervy Sage...
What?!
Thanks for your patronage!
I won't even get blood from it...
Yo, are you full?
Don't mess with me, Pervy Sage!
Weren't you treating mewith the meal!
Fool! Who said thatI was treating you?!
Aren't you a grown-up?! Bastard!
By the by, Naruto,isn't there a girl that you like?
Huh?
I asked if you have a lovely girl?
Well...you could say she's there,you could say I like her...
You could say it's Sakura.
So there is?
It's Sakura!
Okay! Then go andhug that girl tight!
What?!
Is that a part of the training?
Well, close enough.
Okay! Right away...
But if I do that, Sakura will...
No! This is training too!I have to do it or I won't be strong...
But if I do that, Sakura will...
For a while she won't talk to me...
No! If I'm going to masterSummoning Jutsu,
this can't be helped!
But...Sakura will...
No! But...
Hurry up and go!
What do you want?
No, uh...well...
If it's money you want,I won't lend it to you.
I may not look it,but I'm stingy with money.
No, that's not it...
Well...
Uh, if I tell her it's for my training,she's sure to beat me.
If there's nothing you want,then I'll go home.
W-Wait a minute!
Oh...
This is it!This is my chance!
Sakura! I'm sorry!
Hey!
What are you doing?!
Cha!
Ow... Ouch...
This is a part of being young...
Hey, if I do this I'll really get a frog?
Yes, that's a definite.
Really...?
Is there anything you've left undone?
Huh?
None?
What are you talking about...?
To pull out enormous Chakraand use it.
It is certain that it is difficultto have the control to do it...
It is also certain that this bodyis a vessel too small
to absorb the Nine-Tailed Fox Chakra...
It's likely that Naruto's body normallytends to reject
the strength of the Nine-Tailed Foxin order to avoid too much strain.
If the excitement of danger andemotion are the key
to drawing out theine-Tailed Fox's Chakra...
he has to learn physically untilhe can automatically use that key.
Nothing personal...Fourth Hokage!
Huh? Where...is this...?
Stand up!
W-What's going on?!
Your training ends here.
Huh? I haven't done anything yet...!
Naruto!
Go die and come back.
Die?
From within the dreadfulness of death,squeeze out enormous Chakra!
Experience it with your own body,and grasp the technique of it!
If you don't want to die,do something about it yourself... Got it?
Now...we'll see if the strength givento you is really yours.
If I don't grab onto this... I'll die!
Now!
It's impossible...
This rock surface is slipperyfrom the seepage of the waterfall.
Besides, falling in that speedwith the control of Chakra that you have,
you can't cling to the rock.
Naruto, after this...
you can only depend onthe Chakra of the Nine-Tailed Fox.
Open up the key...This time from your side!
If I go on like this!If I go on like this! I'll seriously die!
Die!
Die...
Today, we'll havea history lesson outside.
As you know, this rock face hasthe faces of the Hokage line.
In order from the left,they're lined up from the First,
the Second...the Third... and the Fourth.
So different from the present old man.
Especially the receding hairline...
Iruka Sensei! Who's the Fifth?
Hmm?
Well, that hasn't been decided yet...
Perhaps it's your teacher here!
Hmm... Weaving an occasional joketo make for a relaxing lesson, Iruka?
L-Lord Hokage!
Oh, it's the Third.
Hey! Old man!What did you come to do?
I wanted to see the rock faces too.
You've come at a good time.Over this way, my lord.
This is the real man ofthe third rock face!
The Third Hokage!
The third was called the strongest,a genius,
called "professor" amongpast Hokage!
- What?!- Huh?!
Hey! Iruka, don't say itin the past tense.
S-Sorry.
Are you really strong?
Yeah, you don't look it!
Yep! That's right!
Enough!
To take over the name of Hokagemeans you're the strongest in this village!
Okay! I'm going to becomethe Fifth Hokage!
After all I'm really strong,and handsome too!
It won't work withthe scores you have now!
You've got a lot of confidence!
You all are quite young,unlike me!
There might be someone who willtake the name of Hokage is in this group.
You only have one life!
Don't choose an impossible road.
It doesn't matter if you live asyou like and die as you like.
However...
no matter what route you take,
remember to protect thepeople important to you!
Important people?
That you acknowledge...trust and love from your heart.
Do you have people like that?
Y-Yeah... Dad and Mom...
and I hate him a little,but my big brother too.
And...my dog Gonta...
For me, it's friends!
Me too!
Lord Hokage, you havepeople like that too?
Yes, of course I do!
Really! Who, who?
I have my grandchild...Konohamaru over there and...
All of the people in this village!
Like you did too, once...
Huh?!
This feeling... It's that Chakra...
This is...
Seal
I-It's huge... What is it?
Hey kid, come closer!
I want to eat and kill you,but this gate won't open...
Bloody spell that seals...
You're...
the Nine-Tailed Fox!
I see... the red Chakrawas this guy's Chakra.
For you to approach me...
What business brought you here?
Hey! You stupid fox!
Since you're staying in my body,as your rent, lend me your Chakra!
After all, if you die I die.
That's some impressive couragefor threatening me!
That's fine...
As a reward for making it this far...I'll give it to you!
This is the feeling!
Summoning Jutsu!
Well done.
Where am l?!
One! First, Tyson jumps and slamdunks
Two! He kisses and hugs everyonerandomly and says "I LOVE YOU"
Three! Masala masters Yogabut hates curry
Four! Sanchez is a lousy bullfighter. Ole!
All over the world, the sky's smiling,so look up and smile too

Yay! This time for sure,I've finally brought out the real toad.
Listen, you giant toad,I am your master from today!
Huh? No, nothing.
I will be your henchman, boss.
I'm so happy...
Next time, "He Flies! He Jumps!He Lurks! Chief Toad Appears!"

Tsunade's Warning:inja No More!
Good work, Akamaru!You nailed it!
Midair Dynamic Marking!
Next, three twists!
Aim carefully!
Can one call that a walk?o, I don't think one can.
I can't gather insects at ease.
It's so great...
that the three of you have thingsyou're good at and that you love...
I hope you'll findsomething like that too, Hinata.
You're right...
And, what is it?
You had somethingto tell me, didn't you?
Umm...
Yeah...
So, using that as a hint,
think about the fastest wayto get to the destination.
Start!
Everyone!
I'm sorry this happens all the time,but class is over for today.
Yippee!
- Why?- Huh? Not again.
The handout is your homework!
- What?!- Huh?!
I'm so happy we didn't havethe class for Taijutsu.
But these days,class either finishes in the morning
or we have the whole day off...
I wonder if that's really okay.
What's up with acting likea serious student?
Right, Konohamaru?
Huh?
Konohamaru?
Konohamaru!
What do you think you're doingwith Grandpa's things?!
Honorable grandson...
Those belong to my Grandpa!
Where are you taking them?!
Uh...you mean these?
They are no longer used,
so I thought I'd put them into storagein a different location.
No longer used, you say...
You think it's okay to take Grandpa'sthings away without permission?!
The Fifth Hokage will be usingthe chambers, you know.
The Fifth Hokage?
Y-Yes.
The next Hokagehas finally been decided.
The village can have peace of mind now.
That person apparentlydoesn't smoke tobacco...
What do you mean, Fifth Hokage?!
It's too soon for that!
When you depended onthe Old Man up to recently!
What a lovely fragrance...
Huh?!
Wh-What are you doing?!
That's exactly my question for you!
You perverted kid...
I dare you to say that again!
Huh? You want meto say it again?
Per-vert-ed kid!
Don't call me that!
Lady Tsunade!
The elders are all waiting,so we had better hurry.
Yes, I know.
Be careful, little boy.
Please be more consciousof your actions.
I'm the personwho has to deal with the complaints...
Okay, okay.
I'm not a little boy!
Who the heck are you?!
That's my question...
Naruto!
Konohamaru?
Long time no see!
Hey, more importantly, have you seena big-boobed, scary old lady...
I mean, young lady?
I did see her!
- Where did she go?!- Who the heck is she?!
Who is she?
She has to goto the hospital straightaway!
Hospital?
That lady may not look it,
but she's an awesomeMedical Corps Ninja!
She finally came back to the villageto become the Hokage, so...
what is she taking her sweet time for?!
Hokage...
The Fifth Hokage.
She better do whatshe promised to do.
You're lying...
Huh?
I don't believe you!
It's a lie!
What?
There are seven birds within 50 metersbehind me in the direction of the "2. "
Tenten...?
Neji!
I just heard that that Lady Tsunadehas returned!
It's the real McCoy.Wanna go see her?
Sorry.
But I'm not interested.
Huh?
So there were...
eight birds, huh...
Listen carefully, Tsunade.
We must call the feudal lords
and announce the fact thatthe Fifth Hokage has been chosen.
We will start preparations todayfor the inauguration ceremony in the village.
Feudal lords and ceremoniesare just a big pain.
Tsunade!
Yes, yes, I know...This is also the job of the Hokage.
- Genma!- Here!
- Aoba!- Here!
Issue an official notice and
convey this matter to those in the villagewithin the next few days.
We must introduce the Fifth Hokage.
- Yes, ma'am!- Yes, ma'am!
I hate you, Grandpa!
Why did you have to die?
The Fifth Hokage...
Gimme a break,my shoulders are so stiff.
I wish I could just downa nice cup of hot sake and relax.
Lady Tsunade!
Wait a second!
Before you do that,
you have something else you need to do,Old Lady Tsunade!
What was it?
I told you, didn't l?!
About Kakashi Sensei andSasuke and Bushy Brow!
Oh... right, right.
Hey, if it isn't Naruto!
Huh? Shikamaru?
Why are you in a place like this?
That's my question-
Why are you in a place like this?
I have no idea why,
but my father told meto come along with him.
What's up with that?
Long time no see, Lady Tsunade.
Oh, the kid from the Nara Family, huh.
Are you taking proper careof the deer?
The antlers of the deer fromthat area make very good medicine.
Yes, I'm somehow managing.
Hey, Naruto, who's that person
who acts like sucha big shot when she's so young?
That's apparently the new Hokage.
Huh?!
Despite her appearance,she's an old lady in her fifties.
Yikes!
Well, see you again sometime.
Yes, ma'am.
All right, to the hospital!
See you later, Shikamaru.
I'm will show you an awesomenew technique I learned!
That's the new Fifth Hokage...?
Hey, Shikamaru.
That person is the strongestand most beautiful person in the world.
Huh?
I mean, she's the lone femaleamongst the Legendary Sannin.
Huh... A female Hokage?
I'm not very comfortable with women...
Huh?
Even though they're unusually frank,they always hang around and
you're never quite surewhose side they're on.
They always think they can makemen do whatever they want.
Anyway, they're just a pain.
Hey Shikamaru...
Without women,men wouldn't be born.
If women weren't around,nothing good would come of men.
No matter how hard-edgeda woman might be,
she'll show her gentle sideto the man she loves.
I can't believe that Pa's saying that...
when he's tied to Mom's apron strings.
You'll understand onceyou reach that age.
Oh no!
Let's hurry up andget our business done...
because Mom will chew us outif we're late.
Hurry up, Shikamaru!
Looks like nothing will comeof some men
even if they have a woman.
Konoha Hospital
I'm coming in.
Who are you...?
What a beautiful woman...
Sakura, Sakura!
Everything will be all right now!
I brought along an awesome person.
Sasuke will be fine now!
Naruto...
Those two flowers aren't fromthe same day.
So this kid is coming hereevery day, huh...
I heard from Guy Sensei...
Please save Sasuke.
OK, leave it to me.
Sasuke!
Sasuke...
Sasuke!
Sasuke, you...!
Hmm, despite his appearance,that Naruto is pretty considerate.
Huh?
Next! Next!
How disgraceful!
To be taken down byjust two insurgents.
And here I thought you were a genius.
I'm sorry...
All right! Kakashi Sensei's done!
Next, Bushy Brow!
Please hurry up andtake a look at my disciple Lee!
Lee!
I brought Lady Tsunade here!
That's your disciple?
Yes! My beloved, beloved disciple!
I see...
Naruto.
Huh?
Is it really okay for youto be idling away your time here like this?
Uh, I almost forgot!
I had an appointment tomeet Iruka Sensei!
Go on!
OK! I'll leave the rest in your hands!
All right!
Hey, Naruto!
You're late, Iruka Sensei!
Sorry, sorry.
There were lots of things to dowith respect to the Fifth Hokage.
I guess...
Thanks for waiting!
I'm digging in!
Naruto.
Huh...?
You have really developed comparedto the time when you wanted this.
I have, haven't l?
You think so too, right?
This headband that I receivedfrom Iruka Sensei
suits me perfectly, don't you think?
Stop being so cocky!
You still have a long,long way to go!
You have lots of work to do!
Listen carefully, Naruto!
The Leaf Village is ina very difficult situation right now.
Starting with the Third Hokage,we lost many fine Shinobi.
The current strength of the Leafis less than half what it normally is.
Despite that, we must continueto carry out our missions.
Why is that?
If you don't have enough manpower,you should turn it down.
No, that won't do...
If we turn down our missions,
it would be like announcingto other countries our weakened state.
Even Kakashi Sensei who is still ailingwill probably be assigned to missions.
I see... these are difficult times.
Hey! This concerns you too!
You need to play an active roleand carry out your duties
in order to aid Lady Tsunade.
Yeah.
But, before I do that,I need to satisfy my stomach.
That's just like you.
Do your best!
Seconds!
Hey, hey!How'd you finish so fast?!
I'll be straight with you.
Give up being a Shinobi.
L-Lady Tsunade...don't joke like that.
There are numerous bone fragmentsin the area around important nerves.
Moreover, they are deeply embedded.
You're not physically capableof carrying out the missions of a Shinobi.
Come now, Lady Tsunade,don't joke like that...
Even if I were to operate...
Don't be fooled, Lee!
That Lady Tsunade is an impostor!
You changed yourselfusing the Transformation Jutsu,
you evil woman!
Who the heck are you?!
Don't I have any... chance?
There is no one besides mewho is capable of doing the surgery
and it would take too much time.
Furthermore, there is a huge risk...
Risk?
The probability ofa successful surgery is 50% at best,
and if it fails...
You'll die.
Guy Sensei!
I'm not at all readyto throw in the towel!
Guy Sensei, what's this god-awfulbitter rice dumpling?
They are Youthful Vigor Herbal Pills.
If you eat one hundred of them,they should heal your wound.
I see, if I don't eatone hundred of them,
my wound won't heal, right?
N-Not in a single day!
It's better that you give up beinga Shinobi and look for a different path.
Lee...
Lee...
If I knew this was going to happen,I shouldn't have brought you to him.
Don't say that...!
I am painfully aware of how you feel,but it's better to be clear.
Because it's something he'll haveto understand sooner or later.
The longer we wait...
the harder it will be for him.
I believe your promise,its a true heart give me courage
Always I feel itthe precious time with you
On your still shoulder
I feel the wind that blowstowards tomorrow
The city lights are like pieces of stars
That hold us together
"Each one of us glows differently, "
you say laughingly
but you look most dazzling
Like a comet,
like the rainbow after the storm
You bring light into my heart
Being lost can be the answer
Let's promise we won't cheat
Uh...like a shooting star,we do go ahead.
Konohamaru, just come outfrom there already!
Shut up!
Listen, I'll treat you toa bowl of ramen!
Don't want any!
OK then. I'll add pork slices and eggs.
You're such a pest!
What did you just say?!
In that case,I'll pull you out by force!
Be ready for that!
Next time:"The Will of Fire Still Burns!"
Don't miss it!
C'mon!
Running like a fugitive,
Being chased by something
Inside my heart is pounding
My throat dry like it's withering
For no single one,
To none does belong,
This time is ours, right now...
Unraveling the pain,
Unraveling our hearts,
Unraveling shadows
Stifling our breath,
Reaching for beyond,
Tearing through the dark
In fighting and in love
To the distant light above,
Yes, we are on the way
I wanna rock...
Rockin' my heart
Sorry to keep you waiting.
I'm lbiki Morino, proctor forthe first test of the Chunin Exam.
You, from Hidden Sound Village!
No doing as you pleasebefore the Exam!
You want to be failedat the get go?!
Sorry. It's our first time taking the Exams,so we flipped out...despite ourselves.
Hmph.This is a good opportunity,so I'll say this.
There will be no battles,competitions and the like
without the permissionof the proctors!
And even if you get permission,
actions that could lead to the deathof an opponent will not be permitted.
Any pig that screws with mewill be disqualified immediately.
Got it?!
This Exam looks to be easy!
Now then, we will startthe first test of the Chunin Exam!
Turn in your applications,
take one of these number cardsin exchange,
and sit in the seatmatching that number!
After that, we will hand outthe paper for the written test!
Written...? Paper...?
Paper...
A paper test?!
Start Your Engines:The Chunin Exam Begins!
Everyone's seats are all scattered...What should I do?
He's deflated, deflated...
It's the worst type of test for Naruto...
Naruto...
Oh! You are Hinata...!Since when have you...?
L-Let's both do our best.
Y-Yeah.
I didn't notice her at all.
Hinata has no presence at all...
There are several importantrules to this first test.
I will take no questions,so listen well accordingly!
Rules? No questions will be taken...?
First off is the first rule!
You are given ten pointseach from the start!
The written test hasten problems in all!
Each problem is one point.
And, this test is apoint deduction system.
You are deducted one point foreach problem you get wrong!
If you get three wrong,you'll have seven points!
If I get ten wrong,I'll have zero points...
The second rule.
Pass or failure will be determined
by the total points ofthe three-person teams.
W-Wait a minute!
What do you mean...total points of the teams?
Shut up!
There's a perfectlygood reason for this!
Shut up and listen!
Reason...?
If you've got it,here is the most important next rule!
Those who are deemed bythe sentinels
as having committed an act ofcheating or something similar to that...
will have two points deductedfor each act.
What...?
Oh!
In other words...
there may be those who will bedismissed during this test
without waiting for test grading.
This means they're deducting points
from things otherthan the written test problems.
Know that those whocommit awkward cheating...
will bring ruin upon yourselves.
I'll check you anytime.
If you aspire to becomea Chunin at all,
know that Shinobi should actlike exemplary Shinobi.
Relax...!Yes...yes!
Naruto aside,Sasuke and I are okay!
Even if Naruto gets zero points...if we cover that...
And, in the case of even one personon the team getting zero points...
Everyone on that team will fail!
Wha--?!
What did he say...?!
I feel two menacing stares...
Naruto?
By the way, the last problem willbe given forty-five minutes
after the start of the test!
The time for the test is one hour.
Begin!
Could it...
Could it be that,the fat is really on the fire now...?
Naruto...!Just don't get zero points!
Naruto isn't getting jittersfrom the get go, is he...?
This is bad...
As if!
I know I've cleared many obstacleslike this before...
At times like this, one shouldlook at all the problems
without feeling pressedor making a fuss!
And then with utmost effort
I should tackle the problems that lookeasy to understand!
Let's see, the first problem...is a code text, eh...
Excellent, I say!
Next! Next!
Let's see... the second problem...
The parabola B in the diagram illustratesthe greatest possible distance
Enemy Ninja A can throw his Shurikenfrom a tree seven meters high...
Predict and answer the Enemy Ninja'scharacter inferred
from the ellipse this Shuriken forms,
also answer the longest firing rangein battle on flat ground
and explain your basis.
T-This is an...integrated problem basedon predictions
of uncertain conditions anddynamic energy analysis application...!
There's no wayaruto can solve this!
I mean...
hardly anyone except mecan solve this problem!
Okay, next!ext!
These other problems...are nothing but difficult ones.
I see...
I don't... understand evenone of these problems.
Oh, no, this is bad!
For real! For real!
What should I do?What should I do? What should I do?
If about ten of all fifty-one teamsare able to pass,
it will be bad if I didn't stretch myself andget a considerable amount of points.
It's like a system inviting cheating...
I hope Sasuke and Narutowon't panic and cheat.
It's okay...aruto's not that much of an idiot...
I know that...
Don't panic...
For now, all there is to do is to bevery, very cautious...
and cheat without being found out!
No! No! I can't, that's no good,no good!
I can't tread on such thin ice!
At any rate, this elaborate fuss...
It's like a trick assumingthat we're going to cheat.
They probably check with that paper...
Somebody got nailed.
Cheating deducts two points.
Two-point deduction, huh...
Ordinarily, it'd be failure the momentthe cheating was discovered...
Know that those whocommit awkward cheating
will bring ruin upon themselves.
Shinobi should act like exemplary Shinobi.
I see, so that's how it is, eh.
This wasn't just an achievement test!
The real aim was...
a test to see the abilityfor intensive information collection
with the full use of deceptionand concealment techniques.
"Shinobi should readthe double bluff, " eh...
In other words, the true intentionof the proctor is...
if you're going to cheat,not "awkward cheating, "
but "like exemplary Shinobi",don't get caught.
Viewed in this light, the extraordinarinessof the point deduction system,
the lenience of only deducting two pointsfor each discovery of cheating makes sense.
In other words,
what's being tested here is howwe can gather the correct answers
without having our cheating detectedby the proctors or
by the one being cheated on.
Realize it quick, Naruto!
It'll turn into a fatal mistake!
Realize it!
This is bad. Believe it...
If the purpose of this test is seeingthe ability to gather information...
then there should be someonein this classroom somewhere...
who knows the answersto the problems!
So Gaara has also started, eh...
Hmph... I'm counting on you, Crow.
Yahoo, good boy, Akamaru!ext is problem four!
Judging from this rhythm...
The stroke order...and the number of strokes...
I see.
Okay! Please tell me.
Eight, huh.
Lee, if you can see it,wear your headband!
Time is rapidly going by!
Oh, man! I'm afraid all thereis to do is cheat...
But, if I'm discovered,
it'll be trouble for Sakuraand Sasuke.
On the other hand,if I get zero points...
Sakura and Sasuke will bemy companions in failure.
Naruto...
I'll show you...my test.
Huh...?
What is Hinata saying...?
W-Why would she dosuch a thing for me?
Could it be...some kind of trickery?
But Hinata is not one to dosomething like that...
No... But she might've been coaxed intoattempting to trap me by Kiba and others...
Hinata, let me ask you one thing!
Huh?!
Why would you show me?
Uh...uh...actually...
I... I...
I don't want you, Naruto...to leave at this stage...
Y-You see...the nine of us are the only rookies...
and I have many anxieties aboutwhat's to come, so!
I get it now! I was kind ofstrangely suspicious of you!
Anyhow! This is crazy lucky, I say!
Thank goodness I'm next to Hinata...
W-What was that?I was about to turn...
W-What was that for, sir?!
You made five mistakes. You fail!
N-No way...
His two buddies, both of you get outof the classroom, right now.
#23 fails!
#43 and #27 fail!
Noooo!
Hey, hey! Do you have proof thatI cheated five whole times?!
Really, are you guys properly checkingthis number of people...?
Listen up...
Even among us Chunin, we're elitewho were selected for this Exam.
We don't overlook you blinking once...
In a matter of speaking,this strength is the proof.
Naruto...?
Hurry...Look...
Hinata... You don't get it, do you?
What...?
An awesome ninja like mewon't cheat. Believe it!
N-Naruto.
B-But...
Also, if something went wrong,
you'd be in a hot spot forhelping me cheat, right?!
What?!
Naruto...
I'm...sorry...I-I did something uncalled for...
Nah, it's okay.
I... went and acted big.
What should I do?I'm extremely stupid.
Byakugan!
Sharingan!
I'll copy all his movements!
My hand is moving fluently...
I hit the jackpot straight awaywith this guy.
Sakura, it looks like you're done, eh.
I'm acknowledging that your smarts
and the width of your foreheadare exceptional.
So you should thank me.
Thank me for getting to bethe target for this Jutsu.
Ninja Art, Mind Transfer Jutsu!
So lno...started using that Jutsu...
There's no countering that spell of lno's...
Sakura, I let myself moveinto your mind for just a little bit.
I have to memorize the answers quick.
I've got to pass these answersto Shikamaru and Choji.
#59! Fails!
#33! #9!
This is the thirteenth group to fail.
#41 fails.
#35, #62 fails!
No way!
That brat...
He coolly proceeds through thisruckus without moving an eyelash.
Very well done considering he's new.
The optic nerves are connected...
The third eye... open!
Ugh! There's dirt in my eye...
Dang it...!
Excuse me.
What is it?
I need to go to the bathroom...
We will accompany youto the bathroom.
I see...
Anyhow...the proctors arenothing so special!
They don't realize that the proctorshave increased by one...
Eh, don't you think so...
Crow...?
Forty minutes have passedsince the test started...
Twenty minutes left...huh...
Since it's come to this,
it's the last problem to be givenforty-five minutes after the start of the test.
All there is to do is bet on this.Believe it!
Even if I take it, I'm a Genin for lifeonce I get it wrong?!
Really? Really? Really?
If I don't take it, I'll fail withmy comrades immediately?
No way, no way, no way.
The hopeless rule for problem ten!
Not good, not good, not good.
No way can I choose which one!
What to do, do, do, do.
This is seriously, seriously bad!
Bad, bad, bad, bad.
Next episode:"The T enth Question: All or Nothing!"Press down hard on the gas
That's right, there's no compromise
We'll slip through the night
At the final moment push hard
That's right, all the way to zero,
Until we wipe away the days
Gently open your heart
If you pull it close to you
It will reach you, without a doubt
It will come, closer
Now
We're speeding through life,squeezing it for all of its worth
Our feet are tied
But we still keep going farther
Even if I take it back, and grasp it
If you're not the one
There will be no meaning
And so we'll go far off into the distance.

Curse Sealing!
Out of character.
It appears he's quite tired...
To think you've become able tohandle Sealing Jutsu...
You've grown, eh, Kakashi...?
You...
Long time no see, Kakashi.
Orochimaru...
Kakashi vs. Orochimaru:Face to Face!
Sorry, but...
I have no business with you, Kakashi.
But I do with the kid behind you.
Why are you after Sasuke...?!
It's good for you.You already got it, right?
You didn't have it before, did you...?
That.
That...
left eye Sharingan!
I want it, too...
The Uchiha power.
Come on. Get up.
W-What?!
B-Bugs?
They burst through the skin...from inside his body?!
What a creepy guy!
Heh! What kind of bluffare you trying to pull?
These things are called Parasitic insects.
They attack their pray in groupsand eat Chakra...
If attacking in this amount...
you're finished, no mistake.
If you don't like that, give up.
That would be in your best interests.
If you use your left armtechnique on me,
I'll simultaneously have the bugs exploitthe opening from behind.
Conversely, if you useyour technique on the bugs,
I'll simultaneously exploit the opening...
Either way, you won't be ableto get through this.
An ace in the hole is somethingyou set aside.
Hey! Hold it!
You little thief!
Someone! Grab him!
Uh-oh.
Man, what a pigheaded kid.
Making us go to trouble!
You have potential, boy.
I liked your eyes earlier...
If you come with me,you can become strong.
Follow me.
If you come with me,you can become strong.
You can become strong.
Fight for me. If you do that...
I'll make you stronger.
Now, please live up to my expectations...
No longer...
will l...
It seems like you're proudof your arms. You!
S-Stop it!
Stop!
No longer...
can I make thingsblow up in my face!
Don't...underestimate me!
An ace in the hole is somethingyou set aside, right?!
An ace in the hole is somethingyou set aside, right?
What?! He could alreadyuse his right arm?!
So the first half of the battle wasa strategic move
to make us think he couldn'tuse his right arm.
Not bad...Zaku.
What's your purpose?
The recently built Sound Village.That's my village, you see...
You already understand, don't you...?
Humph! Ridiculous ambition.
Oh, my... you said it.
But, for that I need various pieceswho will obey my every whim.
Take this!
So Sasuke is one of those pieces?
No. Sasuke is an exceptional piece.
And the ones who are takingthe exams now...
are mere throw-away pieces.
My arms!
What's this?!
Earlier when I recommendedthat you give up...
as a precautionary measure,I gave a suggestion to the bugs...
to block that troublesome wind holewith their bodies and remain still.
This is what a real ace in the hole is.
Punk!
Don't... come any closer...to Sasuke!
Even if you're one ofthe legendary three Ninja,
at the least,I can kill you as you kill me!
What's funny?
What you say and what you do,are all off.
What?
There's no point at all inattempting such a seal.
You understand, don't you?
The heart to seek outin pursuit of the goal,
no matter what obstructive powerthere may be...
He is the possessor of that quality.
He's an avenger...
So you took advantage of that, eh?
However, Sasuke is...
At some point,he will definitely seek me out...
in search of power.
Oh, and, you're going to kill me...?
Why don't you try?
That is, if you can...
Kill you as you kill me...?!
Am I an idiot...?
It seems... it's over.
The winner! Shino Aburame!
W-What is he, Neji?!
Byakugan!
He's something else...!
I can understand him calling bugswith a Summoning Jutsu...
but he harbors bugs all over his body.
S-Say what?!
He's of the bug tamer race thatis passed down in the Leaf Village.
Speaking of which,I've heard of it...
The story of a race that asthey come into this world,
possess the secret technique of loaningtheir bodies to bugs
as a nest and fight using these bugs.
They fully control the bugs andentrust most of the battle to the bugs...
I hear that they contract to keepgiving the bugs their own Chakra
as food for compensation.
So he's... the successor?
That was unfortunate, Zaku.
Why'd that happen to Zaku's arms?
Probably, that guy calledShino or whatever...
exploited the opening andstuck those bugs
into the exhaust opening in Zaku's hands.
If he were to fire the Slicing Sonic Wavein that condition,
the energy with no way outwould expand in search of an exit...
His arms that aregun barrels blow up...
and become useless.
Our relationship was only thatof having been given the same mission...
but... I'll even the score for you.
Whew. He gives me a chill, indeed...
What?! What?!
So Shino, you were that strong,weren't you?! Dang it!
I thought he wasa creepy person from long before, but...
Oh...
S-Shino, good...work...
Hey, you did it!
Yes... I'm counting on you guys, too.
He comes back like he'sthe team leader or something! Dang it!
Umm, now then, I would like toget right to the next match.
Kakashi Sensei!
Yo!
Not, "Yo!" Kakashi Sensei!
What about Sasuke? Is he okay?
Well, he's fine.
He's sleeping soundly in the infirmary.
However, with Anbu Opsstanding as guards...
Oh.
Tsurugi Misumi vs. Kankuro
It's finally my turn.
Kankuro, he's totally underestimating this...
Humph. Idiot...
It's him...!
Unlike Yoroi, I don't getcareless with kids at all.
I'll say this first, once I do my technique...
give up no matter what...
I'll bring it to an end swiftly.
If so, I'll also...
bring it to an end swiftly!
Now then, please begin...
the third battle!
Hey, can you hear it?
The clear, blue sky goes on and on
The ocean spans limitlessly
Please keep that smile on your face forever
Or else I'll cry
You won't have to search around you
It's all ok now.
Everyone is insidethis hand
when you want to cry,and you want to run away
When you forget what happiness is
Just sing.
Light is born, and darkness was born
The two are one
Harmonia, feel the telepathy
Hey, can you hear it?
I believed in your words the whole time.
I wanted to be like you.
I thought it would be niceif that happened.
So Ino, I want to fight the full-tilt you.
I'm no longer like I was before.
There's no point if I don'texceed the serious you.
Next episode: "Kunoichi Rumble:The Rivals Get Serious!"

But that's my decision.
Bushy Brow's Jutsu: Sasuke Style!
Hey Guy! You too, Lee...
Is your body all right?
Kakashi!
Kakashi Sensei!
Oh! Sorry, sorry.
You must've been worried.Sorry for not contacting you at all...
Oh no, Sakura's gonna get really mad...
I don't really mind that.
It's hard to see from here...
Sasuke...
Kakashi Sensei...
Hm?
You know about the markon Sasuke's neck, don't you?
Is that...?
No need to worry.
A mark?
So, that's that.
Yup!
One...
Two...
Three...
Four...
Five...
Six...
Seven...
Eight.
Eight of them...
There are eight members ofAnbu Black Ops in this spacious arena...
Two platoons are too few...
What's Lord Hokage thinking?
Well...without knowing how or whenthe opponent would make their move...
It can't be helped that the Anbuare dispersed and deployed
in important areas in the village.
Huh?
It's about to begin.
We shouldn't let our guard down,but for now...
We need to pay attention...to this match.
Kakashi, I'll be carefully checking outwhat sort of training you gave him...
as your eternal rival!
Huh? Did you say something?
No! You're slick, Kakashi!
Why are you always so avant-garde?!
Both of you, to the middle!
Begin!
So this is the sandKakashi told me about...
Please don't get so mad...
Mother...
What's he talking about...?
Earlier... Earlier I had you suckawful-tasting blood.
I'm sorry.
But this time it'll likely...
taste good.
His conversation's started.This is dangerous.
This is the first time I've seen Gaaraget like that before fighting.
So it must mean his opponentis that imposing...
Him.
It appears he's calmed down.
Come on.
Hey...
Do you remember...what he said yesterday?
At that time...
I will kill...you all without fail.
Just wait.
That's what he said...
But he didn't do it.
It was the perfect opportunity, but...
he didn't even see us.
Now, let me feel it!
We're...
unsatisfactory for him.
Right now, the only one whocan make him feel anything...
... is only Sasuke!
I live fighting for only myselfand loving myself...
And if I see that all other peoplein this world
exist only to make me realize that,
there could be no world more wonderful.
Naruto...
Here we go!
The Sand Shield becamea Sand Clone!
He's fast! This guy...is just like that guy...
He's fast! It's nearly the sameas Lee's ordinary speed.
And...
It's overlapping with the image...
of my Taijutsu!
Is that the Sand Armor?
Come on!
Thank you, Anbu man.
So apparently, Hinata will beall right for now if she rests.
Oh, is that right?
Huh? You know this person?What're you taking about?
This person is an Anbu...
Not that, but at the examination...?What do you mean?
Well, this is what it means...
Come on!
If you're not gonna come at me,I'll go at you!
He's fast!
What's the matter? Is that it?
A-Amazing...
That armor... I'll tear it off.
His speed is basically the sameas Lee's with the weights removed.
It's... It's exactly likeLee's Taijutsu.
His speed is also completelydifferent from before!
Sasuke... You are indeeda genius beyond imagination.
How many years did it take meto attain that speed...?
And you attained it in a mere month...!
However, it seems to consumea lot of stamina
to continue that movement.
What's Gaara planning to do?
The sand armor uses up toomuch Chakra...
It can't last for very long.
What the heck sort of trainingdid you do?!
Hm?
To get to that level in a mere month...
Sasuke had copied Lee's Taijutsuwith Sharingan.
So during the Taijutsu training...
I had Sasuke image Lee's movements.
Sasuke could makethat movement his own
only because he knew Lee.
Of course, Sasuke had towork very hard for it.
But...with only that...
With only Taijutsu...that Sand guy can't be taken down!
That Kakashi...
He must have seen the battle
between the hateful Gaaraand the lovable Lee.
Taijutsu that was taught suddenly
can't work against an opponentthat even Lee couldn't take down.
He should have known this only to well.
So if that's the case...
Why is it that he had Sasukemaster only Taijutsu?!
Why did I keep living?
But as long as you're alive,you need a reason...
If you don't have one,it's just the same as being dead.
What's this guy saying?!
So this is the answer I came to...
I am living in order to killhuman beings other than myself.
After living in the fear of never knowingwhen I might be murdered,
finally, I became calm.
Oh?
Shikamaru...
We need to go over to whereKakashi Sensei is right now!
What're you planning to do?
Hey!
I'm going to...
stop this match!
Gaara couldn't possibly be planningto use that Jutsu!
So he used all the sand for protection...
I didn't think there could be thismuch of a difference in the hardness
with a difference in the densityof the sand.
So it's absolute protection.
The sand...It's covered his entire body.
This is somewhat troublesome.
Now, how will Sasuke proceed?!
Kakashi Sensei!
Naruto!
Huh? What do you want?
Sensei!Please stop this match right away!
That guy is totally different from us!
He's not normal!
Naruto...What're you saying?
He lives to kill people.
In any case...
If this continues, Sasuke will die!
Jin, Saru,
Ne, Saru, Tori, Tatsu, Ne, Saru...
There's no mistake about it.It's that Jutsu!
This isn't good!Our plan isn't even on Gaara's mind.
Shoot!
Kakashi Sensei!
Everyone makes mistakesIt's nothing to be ashamed about
Don't let this scar be for naughtWalk with a smile
Yes, breathe in the airLift your face to the sky and jump
If it rains, take a breakGo where the wind takes you
So many regretsDon't let this scar be for naught

Everyone makes mistakesIt's nothing to be ashamed about
Don't let this scar be for naughtWalk with a smile
Transform sadness into the windand continue to forge on
Forge on strong
Sasuke, when I fought you once, I said
Even if one understands visually,
it's meaningless unless onecan move physically.
I was filled witha sense of superiority.
But now, you have a body that movesat the same high speed as mine.
Moreover, you have...Sharingan!

They all bring back memories...
Shall we have a reunionor something, Jiraiya?
Fool! I summon you after a long absence
and you make these boring jokes.
The time to conclude this long,fateful confrontation has come.
I'm bringing Orochimaru down,here and now!
Hey Orochimaru...
Why'd you have to summon meto a place like this?!
You... I'm going to eat you up!
Don't say that, Lord Manda...
You will be duly rewarded.
Who said I'm talking to you?!
Don't be so flippant, brat!
Hey, Orochimaru...
I expect you to preparea sacrificial offering of 1 00 people later.
Though Lord Orochimaru isManda's master,
if Manda learns that Lord Orochimarucan't use Jutsu,
Manda will no doubtdouble-cross him.
Despite the fact that he hadno other choice, in his condition,
it was too risky for Lord Orochimaruto summon Manda.
Katsuyu... take that kid to Shizune!
Y es, ma'am.
All right! I can fight, too!
Shizune, please take care of this child.
Naruto...
Also, the battle is going to getquite vicious from now.
Please go far away with my cloneand conceal yourself...
That's what Lady Tsunade wants.
Lady Tsunade...
You...
I'll hang you out until you're dry!
I've been wanting a snakeskin wallet...
Orochimaru,you've sunk too deeply into vice!
We are no longer comrades.
Comrades?
That word makes me shiver.
Today is the last day thatwe are called Sannin!
Acid Slime!
I'll start with this one!
Katsuyu!
Lady Tsunade...
Here they come!
I know!
Tsunade! Stay away!
Bunta! Give me some oil!
Okay!
Fire Style!
Toad Oil Flamethrower!
Humph... How's that?
Did it work?
No, that's...
Molten skin! He shed his skin!
Bunta! Under the earth!
What?!
It's the tail?!
Keep it shut!
They're Sannin, all right.
Dealing with two of them is rough.
Tsunade!
Well now, I can kill youby wringing your neck.
My Chakra...
At this rate...
Even though you sayyou won't die in battle,
you won't have a choice ifI rip your neck off...
Right, Tsunade?
How many minutes...
How many seconds can I hold on...?
I have to put it on the line!
Fine!
It's about time we put an end to this!
R-Ridiculous!
Not done yet!
Take this!
Darn it...!
Lady Tsunade... Not that...!
She's reached her limit...
No...
This guy...
I've hurled him around that much,yet he's still...
So this is as far as you can go.
Shut up!
Don't rest!
Keep beating him.
This is the battle...
where I put my life on the line!
Lord Orochimaru!
I won't let you go!
You will stay with me until the end!
Take this!
I hit him and hit him.Something's different...
What is it?This...strange sense of discomfort?
However, with this...!
It's over!
He took a direct hit!
That was it.
Yeah...
Lord Orochimaru...
Putting me in this position!
I want to eat you and kill you,
but I can't even chew you upwith this hole in my mouth...
Next time, if we meet again,be prepared!
Tsunade...
Even though you won't heal me,I still have one way.
A way to resurrect these arms.
The Leaf Village...I'll destroy it...without fail.
At that time, it would be niceif we could meet again...
My comrades...Tsunade and Jiraiya.
That face...?!
In some way or another,he took someone else's body...?!
No wonder,when we went at it a while ago,
I didn't get the same feelingfrom him that I did in the past...
The true elixir of life.
That's my...
my immortality!
Some day, in the future...
Wait!
The bones in my ribs and feetare broken...
The side effects of the Jutsuare starting...
My body is...already...
Tsunade, you haven't changed.You're no good at wagers.
The Hokage is my dream!
I'll give you one week.
If you can master that Jutsu,
I'll acknowledge that you havewhat it takes to become the Hokage...
and give you this necklace.
It's no joke!
If I have three days,I'll master this Jutsu!
Men don't go back on their word!
I'm the grandson of the Hokage whobuilt the Village Hidden in Leaves, so...!
You said it.Men don't go back on their word!
Right! I'll become just like Grandfather.And the Hokage name will be mine!
Becoming the Hokage is my dream!
I love this village and my comrades.
So I want to protect them.
An existence that protects everyone.
Becoming the Hokage is my dream...
I'd like you... to take this.
Any time now, the side effects...
Lady Tsunade...
You...
It's nothing... If I rest a bit, I'll returnto my young form.
I'll rest in town.
And when Naruto wakes up,We'll return to Konoha.
Tsunade...
Starting now, don't call me Tsunade.Call me...
The Fifth Hokage?!
Old Lady Tsunade isthe Fifth Hokage starting today...
What, you look disgruntled, Naruto.
After all, compared to the old man,the Third Hokage,
there's something...
rough-natured and kind of selfish...
loose with money, catty and stupid...
Somehow, I'm going to worryif she can do it properly.
Lady Tsunade, would you liketo order something...
Moreover, a 50-year-old ladytransforming into a young lady...
Is it okay for the person whowill become Hokage
to lie to everyone, I wonder...?
Go outside, brat!
It's just like before...
Despite how I look,I'm going to be the Fifth Hokage.
I shouldn't takethis short brat of a foe seriously...
This one is enough...
Don't call me brat!
I may be like this now,but I'll be Hokage some day!
Here I go!
Another brow flick?!
Become a fine man...
and, a fine Hokage.
Yeah!
Okay! Shall we go home?
T o our hometown the Leaf Village!
What? I haven't eaten yet...!
Don't try to distract me by laughing!
Nawaki... Dan...
the boy who will inherit your dreams,my beloved ones,
is right here!
I believe your promise,its a true heart give me courage
Always I feel itthe precious time with you
On your still shoulder
I feel the wind that blowstowards tomorrow
The city lights are like pieces of stars
That hold us together
"Each one of us glows differently, "
you say laughingly
but you look most dazzling
Like a comet,
like the rainbow after the storm
You bring light into my heart
Being lost can be the answer
Let's promise we won't cheat
Uh...like a shooting star,we do go ahead.
Yahoo! Here we areat a hot spring spot!
While Pervy Sage is gawking at women,and Old Lady Tsunade is out somewhere,
I'm gonna relax and enjoy myself!
What?! Who worked over my room?!
I don't know who they are,
but I'm gonna find themand kick their butts!
Next time: "Kidnapped!aruto's Hot Spring Adventure!"Yeah, turn your sadness into kindness, your uniqueness into strength
Even if you get lost, let's start walking
One more time
Are you really happy
when you're always meeting to someone's expectations?
Even if you change to who you really wanna be
Will you always have a great smile?
Dreaming of only "the beginning," I wake up
and someday, I'll live on my own.
Yes, precious things are never in shape
You never know what it is when you get it or lose it
Yeah, turn your sadness into kindness, your uniqueness into strength
Even if you get lost, let's start walking
One more time

Naruto...!
He came in totally late.
Hmm? Where's Sasuke?
The Dosu guy I'm supposedto fight isn't here, either.
Hey, you guys over there.
Throw out your chests andshow your faces to the spectators!
You guys are the starsof this "final round"!
Sasuke hasn't been found yet?
A team of several Anbu membersare searching all over,
but they have found nothing.
He might already be inthe hands of Orochimaru...
If that's the case,we may never find him.
I understand.
Well-well... Lord Kazekage.
You must be tired havingcome all this way.
No... I'm glad the arenais in the Leaf Village.
Even though you're still young, it wouldprobably be a tough journey for you
if you had to go to the troubleof traveling someplace else.
Shouldn't you decide onthe Fifth Hokage soon?
Please don't treat melike an old person.
I'm still planning onbeing Hokage for another five years...
Now then, I guess it'sabout time to begin.
Everyone, thank you very muchfor coming
to the Village Hidden in LeavesChunin Exam.
We will now begin the"final round" matches
for the eight who made itthrough the preliminaries!
Please watch until the end!
If there are supposed to be eight,it looks like there's one missing.
I have something to tellyou before the match.
Look at this.
Huh?!
There was a slight changeto the tournament.
Check who you'll be facingone more time.
Here, I had more preliminarymatches than the others...
So the Dosu guy dropped out?
I thought I'd pound you here...
If I did that,there'd be the possibility for me,
as the one remaining afterthe first battle, to fight Sasuke.
W-What are you?!
Say...
... say.
What?
Umm... Sasuke still hasn't come.
What'll happen?
I wonder if Sasuke really did sneak outof the hospital room at that time.
Something could've happened to him...
In case a competitor does not arriveby the start time of his match...
he or she will lose by default!
It doesn't make sense.
Knowing his character,he'd come even if he had to drag himself.
Where are you going, Gaara?
To verify my existence...one more time.
One more time.
What's wrong?You should still be able to move, right?!
Sasuke! Come on!
Could it be...?
Even after I warned him to avoiddoing anything to stand out...
He didn't kill that Sasuke Uchihaalso, did he...?
Listen up, you guys.
The terrain is different,but the rule is that there are no rules,
the same asin the preliminaries.
The matches will continue until oneor the other dies, or acknowledges defeat.
However, if I judge that it has been settled,I'll stop the match there.
Arguments will not be allowed.
Understood?
So the first match is...
Naruto Uzumaki.
Neji Hyuga.
Just those two remain andthe rest of you go to the waiting room.
Byakugan vs. Shadow Clone!
Hey, Hinata! These seats are open.
Uh-huh.
This match will be quite interesting!
Naruto...
Say, Sakura.
I understand that you're worriedabout Sasuke.
But why don't you cheerfor Naruto at least a little bit?
Hmm. You're right.
That being said,
with Neji as his opponent,aruto has no chance of winning.
That is...!
Not so, is what you'regoing to say?
But to think that brat wouldsurvive until this point...
I wonder if this isas far as it goes
for those who survivedjust by luck, after all.
That Naruto.
This is not a good opponent at all.
No matter how you look at it,he can't beat the Hyuga clan.
Well, that's what I thoughtat the beginning...
But you'll all be surprisedif you underestimate him.
Akamaru, what's wrong?
What did you say?!
What?! Where?!
There!
What's Anbu, the Black Ops,doing here?
Is something going on...?
You seem like you wantto say something.
I said it before, too, didn't l?
A failure is a failure.You can't change.
I promise...
I'll win, no matter what!
He has the look...of being sure of himself...
It's as if he's not all worked up...
That makes itmore worthwhile for me.
I look forward to your lookof disappointment...
when you know the true reality...
Stop whining.
Let's... get started!
Now then, round one.
Begin!
Watch carefully, Hanabi.
Nobody has inherited sucha strong Hyuga Kekkei Genkai.
To say nothing of your older sister.
More than big sister?
Perhaps more than you, too.
This time, it's not an opponentthat can be managed easily.
He has that Byakugan.
Close combat is no good...
Does Naruto know that?
Idiot! Why would anyoneattack from the front?!
No! Naruto.
The opponent can seeyour Chakra Points!
They're called Chakra Points.
If those pressure pointsare pressed accurately...
the flow of an opponent's Chakracan be stopped,
amplified or controlled at will.
Uh-oh!
I missed, huh...?
In other words, he'll pressthe pressure point if I get too close
and I'll become unableto use Jutsu.
That means all I can dois fight from a distance.
You understand, right?You have no way of winning.
Heh... All I did was to verify your power.
The real fight is just getting started!
Shadow Clone Jutsu!
You used your head,didn't you, Naruto?!
With the Shadow Clone Jutsu...
Heh. He's an interesting kid.
Shadow Clone Jutsu isa Jonin level technique.
To think he could usesuch an Jutsu...
Who knows how this'll turn out?
Shadow Clone Jutsu?!
I get it. If Chakra is evenly distributedamong the clones,
indeed, I can't detect thereal one even with my Byakugan.
But there's only one real one,after all!
Heh. Don't be acting tough!
If you're going to come,then come.
It's pointless.
In front of that Neji's defense,it's not just all attacking.
Hey!
Don't...you... underestimate...
... me!
Here they come!
He hit!
Fool.
Wha--?!
Dang it!
I'll get you next time!
Here!
This guy...
Does he have eyes behind him...?
You're going to become...the Hokage...?
With this level, it's impossible.
I can generally tellwith these eyes...
Intrinsic abilities are set.
Figuratively speaking,everything inherent about people is set.
Why...?
Why are you always sojudgmental like that?
Then... are you going to saythat anybody can become the Hokage...
if they just work hard?
Only a very small percentage ofShinobi are chosen to be the Hokage!
Look more at reality!
Those who become the Hokageare born with a destiny.
It's not something you becomeby trying to become it.
It's determined by destiny.
People must live withintheir different respective currents
that can't be defied.
The one single...destiny everyone has equally...
...is death.
Those eyes...
He still holds a grudgeagainst the head family, huh?
So...
So what?!
I don't know when to give up!Shadow Clone Jutsu!
One! First, Tyson jumps and slamdunks
Two! He kisses and hugs everyonerandomly and says "l LOVE YOU"
Three! Masala masters Yogabut hates curry
Four! Sanchez is a lousy bullfighter. Ole!
All over the world, the sky's smiling,so look up and smile too
Oh yeah! Oh yeah! Oh yeah!Fight! Fight! Fight!
One! Bodimahattaya-san devoteshis time for digging black ships
Two! Peking Duck, Action Scene,Chen Lee speeds around on his bike
Three! Popo loves to polish his Coteka
Four! Japanese people,now lend me you hand!
All over the world, the sky's smiling,so look up and smile too
Oh yeah! Oh yeah! Oh yeah!Fight! Fight! Fight!
All over the world, the sky's smiling,so look up and smile too
Oh yeah! Oh yeah! Oh yeah!Fight! Fight! Fight!
Darn it! What is going on?!
It was clear that my punch got him,but I'm the one who was thrown!
Darn it!Even though I promised Hinata....
I really cannot lose ata place like this!
The next hit will be the big onethat I'm gonna give him!
Just prepare for it!
Next time, "Ultimate Defense:Zero Blind Spot!"

W-What the heck is going on here?
Hmm...
Help me!
Excuse me there, Mister!Wait just a moment!
What in the world is happening?
You should run away too!
There's a monster up there!
A monster...?
What could it be?This monster thing?!
It's a g-gigantic snake!It destroyed the castle in a flash!
How big of a snake?!
Me too, at my village before...
I was attacked by a huge snake!
We must hurry, Naruto!
That snake is probably the same onethat you saw before.
Destroy the Leaf Village...?!
And your answer is?
Lady Tsunade!
No! You must not believein their sweet talk...
Your brother and my unclewouldn't want any of that!
Their wishes...
Moreover, Tsunade, your wishes...
And dreams...Did you forget them?!
I know it!
Even if you are like this now,you still...
Open your eyes! Wake up, please!
Shut up, Shizune!
You don't have to answer right now.
However, I want it in a week.
Also, two human sacrifices are neededfor this Forbidden Jutsu,
so do what you need to doto prepare them.
Lady Tsunade, let's kill them right here!It's our chance!
With you and me, now we can...!
Lady Tsunade...
Sure, I am weak now.
However...
I also know Tsunade's weakness.
That's right, he is one of the Sanninlike Tsunade.
So he knows that...
I see it's not cured yet...
your fear of blood.
Hemophobia...?
Shall we get going, Kabuto?
Tsunade... I'll be expectinga favorable answer from you.
Looks like we were a little too late...
Is this that snake's doing, too?!
- Let's go, Naruto!- Huh?
Tsunade isn't here any more.
Geez, you keep telling me that...!
Welcome!
Hey, you ol' man, give me another shot!
Lady Tsunade, you're drinking too much!
Lady Tsunade...
Heck, she's nowhere to be found!
Dragging me around here and there,
but after all,we haven't found a single trace!
Hmm?
Well, let's dine here for now.
Huh?
Isn't this a pub?
So what?
I've told you so many times!I'm still underage!
You fool. Nobody is asking you to drink.Kids should only be eating snacks.
- Well then...- Welcome!
There's no need to dine here!
We can go to a ramen noodle shopor something!
How stupid! You can gather informationin this type of place...
Huh...?
Huh?!
Tsunade!
Jiraiya?!
Why... are you here?
I've finally found you!I'm exhausted...
That gal is Tsunade?!
She's 50 years old for real?
Now, that's a swindle.
I can't believe...I met two of the Sannin in one day.
Here you are!
In any case...Today is a day I see many old friends.
You mean Orochimaru...
What happened?
Nothing, really.We exchanged a greeting.
Is it really true that this galis the Kunoichi
who can heal any kind of wound?
What about you?
What do you want from me?
I'll be straight with you.
Tsunade, the village has demandedthat you become the Fifth Hokage.
Hey, ol' man,gimme the simmered meat with potatoes!
All right, in a moment.
The Fifth Hokage?!What's this out of the blue?!
What the heck is going on?!
Do you know about the Third Hokage?
The Third Hokage?So, he really was...
Orochimaru did it, right?
I heard about it.directly from him.
Orochimaru did it...?
Orochimaru?!
Did he really killed the old man,the Third Hokage?!
Who is this Orochimaru?!
Just like us, he's one of the Sannin.
Why?! The Sannin are allfrom Leaf Village, right?
Then why--?!
Who's this brat?
He's Naruto Uzumaki.
This brat is...that Nine-Tailed Fox...?
Hey, you just hold it there!
I am not done talking yet!
This Orochimaru?!This bastard that killed Old Man Hokage.
Who the heck is he?!
He's a legendary Sannin, right?!
Then knowing that...
why would you, Pervy Sage,leave such a guy alone?!
Besides...
What do you mean this personis the Fifth Hokage?!
Naruto, be quiet for a moment.
But...!
Just shut up!
I'll say this again.
They are demanding thatyou become the Fifth Hokage, Tsunade.
So what's your answer?
Will you accept it?
I'll resurrect the little brotherand man, both of whom you loved...
This time, I will completely destroy Leaf!
What do you say... Tsunade?
Lady Tsunade...
I really don't get it!
Impossible...
I refuse!
I remember... those words.
You said those same wordswhen I asked you to go out with me.
What the heck are you talking about?!You said it yourself!
Didn't you say thatyou will bring her back to the village
and have her treat Sasukeand Kakashi Sensei?!
But what's this demandfor her to be the Hokage?!
And, on top of that, she refuses!
Lady Tsunade...
Could she be thinking of makinga deal with Orochimaru?
Calm down.
There can't be no other Fifth Hokage,but this Tsunade.
During the dreadful Great War Era,
she contributed tremendouslyto the Leaf's victory.
To this date,
there's no one who can rivalher combat and medical skills.
Still more, this Tsunade isthe granddaughter of the First Hokage.
So together with her talents,
there's no one else more suitedto becoming the Fifth Hokage.
If she becomes Hokage,
that means thatshe'll come back to the village.
And then, as I'd told you,she can treat the two.
Besides, this is what the Leaf'stop decision-making advisors settled upon.
Genin like you have no sayon this matter.
Jiraiya...
Unlike your previous apprentice,
this kid not only has a bad mouth and wit,he's ugly to match.
What?!
It's tough on anyone to becompared to the Fourth Hokage.
He had all the qualities to bethe greatest Ninja in all history.
Brimming with talent in Jutsu,and he had a brilliant mind!
Popular with people and well...he was as handsome as me.
But even that Fourth Hokage died quickly.
Risking his own life for the village...
Life is different from money...
To easily risk it and lose it,is a fool's doing!
Did she say "fool"?!
Both my grandfather and the Second Hokage
seemed to want to subduethe disturbances of war above all else.
But after all, they died in vain,
in the midst of their dreamsfor the village.
You have changed, Tsunade...
I don't know whatyou thought in your heart before,
but to say such thing out loud...
Although I look young,I'm already in my 50s...
Years change people.
Same goes for Sarutobi Sensei...
No wonder he died showing offat that old age!
Hokage is a bother.
No one but a fool would take it on.
Why you--?!
- Let go of me!- Don't! We're in a pub.
I said, let go of me!
Lady Tsunade...!
Anyone who makes fun of the old manand the Fourth Hokage...
It doesn't matter ifyou are a woman!
I'll clobber you with all my might!
You're pretty gutsy...confronting me like this.
Let's take this outside, brat!
Lady Tsunade!
Though I may not look it,I am one of the Sannin.
Why should I even take a Genin seriously.
What did you say?!
An advance notice for a KO?
I don't mean one minute...
With one finger.This is enough to take you down.
Lady Tsunade!
Well...
Come on, kiddo.
D-Don't make fun of me!
Darn it!
Lady Tsunade!
Forehead poking?!
Why that no good--!
She's strong...
Hey, brat!
I'll ask you one thing before you faint.
Why... get so passionate atthe mention of Hokage's name?
Unlike you...
I will be the heir to the Hokage name,no matter what!
Because Hokage is...
Because Hokage is my dream!
That kid...
What? She's a bit off her guard...
I can't tackle her head on.
Then, I should use that Jutsu now...
Concentrate!
Oh, no!
Wha--?! This Jutsu is...!
Take this!
I believe your promise,its a true heart give me courage
Always I feel itthe precious time with you
On your still shoulder
I feel the wind that blowstowards tomorrow
The city lights are like pieces of stars
That hold us together
"Each one of us glows differently,"
you say laughingly
but you look most dazzling
Like a comet,
like the rainbow after the storm
You bring light into my heart
Being lost can be the answer
Let's promise we won't cheat
Uh...like a shooting star,we do go ahead.
It's been a long time since we drankalone like this, isn't it, Tsunade?
I didn't necessarily want to see you.
Don't say that.
By the way,you're prettier than before.
You haven't changed a bit.
Understand this.I'm not interested in you.
Neither am l.After all, you're actually 50 years old--
- Did you say something?- No, nothing.
I was just rememberingthe old days.
Next time: "Inheritance!"The Necklace of Death!"Press down hard on the gas
That's right, there's no compromise
We'll slip through the night
At the final moment push hard
That's right, all the way to zero,
Until we wipe away the days
Gently open your heart
If you pull it close to you
It will reach you, without a doubt
It will come, closer
Now
We're speeding through life,squeezing it for all of its worth
Our feet are tied
But we still keep going farther
Even if I take it back, and grasp it
If you're not the one
There will be no meaning
And so we'll go far off into the distance.

Oh, Sakura!
For crying out loud,how far have we walked?
The tower hasn't gotten a bit closer.
Here we can see itright in front of our eyes.
Strange...
No mistake about it.
It seems that we're already withinthe enthusiastic welcome.
Take a look at that.
Huh?
Oh, that can't be!
What on earth is going on?!
No way!
Is it Genjutsu...?
So it seems.We were lured in perfectly.
It appears we were meticulously careful,
and were made to walkaround the same place in a circle.
We're being watched...
Probably.
They intend to wear downour physical strength and
catch us unprepared whenwe're bone-tired.
If so, then this follows the enemy strategy.
Then.... They'll be coming soon.
Humph, they've appeared.
This is the perfect handicap.Believe it!
Clone vs. Clone:Mine are Better than Yours!
W-What is this?
It's quite a number.
Moreover, they're clones?
Cornered rats.
Shut up!
Oh, they're quite weak, huh?
Good!
Naruto!
W-What are these guys?
W-What's going on here?
I'll assess this!
Sharingan!
Naruto!
Sasuke!
Sasuke!
W-What's going on?
My body's...
Are you okay?
No mistake.
It's the real thing, not an illusion.
- Scroll please.- Scroll please.
That Kabuto was injured meansthese things are actual Shadow Clones?!
B-But...even though Shadow clonesare supposed to vanish
if they take a direct attack,these things don't vanish.
Does it mean then this is Genjutsu?!
Which is it?!
Scroll please.
Scroll please.
Give me scroll.
Dang it!
It's futile!
Stop!
These things are illusions.
It's an enemy Genjutsu.
B-But, Kabuto's wound is the real thing.
No, it's as Sasuke says.
Probably the enemy is hiding somewhere...
and coordinating their attack withmovements of the "Genjutsu Shinobis"
and attacking from a different location.
Pretending as if thoseGenjutsu Shinobis are attacking.
- Scroll please.- Scroll please.
Then I'll find the idiot who's behindthe scenes
throwing Kunai knivesand kick his butt, believe it!
Hold it, Naruto.
We've been deceived asto the source of the Kunai knives...
so we can't discover the preciselocation of the enemy like this.
Do you get it?
That is the enemy's purpose.
From a data standpoint, it's a typewho is weak at close combat
and Taijutsu that likesthis kind of attack.
The true enemy won't come outuntil we can't move at all.
Listen, everyone!
In any case,
all there is to do now is to fendoff the enemy attack.
Fine, if that's what their plan is...
Now then...I wonder how far they can hold out.
The night is long.
Man!This is endless!
Since it's come to this...!
Stop!
Naruto, don't waste your Chakra!
Even if you attack these things,there's no point!
If I hit them all ina single sweep,
the enemy won't fire inadvertentlywhile these things are reverting back.
The hiding place willbe discovered, so.
Shadow Clone Jutsu!
Shadow Clones?!
It's not over yet!
Sasuke, what should we do...?
Man, that loser.All there is to do is go for it!
B-But...
Indeed...
It's not a situation thathe can get through by himself.
Let's go, Sakura!
Y-Yeah!
I'm not finished yet...
Dawn is breaking.
It's finally time for the hunt.
Mubi, that's enough.
We're finished hunting their spirits.
Now what's left is just their bodies.
Lucky.
You're...the one who...did my left shoulder.
I finally found you.
You really hung me up.
Lucky.
I can finally even the score.
You... really hung me up.
Lucky.
I can finally even the score.
Heh!
Cornered rats.
It went well, Naruto!
W-What the heckare these guys?!
T-This can't be!
Since when...?!
Idiot!
You finally showed yourtrue colors, punk!
T-This brat, don't tell me...
The Shadow Clone is justthe preparation for the trick...
for me to portray every memberof the team by myself!
At the same time Narutolifted the Shadow Clone,
the three of us hid.
The Genjutsu users wereadversely deceived.
Naruto!
Naruto, you've used too much Chakra.
I'll do the rest.
No way! I'm not always going to havethe good parts taken away!
Is this really that Naruto...?
Since when had he improvedthis much?
That's some brat...
I can't believe he can still move.
Naruto...
Amazing Chakra stamina...
Right aftera Multiple Shadow Clone Jutsu...
a daring technique that transforms justthree of the bodies into his companions.
To think he can still moveeven after doing all that.
Here it's the fifth day now.
This kid will transform
if he can just masterthe use of his Chakra.
Not bad.
But we're still not unlucky.
There's no time.
This time around,we'll show you our Ninjutsu!
Ninja Art: Fog Clone Jutsu!
Shadow clones?
No, they are plain clones.
However, he's up to something.
Be careful!
Hah! If they are just clones,then there's one real body.
I'll kick their butts rightand left until I run into him.
You idiot.
Such a tactless thing...
I'm telling you!
I'm saying don't stick your nose in!
Naruto!
That's reckless!
Cripes!
From earlier, the nape of my neckhurts when I use the Sharingan.
Maybe I used too much Chakra.
Dang it!
Dang it. A clone?!
This one, too?!
This one, too?!
This one, too?!
Naruto! Stop!
Are they all fakes?!
Or could it be Genjutsu again?!
This is... the last...Chakra.
Sharingan!
Sasuke!
The bruise again...
Stop using the Sharingan, Sasuke!
It won't do to create an opening!
Kabuto!
Darn it!
Stop! Naruto!
No matter how muchyou swing at them,
the real body isn't in those clones.
Then where's the enemyattacking us from?!
If they are merely clones,the clones themselves can't attack!
If I knew that, we wouldn't behaving a rough time of it!
This is the enemy's scheme.
Man, I can't usethe Shadow Clone Jutsu anymore...
They've about reached their limit.
Lucky.
That's it!
The real body hides withthe Earth Style Jutsu
and attacks from behind a clone!
Kabuto!
Heh, "it won't do tocreate an opening," right?!
Thank you, Naruto.You saved me.
We're okay here, Naruto!
What happened there? Are you hurt?
That's a terrible bruise.
It's nothing.
Here it is, here it is!
Look, the Heaven scroll!
Good for you.
There's something about this guy...that I don't like.
Oh, it's you guys.
You're late, Kabuto.
I got a bit involved in something.
Sorry.
But, but...thanks to you, we got both the scrolls.
No, it's because you guys fought hard.
You were amazingat the end, Naruto.
We're going through this door.
Well then, I wish us both luck.
Yeah!
Yeah!
What of the harvest?
Yes.
More than I expected.
I filled in his entire datafrom this second exam.
You need this, right?
So, how was it?
Sure enough, it appears you're curious.
Master Orochimaru.
I want to ask your opinion.
As a Sound Village's spy...
That's not necessary, is it?
You will be the one to decide it all, so...
I like that cleverness of yours.
Good work.
There's nobody here.
I'm okay now, Sakura.
O-Okay.
That's too bad!
Cha!
Say-say, what're we supposed to do?
Oh! Look at that...
Without... Heaven...I don't get it at all.
If "Heaven" does not exist,
enrich your knowledge,and prepare for the chance.
If "Earth" does not exist,
run the fields in searchof an advantage.
Open the series ofHeaven and Earth,
and the perilous wayshall be redressed...
This is namely the secret of"the one that guides... "
What's that?
It looks like there are lettersor something missing there.
It's probably has to do with the scroll.
I think this means we're supposedto open the Heaven & Earth scroll.
Okay then, I'm going to open it.
Hey, can you hear it?
The clear, blue sky goes on and on
The ocean spans limitlessly
Please keep that smile on your face forever
Or else I'll cry
You won't have to search around you
It's all ok now.
Everyone is insidethis hand
when you want to cry,and you want to run away
When you forget what happiness is
Just sing.
Light is born, and darkness was born
The two are one
Harmonia, feel the telepathy
Hey, can you hear it?
What's this, what's this?
Here I thought that the reallystrong ones were remaining,
but Hinata, Kiba, Shikamaru,all of the Leaf Village rookies are here.
And that Lee's team, too.
So much for getting all inflated.
Well, I'm the man who's goingto become the Hokage.
I must impress them and
show that I'm not in the same classas any ordinary blockhead!

Sakura?
Why did you stopall of a sudden?!
The scents of Sasuke and the other two...are quickly moving away!
It smells like Sasuke ischasing those two people...
What?!
Sasuke is?
There are no other signsof movement.
But...
Let's not just stand around.Let's go after Sasuke right away!
But...what?
The people who are left are goingto fight each other.
We'll end up taking a little longer way...
but all there is for us to dois to avoid it.
Why?! If we do that, it'll only delay ourcatching up to Sasuke.
Let's just speed on through!
What are you saying, Naruto?!
We don't know what'll happenin the battle zone!
Even if we don't desire it,
there's a possibility thatwe'll be irrepressibly caught up in a battle.
That doesn't have anythingto do with it!
Kid! Our mission is to bringSasuke back.
So the cardinal rule is to avoid battleas much as possible until then!
- Let's go!- Got it!
Fine!
Puppet Master Jutsu!
I'm from the Aburame Clanof the Leaf Village...
When we fight,we never underestimate our opponent,
no matter what puny insectsthey may be.
I'll advance with full force!
Bring it!
Put me down, Temari.
Can you move, Gaara?
Gaara!
Kankuro is delaying Uchiha now.
We must use this opening...
If we don't get a move on,the operation will...
Huh?!
Temari, go over there.
What?
Just beat it! You're in the way!
Astonishing Truth!Gaara's Identity Emerges!
Poison on the blade!
I won't let you get away!
That's... Sasuke Uchiha!Did he get past Kankuro?!
No... No matter how you look at it,it's too soon.
Did another assailant come?
I don't know what you Sand Ninjaare scheming...
but I'll stop you!
And...
I'll ascertain your true identity!
Gaara!
Don't tell me...!
Is he going to rouse that thingin a place like this?!
This is no joke...It's out of my hands.
Stop, Gaara!Have you forgotten the operation?!
You who are strong...You who are called Uchiha...
You who have friends...
You who have a purpose...
You who are like... me!
By killing you...
I will exist in this world asthe one who destroyed all of that...
I can truly experience "life."
What is it?
It's so obvious if you releasesuch a blood-thirsty aura...
Come on out.
So it's you, eh...
What's your purpose?Why do you seek power?
It's none of your business.
Beat it!You're a hindrance to my training.
You...
have the same eyes as I do.
Eyes that seek power,brimming with hate and murderous intent.
You're like me.
Don't forget... You're my...
You're...
my...
You're... my...
my prey!
It's started...!
A Substitution?!
You're naive.
All right!
Insects?!
To think you'd makea clone out of insects and
wrap around behind me...
Not bad!
Your reach encompasses from mediumto long distance and you use a puppet.
I didn't think you woulddo well in close combat.
With that Puppet Master Jutsuwhere you have to concentrate
on the control of the puppet...
the one casting the Jutsu isprone to openings in defense.
You're very aware of the weaknessof a puppet master!
However, from here on,
I'll show you the essence ofthis Ninjutsu fighting style!
The real terror of Crow...my puppet of warfare!
This is Poison Smoke Bomb!
Did I inhale...a little bit?
I get it...And the caster of the Jutsu hides, eh?
Listen, everyone...
Even if enemy Shinobi appear,don't panic.
Go into the hidden room quickly.
Your Jonin and Chunin Senseiswill protect you all with their lives!
Oh!
Konohamaru...
It'll be okay!
Everyone's doing their best.
They can drive awaythe enemies right away.
Cracks in the face rockof the Hokage Lords...
How ominous...
Grandpa...
To have come this far...To have come this far...!
Do I already lack the powerto drag out his soul?
With this feeble body...
even though I'm prepared to die,is it not enough...?!
You probably could've killed meif you'd been ten years younger.
Sarutobi! If you don't kill him now,the village is doomed!
Do you understand?!
I... understand!
Useless... old man...
Now... Let me feel it!
That eye!
That eye...from before!
This doesn't look like it'll endby the time you come for back-up...
Shino...
It looks like the poison hasslowly started to circulate.
I'll finish this!
Insects, again?!
But he shouldn't be able tomove so much in that state...
I'll make things easier for you...
Hey! What's wrong?!
What's happening...?
Don't tell me...!
It's futile...He can't move anymore...
I had the beetles burrowinto every joint...
He stuffed beetles into its jointsso that the puppet can't move?
That was his aim from the beginning!
The beetles are passing throughthe threads of my Chakra...
Why...?
That's it!As I recall, their food is Chakra.
At this rate,my location will be found out!
He cut the Chakra threads himself...?
You got careless!
Instantly reattaching the Chakra threadsthat have once been cut
is simple for a first-rate puppet master.
And...
Crow is a puppet...
that has a weapon in eachand every component of the body!
It's a big mistake if you thinkthis has ended...
by your stopping my movements!
There's lots of poisonon the tip of the needle...
Die!
What?!
Just like that, the insects...!
The Chakra threads have beenbitten through!
What?! Why...?!
Where did these insectsspring out from?!
By beating away the bait insectsalong the Chakra threads,
you dropped your guard.
You didn't notice...the wriggling insects behind you.
The insects were movingthe whole time...
heading for your headband.
W-What did you say?!
The one blow earlier...
I pretended to miss andstuck one of those beetles on you.
But how did you know where I waswith one such beetle...?
I... hate explaining the same thing twice.
Shino?Why are you here?!
I put a female beetle on youbefore you left the arena!
The females have almost no smell...
Only a male can sniff outthe subtle smell of the female.
Then, this one beetle on my forehead...
Right... It's a female.
The poison has circulatedthrough my whole body, huh...
It looks like I won't be ableto go to back you up...
I'm sorry, Sasuke Uchiha.
Is he a... monster?
Are you scared of me, Sasuke Uchiha?!
Of my existence?!
Come out...Sasuke Uchiha!
You're... my...
prey!
Everyone makes mistakesIt's nothing to be ashamed about
Don't let this scar be for naughtWalk with a smile

What a speed and strength!
If I didn't use my Sharinganto foresee his movement,
I would have been in pieces!
But a merely defensive battlewill do no good.
What do I do?
How should I stop him?Do I need to use that...?
But Chidori may not...

A Dubious Offer!Tsunade's Choice
Not good...
Dang it! Dang it!This time for sure... no matter what!
You're the only one who can treatLord Orochimaru's arms.
Why don't we make a deal?
I'll resurrect the little brotherand man, both of whom you loved...
with the Forbidden Jutsu I've developed.
Don't you want to see those two,Tsunade...?
No! You must not believein their sweet talk...
Their wishes...Moreover, Tsunade, your wishes...
And dreams...Did you forget them?!
I'll be straight with you.
Tsunade, the village has demandedthat you become the Fifth Hokage.
The successive line of Hokages
have protected the Leaf Villageand those living in it.
They brought troubled times under control
and helped the village to prosper.
They risked their lives forthis dream, this ideal!
You don't have to answer right now.
However, I want it in a week.
Also, two human sacrifices areneeded for this Forbidden Jutsu,
so do what you need to doto prepare them.
We are starting!
C'mon. Place your bets!
Which will you bet on, ma'am?
Which one? C 'mon!
Which one will she choose?
If she agrees to our conditions,
your arms will be healed,
and the destruction of the Leaf Villagewill continue immediately.
Lady Tsunade will also be able tobe reunited with the two whom she loves.
But if she doesn't agree...
I'll have to force her to heal my arms...
Will it really be that easy?
I have you.
There's no need to worry.
I'm the one who knows her the best.
And her greatest weakness!
She'll definitely accept the conditions...Definitely!
Listen, in this third step,
you've got to use 100%of what you have learned...
And retain them.
In other words,
imagine creating a single layerwithin the balloon
and compressing the Chakra inside it.
I know that in my head...
But no matter what,
I can't completely hold 100%of my power in a neat ball...
Don't give him false hope by teaching himsomething he can't master.
That's why the moony kidstarts joking about becoming a Hokage!
Tomorrow, huh.
Come again, okay?
I certainly will!
Are you going to meetOrochimaru again?
To think she'd be that shaken up...
Something extreme must have happened.
That one week bugs me, somehow...
And Naruto hasn't come backto the inn for nearly a week.
I guess I'll press Tsunade a little more.
No good...
No good... Why?
Here there's no time...It'll be too late.
What's this...?!
What happened, Naruto?!
Are you okay?
What do you want?
The moon's out.
How about going out for a drink?
Tomorrow will be the one weekyou promised to Naruto.
I wonder what became of Naruto?
Beats me.
I guess I'll have something.
Radish, please.
Coming up.
Oh?
Here you go.
Ooh! This looks good.
Lady Tsunade!
What happened to Naruto?
He's quite exhausted and weakened.
And his right hand is severely burnedwith Chakra...
As it stands now,
this kid probably won't wake upuntil the day after tomorrow.
It's as Jiraiya says...
Why did I make such a stupid bet?
What am l, of all people,getting so worked up for?
How stupid.
Tomorrow...
Please don't go tomorrow!
Why don't you say anything?!
Lady Tsunade! Please don't be silent.Please answer!
If you say that you're going...
What will you do?
I'll stop you with my life!
Shizune... Have you forgottenwho you're talking to?
Sir! It's morning, now!It's about time you went home!
Geez.
Hey! Get up, sir...
Hey! What's wrong, you?!
It'll be troublesome if we're disturbedduring the negotiations...
What do you want me to do?
It might be good to kill...Tsunade's attendant.
It seems that you...
You don't trust me completely...yet.
Precisely because I trust you...
I would like to leave Sasukein your hands.
Well, then...
Kabuto...
If you wish to stop me...
You have no choicebut to kill young Sasuke, now.
You can't possibly kill me...
Hey!
I said hey!
Naruto...?
Oh no! What time is it?o, what day is it?
It's Monday...
What is it?
Is your body okay?
As I recall, you were supposedto sleep for two full days...
No matter what the wound,
I'm always able to recoverif I sleep one night!
That's right.This kid has Nine-Tailed Fox's power...
More importantly,where's that stupid old woman?!
Today's the promised bet day.
Then, what about the Jutsu...
It's still not complete, but I can wing it...Believe it!
That's right. This isn't the time for this.
- Naruto, please stay...- Huh?
You are...!
What?! Oh!
Wait, Shizune!
That darned Tsunade spiked my drink.
I can't build up my Chakra well...
And my body is so numb,I can barely throw a Kunai Knife.
What was he gonna doif that had hit me?!
That's lame! Here you're always braggingabout how you're this awesome Ninja!
And you're nailed by her perverted attack?You, Pervy Pervy Sage?!
Shut up!
Even if she's rotten,she's still a medical specialist.
She's the only one who could concocta tasteless and odorless drug for Ninja.
But to think I'd be caught off-guard,
no matter how intoxicated I was...
I'm going to kill you, bastard!
How are you feeling,Master Jiraiya?
Quite a bit better than this morning I guess.
But be that as it may,maybe around thirty percent...
I never thought I'd end up encounteringthat Master Jiraiya in a place like this...
Things have gotten difficult.I guess I'll pull back for now.
At any rate, Naruto...To think you'd be here, too...
Hey! Shizune.
Y-Y es?!
It's about time you tell me
what the heck she was talking aboutwith Orochimaru.
Orochimaru?!
I wanted to believe Lady Tsunade...
That's why I couldn't say until now.
But...
There's no time.Please come with me!
I'll explain as we run!
Okay!
I'm going, too!
What's your answer?
Say what?!
The answer to that is definitely no!
This might be really bad...
She's probably still thinkingof those two.
Perhaps I may have no choice,but to kill Tsunade...
Dang it!
I'll heal your arms...
In exchange for that,keep your hands off the village.
Very well.
Now then...
He's planning to once again attack
the Leaf Village ifhis arms are healed!
The situation will geteven more dangerous than that
if he's not stopped now.
Him screwing around like that!
I have you.There's no need to worry...
What's the meaning of this?
To think you'd betray me at this point...
Tsunade!
I believe your promise,its a true heart give me courage
Always I feel itthe precious time with you
On your still shoulder
I feel the wind that blowstowards tomorrow
The city lights are like pieces of stars
That hold us together
"Each one of us glows differently, "
you say laughingly
but you look most dazzling
Like a comet,
like the rainbow after the storm
You bring light into my heart
Being lost can be the answer
Let's promise we won't cheat
Uh...like a shooting star,we do go ahead.
What the hell is this?! This castlehas been destroyed even further!
It seems Tsunade hasdeclined the deal.
But... but the old lady is not here!
Calm down a second.She shouldn't have gone far from here.
Oh, some incredible noisefrom that direction, Pervy Sage!
Well, well... she started a flashy battle.
Naruto, we go after her!
Right! I'm ready anytime!
Next time:"Breakdown! The Deal is Off!"Yeah, turn your sadness into kindness, your uniqueness into strength

I won't... run...
I'll... stand by my own words...
That's my Ninja Way!
I'll...
stand...
by my own...
words!
That's my...Ninja Way...
I think I've heard that line before...
You with your destiny stuff...
I won't lose...
to a jerk with cold feet like you,no matter what!
Naruto...
A brat who knows nothingshouldn't lecture arrogantly!
People are born burdened withan inherent destiny that they cannot defy.
Neji...live...
You're a man who is blessedwith Hyuga ability
more than anyone in the family...
I wanted you...to be borninto the head family...
You can't possibly understand
the destiny of being burdened witha mark that cannot be wiped off for life!
Yeah...
I do understand it.
So...what of it?
This brat!
Don't be acting cool...
It's not just you who's special!
Hinata was also...suffering the same as you!
Even though she's the head family,not being acknowledged as such...
trying desperately to change herself...
She fought you while coughingup blood with that in mind!
You too!
The branch family thatprotects the head family...
Doing all that to Hinatajust because it's an exam.
In actuality, you were just as frantic
in attempting to goagainst destiny, right?
Vitality has returned to Hinata's face!
Just what I'd expect ofthe Anbu Black Ops...
She'll be okay.
Now she needs bed rest.
Your 64 Chakra Points are now shut...
How are you, who can't use Chakrafor awhile, planning to fight?
At the end of the day,
you and Miss Hinata havethe same destiny!
Shut up!
With your Byakugan, labeling peopleand talking like you understand!
Then... show me whether whatyou're saying is true or not.
I will! I'll defeat you no matterwhat and prove that to you!
Dang it... Dang it!
That being said, I don't feel Chakra at all.
It feels like when I used upmy Chakra in the training.
You possess two kinds of Chakra...
You must extract and utilize, at any time,
the other huge Chakra thathas rested inside you from the start...
That's it. The Nine-Tailed Fox Chakra...I'll use that...
Stinking fox...Help me out!
This is as far as the talking goes.
Proctor... I'm going to fight withthe intent to kill him!
If you're going to stop me,please feel free.
Jeez.
Didn't I tell you it is pointless?
This time, I really can't lose!
I'll win no matter what!
It's futile... I pressed the Chakra Points...
No matter what...
Oh, yeah! Be sure to comewatch me kick that Neji's butt!
A failure beats downa genius with effort...
His opponent might be me...
But even if that's you, Naruto,no hard feelings.
Why do you try to go againstyour destiny that much?
Because I was called...
a failure!
No, no way! Chakra is seeping out.
What's the meaning of this...?
H-He...!What in the world...?!
W-What is he...?!
It can't be... This Chakra!
T-That's... impossible!
No way! His Chakra Pointshave been pressed!
This Chakra...It's the Nine-Tailed Fox's, no doubt...
When did he masterthe Nine-Tailed Fox's Chakra...?!
Here I go!
It's twisting...
What's that?!Is that even Chakra?!
Awesome power.More so than during the training...
I feel it!
Rotation!
What?!
His speed's gone up!What in the world is going on?!
You!
You're confident in close combat, right?!
You're going to become the Hokage...?
I don't... think so.
Only a very small percentage ofinja are chosen to be the Hokage!
Look more at reality!
Those who become the Hokageare born with destiny.
It's not something you becomeby trying to become it.
It's determined by destiny.
People must live withintheir different respective currents
that can't be gone against.
I don't know what theHyuga destiny of hatred is!
But if you're going to say it's futile,you don't have to do anything!
This is bad! I must use the Rotation!
After I become the Hokage...
I'll change Hyuga!
What Chakra...
That kid showed some enormous strength...
The Hyuga kid is probably...
Say! Which one's Naruto?!
I don't know, either!
Neji's Rotation is a techniquewhere the body rotates,
and dodges andrepels the opponent's Chakra!
It looks like there wasmore damage done to Naruto
since he plunged right into the Rotation.
There's no Genin that can beat Neji...
But Naruto, you're incredible...
To think you'd force him this far...
Failure boy...Sorry, but this is the reality...
Now this is really the en...
My body...
So he left a Shadow clone in the holeand spotted a chance to win, huh...
Believing in victory,thinking about what's next
and acting even when gettingknocked around, huh...
The power of believing in oneself.
That becomes the powerto change destiny...
He knows this...And he's a natural to boot.
In those conditions,
you used the Shadow Clone Jutsujust like that...
The Ninjutsu that you're good at, huh?
I was careless...
I've...failed the graduationexam three times...
As luck would have it,
the Ninjutsu tests that appearedon the graduation exam were always...
infallibly the Ninjutsu I stunk at.
Clone Jutsu was the Ninjutsu...I stunk at.
Don't be whining about boring stufflike destiny and what not,
and how it can't be changed!
Because unlike me...you're not a failure.

Sasuke's movements have stopped!There's still quite a bit of distance, though...
So Sasuke caught up to him, huh?
Okay!
Huh? This smell is...?!
W-What's wrong?!
Did something happen to Sasuke?!
I didn't notice until now.
You...
use the same shampoo as me.
This floral green fragrance...o doubt!
H-Hey now...!
Well... my coat's shinier.
Don't be saying stupid thingsat such an important time!
- I'm the same as a dog?- Sorry, sorry...
Same as a dog... Same as a dog...
- Hey Sakura?- Same as a dog...
Same as a dog...
Same as a dog... Same as a dog...
Hey Sakura...!Wait!
Oh! Hey! Don't go ahead of me!
A Mistake from the Past:A Face Revealed!
Dang it!
Sasuke Uchiha!
I won't let you get away now!
Jeez, this kid of all people...at a time when Gaara is like this.
Man, this is bad.
Heh! That's fine.
Kankuro! Take Gaara and go quickly!
Leave him to me!
But Temari...!
No matter how you look at it,you can't beat him alone!
Leave me be!
This is an important mission forthe Village Hidden in the Sand!
Make Gaara the first priority!
Besides, he's quite my type of a guy...
Go! Kankuro!
I don't think so!
I won't let you get away!
Eat this!
My opponent is that Uchiha kid...
This is not good. I only havea bit of Chakra left.
I'll stand even less of a chanceif he uses his Sharingan here...
But I need to get him to usea large amount of Chakra at any cost.
Shall I take care of her inone hit with Chidori? Or...
In this situation, maybe I should...
As I thought... He's trying to savesome Chakra for Gaara.
Ninja Art: Wind Scythe Jutsu!
Don't underestimate me!
Ninja Art: Sand Storm!
Darn! I have to do something aboutthat bothersome fan...
Humph... I wonder how longyou'll last with such a way of fighting.
It can't be helped...
It looks like you've finallygotten serious, eh?
Fire Style: Phoenix Flower Jutsu!
That's the stuff!
Aim with precision!
Fire Style: Fireball Jutsu!
Did I get her?
Wind Scythe Jutsu!
I've got you.
Oh no!
Now!
You're mine!
Good!
W-What?! Substitution?!
Oh no!
Sorry, but I don't have the timeto be dealing with you forever!
D-Dang it...G-Gaara, at any cost...
What's that?!
What the heck is going on?
Who the heck is that youth?
Who on earth are you?!
Is it so sudden you can't tell?
It's me. Orochimaru.
It can't be... Have you completedthat Forbidden Jutsu?
I struggled for decades...after leaving the village.
You're a truly frightening,inhuman monster!
So, he did it, huh...?
The reason I couldn't select youto be the Fourth Hokage...
is because of that distortedconsciousness.
I've finally been found out, eh...?
It's too bad.
Orochimaru...What's the meaning of this?!
Here I'd set thatmany booby traps...
so I was quite surprised.
But I see... So it was you.
Recently, there has been a steady streamof people going missing from the village,
from Genin to Chunin,and even Anbu Black Ops members.
There was also information thatyou had been acting strange...
Master Orochimaru...
Why did a Shinobi of your rankdo such a thing?
Shall I kill you, too?
Orochimaru! Sure enough,this was your doing...?
Say it! What were you doing here?!
Alas! I've been found out.
There's no point in acting cute...
It's for Jutsu development!
Orochi... You!
For that purpose, you did thisto fellow Shinobi...?!
As I thought, Forbidden Jutsu, eh...
What is it that you want?
I want everything!
Everything, you say?!
Get every Jutsu and understandall of the truths of this world!
The one who first mixedblue and yellow
named the new color madein that way, green.
I just want to do the same thing.
If blue is Chakra, yellow is a Sign...
and green is a Jutsu.
In the same way that thereare no limits to the kinds of colors,
there are probably also tensof thousands of Jutsu in this world...
But in order to get anyand all of the Jutsu...
as well as the truths,a long time is necessary.
It's the one who takes thoselong years to know everything,
who can suitably be calledthe ultimate individual.
For me, the life span ofthe body is too short.
Too fleeting.
Even if I were to be called the Hokage,if I die, it all ends there.
Orochimaru... Could it be thatthe Jutsu you're testing here is...
Right... It sure could be...
Immortality Jutsu!
Immortality Jutsu is a technique of
eternally pooling one's ownspirits into this earth...
In other words,it's a Revival Jutsu where...
you find a new body, put your own spiritinto that body and take it over.
I assumed my old form until now,
so that you would feel nostalgicabout our reunion...
Aging is an empty thing, isn't it?
I feel that keenly when I look at you.
You'll die here...
and I'll get a younger,more beautiful and stronger body...
The Leaf truly lets me have my fill of fun...
I get it...You want Sasuke Uchiha, eh?!
Right... Exactly... Sasuke.
A Reviving Jutsu wheresomeone else's body is stolen
and the spirit is immortalized, huh?
How many faces and bodieshave you gone through?!
Two, I think...
I plan to take Sasuke over afterraising him a little more to my liking.
But after all, in order to make you regretyour very own life...
and curse destiny as you die...
... perhaps this face is better?
You monster!
Lord Hokage!
Don't lower your guard, Sensei!You're always too soft...
What's been wrong with you?This isn't like you!
I'm sorry...
Eyes...
Eyes with malice and ambitionconcealed in them...
I had noticed thatyou had such tendencies.
I had noticed,but pretended not to know.
It was still during the war-torn era.
A genius who brimmedover strongly with ability...
Nothing less than a phenomenonthat comes once in several decades.
So I wanted to think that
you would carry onmy own will and power.
That softness on my part...
created the conditions of that timeas well as now!
Are you going to... kill me?
Ninja Art: Summoning Jutsu!
I wonder if you can...Sarutobi Sensei!
Kill him, Sarutobi!ow's your only chance!
Sarutobi... You...
I couldn't kill him...
I'll bury you and correctmy old mistakes, now!
Here I go!
It's too late!
Shadow Clone Jutsu!
No way!Why the Shadow Clone Jutsu?!
To disperse the little Chakrahe has left...!
You've gotten old, after all...
To think you'd shorten yourown life span out of impatience...
D-Don't tell me, you...?!
Mi, I, Hitsuji, U, Inu, Ne, Tori, Uma, Mi...
This order of Signs...
I knew it, Sarutobi,you are using that Jutsu!
So this is the Grim Reaperthe Fourth Hokage was talking about,
which only the one who has signeda contract with this Jutsu can see, eh?!
Whatever you do now, it's too late...I've won.
The Leaf Village will crumble!
The Village Hidden in the Leavesis the home where I live.
The Hokage exists as the pillarto protect that home!
The Hokage is the one who inheritsand is entrusted the will of the Leaf.
I won't go easily!
Genjutsu! Infinite Darkness Jutsu!
Stupid nonsense...
You're merely a temporal head
in the history of the organizationcalled the Leaf Village...
Even the face rock that is leftwill eventually weather and decay.
Humph... Leaf Village isnot just an organization to me!
In the Leaf Village,
every year many Shinobiare born and raised...
and live and fight...and die to protect the village.
The people of this village...
even if they don't have blood ties...
To me, they are precious...
precious...
family!
Then I shall smash you, the pillar,and destroy the Leaf home.
Humph! Even if you kill me,that pillar will not break!
I am the man who carried on the Leaf Willof the First and Second Hokages...
The Third Hokage!
No matter how much you targetthis Village Hidden in the Leaves...
A new Hokage will carry on my will,shall become a pillar and defend the Leaf!
Right, Fourth Hokage?
Orochimaru! Now I will performan ace Jutsu that even you don't know!
Behold! Sealing Jutsu!Reaper Death Seal!
Everyone makes mistakesIt's nothing to be ashamed about
Don't let this scar be for naughtWalk with a smile
Yes, breathe in the airLift your face to the sky and jump
If it rains, take a breakGo where the wind takes you
So many regretsDon't let this scar be for naught
Let's go carve the badges in our chestYes, it's Show Time, life begins now.
Everyone makes mistakesIt's nothing to be ashamed about
Don't let this scar be for naughtWalk with a smile
Transform sadness into the windand continue to forge on
Forge on strong
Every year in this village,
Shinobi are born, nurtured,and fight for the sake of the village.
They live to protect the village andthings that are precious to them.
Even if they aren't related to me,they are my precious family.
I won't let you have your waywith my family!
Next time: "Forbidden Secret Technique:Reaper Death Seal!"Press down hard on the gas
That's right, there's no compromise
We'll slip through the night
At the final moment push hard
That's right, all the way to zero,
Until we wipe away the days
Gently open your heart
If you pull it close to you
It will reach you, without a doubt
It will come, closer
Now
We're speeding through life,squeezing it for all of its worth
Our feet are tied
But we still keep going farther
Even if I take it back, and grasp it
If you're not the one
There will be no meaning
And so we'll go far off into the distance.

Sakura Haruno vs. Ino Yamanaka
At this point in time,
I don't even plan to fightover Sasuke with you.
Sakura!
Do you know whoyou're lipping off to?!
Don't press your luck,crybaby Sakura!
It seems like...it seems like Sakura was out of line!
Ino's eyes show incredible anger.She's scary.
Hmm.
That's not it...
Huh?
Sakura's not the kind of kidto do things
like needlessly flaunt herown power and hurt people.
She doesn't like having Inotaking pity on her and pulling punches.
- This time for sure,- This time for sure,
- with full strength,- with full strength,
- a fair... fight!- a fair... fight!
The Ultimate Battle: Cha!
Just a Clone Jutsu...?!
This isn't a Ninja Academy'sgraduation exam!
You think you can beat me...
with a textbook ninja art?!
If I look carefully, I can find out,which is the real one right away...
Chakra to my feet at a burst...Then...
repel off the ground!
Fast!
If you think I'm the crybaby SakuraI was until recently,
you'll get your fingers burned!
Come like you mean it, Ino!
I appreciate you saying that...
I'll go like I mean it, as you wish!
Way to go Sakura!
Great!
Really great!
With the fundamental movementsusing Chakra,
she's topnotch among the rookies...
Huh?
Sakura is at her best.
That means...Is she better than me?
Well!
That's right.
Awww!
Sending Chakra all throughoutthe body and
using the techniquewith it at a right timing...
Those techniques aloneare better than Sasuke.
Well, from the start,she was extremely good at...
controlling her Chakra, so...
Magnificent movements, Sakura!
However, her opponent is good too.
This evenly-matched battlelooks to take awhile!
Since when did this girlget this strong?!
I can make it, too...!
You little...!
Whoa!
At this rate, it'll never end.
This is long...
They've been going at itfor ten minutes, at the least.
You shouldn't be evenlymatched with me!
What makes you thinkI'm evenly matched with you...
who's only concerned with looksand growing your hair frivolously?!
You!
You carry your mockingof me too far!
Idiot.
She's going for the bait.
Who knows what Ino will do!
I don't like Ino when she's that way...!
You're simple-minded...
Uh-oh.
She's totally lost it!
I don't need this!
S-Scary...
I'll put an end to this right now!
I'll make you say that you lost!
Hey, don't tell me...
Could it be...?
As I recall, that Sign is...
I knew it...
She's planning to dothe Mind Transfer Jutsu!
Man... That idiot!
I understand your feelings of frustration,but that's futile.
Humph!
I wonder!
Ninja Art, Mind Transfer Jutsu...
A Jutsu where the user can takeover the opponent's spirit
and wrest their body awayfor a few minutes...
by discharging all oftheir own spiritual energy
and striking the enemy with it.
But, there are major flawsto this formidable Jutsu.
First, the discharged spiritual energycan only fly straight and at a slow speed.
Second, even in the case of failingto hit the enemy and missing,
the user can't return to herown body for several minutes.
I should add that duringthat interval, the user's,
in other words, your main bodywill turn into a doll that won't move at all!
In the first place,
the Mind Transfer Jutsu is usedfor spying and is not a Jutsu for battle.
Ino, using that Jutsu herewould be equal to suicide...
It shouldn't be particularlyscary if she moves about...
And not only that,if she dodges the Jutsu,
she can beat the heck outof the non-moving opponent.
If that happens, Hayate will be forcedto put an end to the match...
So what?!
I won't know unless I try!
If you miss, it's over.
You know that, right?
In the first place,it's a combination Jutsu to be used
after stopping the opponent'smovements during a battle
with my Shadow Possession Jutsu.
There's no way!
There is no way, it will hit...
Idiot! Stop!
Ninja Art, Mind Transfer Jutsu!
Which one...?
That was unfortunate...
Ino.
Has the fat lady sung...?
She went and did it...
Then, it's over, eh.
This is...?!
You fell for it, Sakura!
I finally caught you!
It can't be!
Yes, it can.
My Sign weaving earlier was just an act,
to drive you who was runningabout into this contrivance.
So?
You can't move at all, can you?
It's special rope that's my hairwith Chakra poured in!
With this, it will be over whenI enter your body and say "give up!"
It wouldn't missa hundred percent of the time!
I see...
That idiot... Her losing itwas also an act?
Get out of there, Sakura!
I can't move...!
Then...
Mind Transfer Jutsu!
That was unfortunate...
She missed!
No!
Sakura...
Sakura!
Sakura!
W-What's with Ino?
Also... Sakura's acting kind of strange!Believe it!
But... surely this is her chance!
Do it, Sakura!
It's no use.
To think, the Mind Transfer Jutsu there...
Sakura's had it.
Mind Transfer...?!
That means Sakura right now is...
Yes.
Sakura's spirit has beencompletely taken over by Ino.
What?!
Ino is inside of Sakura's body now!
Well.
Ino's purpose is most likely...
With this, it's over.
Good bye, Sakura...
I... Sakura Haruno concede...
- this match...- No!
Sakura!
Tsk!
He's annoying!
You did your hardest to get here!
You'll disgrace women if you loseto that Sasuke-obsessed girl!
Like I said, those wordsare useless...
What's...
this bad chill...?!
Naruto is annoying!
Anyway, that's right...not to Ino I won't...
Sakura?!
This can't be happening...
What's the matter?
Are you conceding?
I won't be conceding!
No Way!
Cha!
Which is it?
W-What's going on?!
Sakura...?!
No way!
I messed up my Jutsu...?
Ino...You'll have a terrible time of itif you don't get out of me quick!
What's wrong, with Ino?
No... I won't hold on at this rate...
Release!
It can't be...She shattered Ino’s Jutsu!
She used too much energybefore the Jutsu...
So she didn't have enough Chakra...?!
To think she has two spirits...What are you?!
Strength that ranks with beauty.
Girls can't survive if they're not tough!
If caught in that spell,
it's not that easy to cast outthe invader...
Ino's lack of Chakra...
There's also that...
But what was more effectivethan that...
was the combative spirit towardsIno she has inside her heart.
So that was awakened with Naruto's voiceas the trigger and she cast Ino out...?
There's nothing to it.
Like Naruto...
Sakura's fighting spirit wasmuch stronger than others.
- This is...!- This is...!
But, both of them shouldhave hardly any Chakra left.
- This is...- This is...
- the end!- the end!
Both parties are unableto continue the match!
By double knockout,
no one gets through thefourth battle of the preliminary!
- What?!- Huh?!
Now then...
Good grief.
Hey, I no!
Sakura!
Sakura!
A-A-Are you okay?!
Treatment's not necessary.
They'll probably wake up after awhile.
But, that was surprising...
Yeah...
Naruto and Sasuke aside...
to think even that Sakura who didn'thave what it took has grown this much...
A lot happened,
but I really feel like itwas a good thing...
sending her to this Chunin Exam.
Tenten vs. Temari
Seeing that made me all fired up, too!
Now...
The second one from theLand of Sand, huh...
- This looks to be an interesting match.- Do your best, Tenten!
It looks like you finallywoke up, eh... Sakura.
Huh?!
Tenten, power of youth!
Go Go!
There is no limit to your youth!
Our match is already over.
Did I...lose?
I'm the one who wants to cry...
To think I tied with somebody like you...
Huh?
Here!
You also got a flower to bloom, didn't you?
A beautiful flower!
Ino...
However...
the next time we fight,
it won't end with yougetting knocked out!
Hm...?!
And... I won't hand overSasuke to you!
I return the same line to you!
- Humph!- Humph!
The fifth battle...
Tenten, Temari...come forward!
Hey, can you hear it?
The clear, blue sky goes on and on
The ocean spans limitlessly
Please keep that smile on your face forever
Or else I'll cry
You won't have to search around you
It's all ok now.
Everyone is insidethis hand
when you want to cry,and you want to run away
When you forget what happiness is
Just sing.
Light is born, and darkness was born
The two are one
Harmonia, feel the telepathy
Hey, can you hear it?
You know! You know!
I feel like women battlesare incredible, or...
Women are scary.
Huh?
Hey-hey!
This isn't the time to bewithdrawing, Shikamaru.
You're kind of a plain, or a lousy,or an unimpressive guy, aren't you?
If you don't really put your whole heartinto it, things will get hairy for you.

Where do you think you are going following someone else's map?
An insightful crow comes along to tear up the map
Now open your eyes and take a look at the truth (Yeah!)
There's nothing to lose, so let's GO!!!
We are Fighting Dreamers aiming high
Fighting Dreamers don't care what people think about them
Fighting Dreamers follow what they believe
Oli Oli Oli Oh! Just go my way
Right here right now (Bang!) Hit it straight like a line drive!
Right here right now (Burn!) We're gonna do it and do our best!
Right here right now (Bang!) Hit it straight like a line drive!
Right here right now (Burn!) We're gonna do it and do our best! BANG!
How is that your answer...Princess Tsunade?
To think you'd try to kill me...
At any rate,I have a sincere trust in you, Kabuto.
A trust for your loyalty and your eyesthat spotted Tsunade's attack.
Yes. We're both fromthe same medical corps so...
Her Chakra was overflowingwith violent intent.
Tsunade... I was really planningon resurrecting those two people.
And here I went so far as to promisenot to smash the Leaf Village...
Orochimaru...
I know that your promise of"not touching the village" was a lie...
Even though I knew that... I...
Just one more timewould've been fine...
Just one more time,I wanted to see them...
Just one more time...I wanted to touch them...
Just one more time...To see those smiling faces...
But...
the moment I felt thatrush in my bones...
that I'd be able to see Nawakiand Dan shortly...
I realized that I'm a hopeless fool!
Just by remembering those faces...
I become this blinded.
Big sister!
Tsunade...
I loved them...I truly loved them!
So, I wanted to see themand hug them in my arms!
But... I couldn't...
I won't lose the bet,no matter what!
Because of that kid...I remembered the dreams of the two.
Here I was trying to forget...
This village is grandfather's treasure!
I'm going to protect it!
'Cuz I'm the grandsonof the First Hokage
who built the Village Hidden in Leaves!
I love this village and my comrades...
So I want to protect them.
Right! Someday,I'll become just like Grandfather.
And the Hokage name will be mine!
Unlike you... I will be the heir tothe Hokage name, no matter what!
Since my little sister died,that sole thought has sustained me.
So I'll become the Hokage...
An existence that protects everyone...
- Becoming the Hokage is my dream!- Becoming the Hokage is my dream!
The precious dreams thatthey risked their lives for...
Making those dreams come truewas also my desire...
Things that have formedeventually decay... You said that.
But...
after all, these are feelingsthat won't decay...
So our negotiations have broken down...It can't be helped.
Since it's come to this, I have no choicebut to ask forcibly.
Breakdown! The Deal is Off!
Come! Orochimaru!
Come to think of it,
we've never gone at iteven once until now.
That's right!
What're you saying?
I'm the one who hasto go at it with her, right?
Now I'm going to killyou two worthless punks... here!
Incredible strength as usual...
It'll be over if you're hit once.
I can see that...
It's a bit cramped herefor fighting at a distance.
Are you going to change the location?
That would probably be better...
There was another troublesome personwith the Lady Tsunade's attendant.
That person may cometo her aid.
You're going down!
Who is...the troublesome person?
One of Sannin,the same as you and Lady Tsunade...
Jiraiya!
I won't let you get away,no matter what!
Wh-What's this?!
Huh... Princess Tsunade tore it up...big time.
This means that Lady Tsunade refused...
Where did old Tsunade go?
That belongs to Lady Tsunade...!
Tonton... Which way?
Okay!
It looks like you're quiteout of breath, too... Tsunade.
It's just about time.
I'm not that great at Taijutsu, but...
A Food Pill!
That Sign...!
This kid can also use Medical Ninjutsu...
He got my muscle...!
I severed, ever so slightly,
the bicep muscle of your upper armand the rectus muscle of your thigh.
Now you won't be able to releaseyour incredible strength.
A Chakra scalpel, eh...Why don't you target the arteries?
Indeed, with this scalpel,
I could cut the muscles and vesselswithout external injury.
But as may be expected,
I can't make a long, delicate scalpelin the middle of battle
that can reach the arteriesand the heart muscle.
But, even so...
there'd be no problem at allif I target the opponent's neck!
Dang it! My intercostals got hit.My breathing...
He's no ordinary Medical Ninja.
His Jutsu sense and his edgeexceed even me in my heyday!
It would still be troubleif you were to die on me.
I won't target your vital spot...
But with this, you can't move anymore...
She's amazing...
Ordinarily, one wouldn't be ableto budge due to difficulty breathing.
It looks like it will be necessaryto rough her up a little more...
but not enough to kill her.
Even though I'm trying to move my hand...
my leg moves?!
D-Don't tell me! This is...
You little!
In my present condition,
this seems to be the extent of my power...
I see...
It's... It's not the muscles...It's the nerves!
It seems you've realized...That's right. It's the nerves!
I changed Chakra into electricity...
made an electrical field andpoured electricity into your nerves.
The communication betweenthe brain and the body
is all done with electric signals...
Tsunade jumbled up all ofthe electric signals that are exchanged
at a velocity of 360 kilometers per hour.
Having left battle and yet such power...
So this is the legendary Sannin?
Healing-types use too much Chakra...
But in this condition...
If I try to move my right hand...
my left leg moves.
If I try to move my left ankle...
my right shoulder moves.
It's difficult...
But I've already grasped eighty percentof what moves when I move what.
Don't mess with me...
with this low-level...
Jutsu!
What?! In only a moment,his body movements...
You're scared of blood, aren't you?!
I'll show you plenty from now!
Jiraiya...?
It's been a long time... Jiraiya.
Orochimaru...
You've got an evil look as usual.
Huh?!
K-Kabuto?
Naruto...
I see... So you know each other?
We took the Chunin Exam together!
Why are you here, Kabuto...?
Get out of the way!
Hey...
I'll take...
these guys!
Just because you've masteredyour body movements...
it doesn't mean...
you can move like normal!
I won't let you get away now!
Too late!
My body movements havefinally returned...
Blood...!
Having two of the legendary Sanninas opponents is hairy, isn't it...?
So even if it's just one...I'll stop you!
Lady Tsunade!
Say! Say! What's happening?!
Why's Kabuto fightingwith old Tsunade?!
You're slow, Naruto...
That's why you're no match for Sasuke.
Take a good look at the headband!
He's Orochimaru's subordinate.
Wha--?!
That's right...
I was a spy fromthe Village Hidden in the Sound.
Wh-What're you saying?
You're lying, right, Kabuto?
During the Chunin Examyou taught us a lot...
And you also saved us.
Well, I wanted to gather dataon you guys.
Naruto, there's somethingI understood by gathering your data.
You have no Ninja ability.
Unlike Sasuke!
It's the first timeI've seen Lady Tsunade like this...
Please don't push it too far alone.
I'm your attendant, so...
Old Lady Tsunade...
Even with a fierce look,
you're just a cute Geninwho's a fish out of water.
Admittedly, I was anticipatingthe monster dwelling inside you...
But now,with the legendary Sannin before me,
you leave something to be desired.
You're just a puny zero.So if you meddle...
I'll kill you.
You little!
Don't, Naruto!
My body's still...
That hand...
He shouldn't be able to usethat right hand anymore.
Shadow Clone Jutsu!
I'll attack at once with four...
and break him from the right sidewhere he can't defend!
You little!
Okay!
What?
Blood?
Poison Needles!
My neural reflexes still haven'tcompletely returned!
I can't dodge completely!
With the headband...!
Good job, acting so quickly...
Thanks, Shizune!
That's...
A Plasma Pill!
A Plasma Pill?
So he's trying to replenishlost blood, huh...
That kid is a Medical Ninja same as me...
The blood is gushing out nicely,eh, Kabuto?
Lord Orochimaru...
Please take off the bandageon your left arm.
That man is Orochimaru...
At last, the real thing appears...
Shizune!
Y-Yes!
You take care of...that guy with the glasses!
I'll take care of Orochimaru!
I believe your promise,its a true heart give me courage
Always I feel itthe precious time with you
On your still shoulder
I feel the wind that blowstowards tomorrow
The city lights are like pieces of stars
That hold us together
"Each one of us glows differently, "
you say laughingly
but you look most dazzling
Like a comet,
like the rainbow after the storm
You bring light into my heart
Being lost can be the answer
Let's promise we won't cheat
Uh...like a shooting star,we do go ahead.
Enough already, you traitor!
Don't you dare touchOld Lady Tsunade again!
Hey Old Lady,just like our wager
I will definitely winthat unlucky necklace from you!
I won't run away!I won't give up!
Just watch.This is my Way of Ninja!
Next time:"Attack! Fury of the Rasengan!"Yeah, turn your sadness into kindness, your uniqueness into strength
Even if you get lost, let's start walking
One more time
Are you really happy
when you're always meeting to someone's expectations?
Even if you change to who you really wanna be
Will you always have a great smile?
Dreaming of only "the beginning," I wake up
and someday, I'll live on my own.
Yes, precious things are never in shape
You never know what it is when you get it or lose it
Yeah, turn your sadness into kindness, your uniqueness into strength
Even if you get lost, let's start walking
One more time

So what's up, Temari?
He's close. He's just right there.
Dang it! What should we do?
Leave it to me.
That was close.
What was that noise?
An explosion...Perhaps it was a trap set for Sasuke.
I wonder if he's okay.
Don't worry...He wouldn't get bumped off so easily.
I sure hope so.
Now then, shall we get started?
Before that, I must have you bothreturn to your original forms.
Please prepare yourself,Sarutobi Sensei.
An Unrivaled Match:Hokage Battle Royale!
With every moment,they are looking more lively...
What is that... Jutsu?
Reanimation.
It's a Forbidden Summoning Jutsuthat can bring the dead back to this world.
The cost of a regular Summoning Jutsuis that it uses the blood of the caster.
But I've heard that with this Jutsu,
in order to summona dead soul to this world...
the body of a living person is sacrificedas a container for the soul.
Then, the bodies of those twoare of the sacrificed...
Right...
Perhaps dust and dirt coverthe sacrificial body
and take on the original formof the summoned soul.
And by way of the charmembedded in the head,
the personality of the soul is killed
and it morphs into no morethan a killing puppet.
They're complete.
They look like how they usedto look more than ever.
Do you know the joy and senseof accomplishment
of hurting one whomyou once called Sensei?
I prepared this scenarioso that you might know that joy.
So please enjoy it.
Lord Hokage!
Even if the shape and formare the same...
they're neither the First Hokagenor the Second!
I...know!
Here I go!
Fire Style: Fire Dragon Flame Bombs.
Water Style: Water Wall.
No way!
To be able to set into motion that levelof Water Style in a place with no water.
I can't believe it.
T rue to the title of the previous Hokage.
Water Style: Water Shock Wave!
Earth Style: Mud Wall.
Same mighty strength as always.
Having two of you is quite a challenge,as might be expected...
This is bad.
This is a Hidden Jutsu of the First Hokage.
Hidden Wood Style Jutsu:
Deep Forest Emergence.
His Chakra became a source for life.
Wow... So this is the legendaryWood Style Ninjutsu of the First Hokage
who brought turbulent times under controland built the Leaf Village.
You're finally caught...eh, Sensei.
Okay. Everyone's here, right?
Okay everyone, let's evacuate quickly.
Don't rush and don't panic!
What's the matter, Konohamaru?
Does your stomach hurt or something?
No...it's not that.
Ninja Art: Summoning Jutsu.
Appear!
Monkey King Enma.
Humph...Something pesky has appeared, eh?
Old Monkey Enma.
Orochimaru...I knew this would happen.
You're pathetic, Sarutobi...It's because you didn't kill him back then.
I'm going to do it now!
It's too late.
Please... Enma!The Adamantine Nyoi.
Take care of him.Don't let him transform into that!
Okay... Got it!
Transform!
All right.
Wow... What level of Ninjutsu battle!
This is Hokage level!
Oh well...Things have finally gotten interesting.
That's one of his Snake Swords.
Let's do it, Enma!
No matter how strong the body,the Snake Sword still hurts.
You're mine!
Lord Hokage!
So foolish...
To think you'd strike without evenusing the Shadow Clone Jutsu.
No, that's not it.
It's not that he didn't use it.He can't use it.
The amount of Chakra the Third Hokagehas differs from the past.
The Shadow Clone Jutsu thatevenly disperses Chakra,
if things go wrong,would be like throwing away Chakra.
Sure enough, is it age?!
Are you okay, Sensei?
Please hang in there.
You are called...
"the Professor who knows and uses allof the Jutsu existent in Leaf Village," right?
Please don't disappoint me too much.
Please get up, Lord Hokage...!
And please save the Leaf Village!
Lord Hokage!
Fool... It is too late.
Sarutobi, what's wrong?
You're not your usual self.
It's as if you're good for nothing...What are you hesitating for?
Now's the time to draw the line.
Orochimaru...
You...fool!
Orochimaru...
This is the end.
I'll snap your neck.
As I thought...
It looks like there's no point ifI don't do something about the soul itself
that is bound by the Reanimation.
If so, all I can do is to use...the Fourth Hokage's Jutsu.
Lord First Hokage, Lord Second Hokage,please forgive me for using that Jutsu!
Sensei... it seems you're out of breath.
You've gotten old, haven't you?
I've never seen such a pained look.
What's so funny?
It's quite sad...
Old age beats even you,once renowned as the god of Shinobi.
What's that...?!What the heck is going on?
Who the heck is that youth?
Who the heck are you?!
Is it so sudden you can't tell?
It's me. Orochimaru.
It can't be...
Have you completed thatForbidden Jutsu?!
You're a truly frightening,inhuman monster!
I finally caught up.
This is as far as you guys go.
Dang it!
Sasuke Uchiha.
I won't let you get away now.
Everyone makes mistakesIt's nothing to be ashamed about
Don't let this scar be for naughtWalk with a smile
Yes, breathe in the airLift your face to the sky and jump
If it rains, take a breakGo where the wind takes you
So many regretsDon't let this scar be for naught
Let's go carve the badges in our chestYes, it's Show Time, life begins now.
Everyone makes mistakesIt's nothing to be ashamed about
Don't let this scar be for naughtWalk with a smile
Transform sadness into the windand continue to forge on
Forge on strong
Orochimaru...
a genius Ninja who appearedduring the war-torn era
and one of a kind in decades.
I wanted to believe that this individualwould succeed my strength and will.
But my naivete created this situation.
I will bury you now andcorrect my old mistake.
Next time, "A Mistake from the Past:A Face Revealed!"Connecting old words that have been used up
I just want to convey my simple thoughts
That day's faint wind blows away
at the castle ruins of yesterday
I'll laugh with you and live for the moment
Still that incident will continue to trouble you, right?
That's why it must be good-bye
Leaving nothing behind, let us share what is left
In time, we'll realize that it was everything
And sadness will touch our cheeks, creating a river of tears
Trembling thoughts swept into a vortex and melting away

Let's have fun!
Good grief... This is too much for...a pre-celebration.
Did you take care of the business?
Y es...
More importantly,the rain's starting to let up.
Shouldn't you quickly put an endto this farce of a race?
Fine.
Guess I'll go for a run!
A-Above here, huh?
Yeah...
It's a quite a long staircase,believe it.
They're also calledthe Stone Steps that Tear Hearts Apart.
Heh, cool!
Let's go at a sprint!
Hey, he's kidding, right?
What kind of stamina does he have?
Boss.
It seems Idate is heading this way!
He hasn't run away,just like you said, Boss.
Of course...
I saw potential in him.
Now, it's just a little more!Run Idate!
A Fierce Battle of Rolling Thunder
Hey... you...!
Huh?
Let me tell you...
It's not like I trust youor anything yet, okay?
Yeah, yeah whatever.
It doesn't really matter to me,believe it.
There's a personwho still trusts you, right?!
During the Chunin Exam...
Huh?
You said that a tenth problemappeared, right?
Yeah. It was a weird problem to determinewhether you'd take the problem or not.
Three years ago...
I got a similar problem...
Okay, now I'm going togive the tenth problem.
The tenth problem...
What kind of problem isBig Brother going to give?!
The tenth problem is a battle
with the Three-Man Squadyou were teamed up with.
The three of you will compete againsteach other this exercise.
And among you...one of you will be failed!
And the one who is failedwill remain a Genin for life
and we will never againlet them take the Chunin Exam!
N-No way...
Then for what purposewere we together until now?
I make the rules here.
Back-talk is not allowed at all!
If you want to withdraw,you should do so.
Withdrawing here andwaiting half a year is also a way.
If one person amongthe three withdraws,
of course all three memberswill be disqualified.
But you will be allowedto take the Chunin Exam
one more time, in half a year.
So, what will you do?
One comrade will be dropped.
I have the confidence to pass.
But, one of them will remaina Genin for life.
It's a choice betweencomrades and your life.
If you're going to quit,now's the time.
Is there nobody elsewho's going to withdraw?
We're good, then.
Okay, to everyone whohas remained here...
I render you disqualified!
Wh-Why...?
H-Hold on a minute!
I prepared myself and remained here!
Such preparedness is below contempt!
Scums like you don't havethe qualifications to become Chunin!
That's all!
I see...
What kind of a test was itfor you guys?
I forgot...
I mean, it was explained to me,but I didn't really get it.
Trusting in my big brother's words,I remained in the classroom.
And yet I was failed!
No way could I take that.I questioned my big brother.
Big Brother!What's up with that test?!
A Shinobi reads the double bluff.
You should've understoodthat was the test.
Even so, I can't accept that!
No matter how dangerous,
isn't it necessary to havethe courage to plunge into any mission?!
Idate.
Can you really not accept it?
Of course not, such a...
You...quit as a Ninja.
If you're telling me to quit,then I will.
But tell me why I'm no good!
That's something you shouldrealize yourself,
with your own power.
To this day... I don't understandthe answer to that.
So after that,you were deceived by Aoi, huh?
Yeah, that's right.
We made it...to the top!
I'm going by myself from here.You rest!
Huh?! You still saying stuff like that?!
I can't be asking you guysto help any more.
There's no point if I don't win by myself,on my own strength!
Oh... hey! Idate!
I can make it! It seemsSakura's special medicine has worked!
Blast!
This doesn't hurt!
I'm back in the game...from here!
If we cross this suspension bridge,it's Ouzu lsland, huh?
We should hurry.
It seems Idate has made itto the Modoroki Shrine.
What?!
It seems we underestimatedthe Leaf Genin a bit...
You jerk!You didn't finish them?!
Now's not the time to be talkingabout stuff like that.
Please cross the bridge quickly!
Useless Ninja!
Hey! I'm only helping youbecause it's the job.
I'll waste you if you keeptalking smart to me.
I-I'm sorry...
If you've understood,then get a move on!
Y-Yes!
There he is! That Fukusuke jerk!
This is quite something.
I never thoughtyou'd make it this far.
That's the...Blade of the Thunder God!
Stop!
Stop!
Stop kicking a dead horse.
Nobody is a match forthe legendary Blade of the Thunder God,
said to have been usedby the Second Hokage.
You should know this well.
After all, you're the manwho stole this for me.
Blast...
Mud balls, huh?It's just like a kid's fight.
Sorry, I didn't haveany Kunai Knives.
Naruto...
But you won't be able to dodgethe next ball just with that.
Shadow Clone Jutsu!
He's concentratingthe Chakra in his palm.
Here I come!
Here I come!
Once more!
I don't know whatyou intend to do, but...
Ninja Art: Senbon Rainstorm!
Too bad.
This Blade of the Thunder Godcuts through anything!
Even Chakra itself is no exception.
Naruto!
I have to make doubly sure
so that nothing troublesomewill happen again.
I'm your opponent!Keep your hands off Idate!
Humph, are you stillsaying such things?
Saving each other, protecting each other,trusting each other.
It ticks me off!
The weak can't surviveif they don't support each other.
So they trust people easilyand are betrayed.
Weaklings like you guysshould just run about and away.
Right, Idate?
It was like that alsowhen you stole
this Blade of the Thunder God, right?
I can see it.That's the Village Hidden in the Rain.
Aoi Sensei?!
Aoi Sensei!
Idate...
B-Big Brother...
You idiot!
Go back to the village immediatelyand surrender yourself!
You?!
Do you know whatyou have done?
What?!
Strict as always, eh?And he's your cute little brother.
But it's truly perfect thatyou've shown up here.
Aoi Sensei...
This forbidden Jutsu scrollcan't be deciphered
unless you're Jonin class.
I'll have the brothersbetray the Leaf Village together.
Ibiki, please decipher it already.
I refuse.
So are you choosing death,together with Idate?
Such as he is,he's also a Shinobi.
He's not afraid of death.
It doesn't seem so.
This face is one taut with fear.
I'm quitting as a Ninja!So please don't kill me!
Please decipher it.
You don't want to seeyour cute little brother killed
before your eyes, do you?
Little brother, you say?
That fool?
Big Brother...
Such a threat means nothing to me.
Hey, Ibiki, is the Village Hiddenin the Leaves that important?
Even if you protect it atthe risk of your own life,
you're nothing but a pawn!
So that's whyyou became a traitor?
You're a pathetic man!
You punk!
Idate!
You, run away!
What about you, Big Brother?
I'll go, after I clean upthe mess here!
I don't think so!
Big Brother!
Go, quickly!
But Big Brother...!
Go! Having you stay is a burden!
I won't let you!
Go!
So appalling...
that he'd riskhis life for such an idiotic guy.
All you could do after thatwas run.
You could've returnedto the village and called for help.
But you didn't do that.
Thinking Ibiki was deadwas no excuse!
The fact is, he was alive...
In that regard,Ibiki was admirable.
Not only did he completely endurerepeated interrogation,
but he also retrievedthe Forbidden Jutsu scroll...
without having confessed to anything!
And to think that he didall this
for his good-for-nothing little brother.
You betrayed your village,abandoned your older brother,
and came to think of only yourself.
Even Ibiki who is blood-relatedand risked his life to save you,
you didn't trust him!
Afraid of being accused,
you didn't trust the Village Hiddenin the Leaves, your birthplace...
You trust nobody.
You're not trusted by anyone.
For me, there is no pupilas excellent as you.
As a reward,I'll let you die in one instant.
Idate!
Sasuke... Sakura!
Rest, Naruto!
I'll beat this guy!
Don't be acting cool, believe it.
You can't beat me, no matterhow many people show up.
Me, Aoi Rokusho,
the Rain Jonin who possessesthe Blade of the Thunder God.
Is that so?
Interesting.
The Blade of the Thunder Godand my Chidori!
Let's test which is better!
The rumors were true.
The survivor of the village's honorableUchiha Clan...
is just a good-for-nothing kid...
Sasuke!
Run, Sakura!
He'll show no mercy,no matter who the person is.
Everyone will be killed!
No way!
Huh?!
We'll protect you,no matter what.
We promised that, didn't we?!
Trust us!
Now all that's left isthe wounded rabbit
and the excellent pupil, huh?
You two together,go to the next world.
Take it back!
Take it back!
What're you talking about?
What you said...
earlier!
Don't mess...
with the Uchiha...
with me!
Why you--!
Sasuke!
Sasuke! Get up!
How very cold the bottomof the ocean must be.
Stop!
Idate!
Sakura!
Sakura!
Once in a long while, once in a while
The remnants of a personbroken by dreams
Look like a mountain
Clinging to the Divine,clinging to Buddha
The remnants of a person crying
Look like a mountain
Rendezvous with a happy dance circle
This is my victory pose, round and around(round around)
Shake shake shakeLet's look
With a bye-bye rhythm that never ends
Look like a mountain
Look like a mountain
Look like a mountain
Look like a mountain
What the heck should we do?
That sword of the Second Hokagewon't budge an inch
even with Sasuke's Chidorior my Rasengan!
But I can't lose this battle.
I won't run away, no matter what!
If my techniques aren't going to work,I'll just have to keep trying!
Next time: "The Last Leg:A Final Act of Desperation"Yeah, turn your sadness into kindness, your uniqueness into strength
Even if you get lost, let's start walking
One more time
Are you really happy
when you're always meeting to someone's expectations?
Even if you change to who you really wanna be
Will you always have a great smile?
Dreaming of only "the beginning," I wake up
and someday, I'll live on my own.
Yes, precious things are never in shape
You never know what it is when you get it or lose it
Yeah, turn your sadness into kindness, your uniqueness into strength
Even if you get lost, let's start walking
One more time

Hey! Open up!
Huh?
What's all this noise at this hour?
Idiots! I told you not to letyour eyes off him, didn't l?
Could Gaara have...?
Where on earth did he go?
I hope nothing bad happens, but...
Hospital Besieged:The Evil Hand Revealed!
Wow, he's sound asleep...I wonder if he's dead?
If that's for Sasuke,he's not back yet.
Hmm.
Ino...
I'm way ahead of you onSasuke information.
Missed your chance on that one,eh, Billboard Brow?
No! This is for Lee!
Huh?
The one from before shouldbe wilted by now too...
Oh.
Lee! Stop it!
191...
Don't touch me!
I'm...not...done yet...
Here.
Thanks.
I hope Lee's better.
Yeah.
Huh?
What the...?
Oh man, it's all clogged up.What a drag...
Yo!
You finally woke up, eh?
Where... am l?
In the hospital!
They told me that you've beensound asleep for 3 days and 3 nights!
Three days...
Three days and three nights?!
W-What?
Shikamaru! When doesthe final competition start?
T-Tomorrow.
What?!
Why didn't you wake meup earlier!
I can't be just snoozing throughin a place like this!
And what about Pervy Sage?
Where's Pervy Sage?!
I've got to have him watchover my training.
Huh? What are you talking about,all of a sudden?
I don't know what's got into you.
Huh? My clothes are missing!
Where are they?Where, where?
- Sleeping away like you're in a coma,- Gone!
- then running around out of control.- Where're my clothes?!
Settle down a little!
You know what?It isn't gonna make a difference
if you rush aroundone day beforehand.
Resting is training, too, you know...
Huh? Hey... Naruto.
What in the worldis going on?
I'm... so... hungry....
Don't keep scaring me like that...
Oh yeah.
It's such a drag but...
I bought this fruit basket asa get-well present for Choji.
But the doctor said he couldn't have it.
So let's eat it together.
Choji? Is he that sick?
No, no, don't be fooled.
He got sick from eatingtoo much BBQ.
That's just like him!
Yeah well, and neither of you are the typeto have female visitors.
So here...
Looks good.
W-What is it?
Since Choji can't have any,let's eat in front of him.
What a drag this guy is!
Huh?
No one's here.
Out to lunch?
Oh well...
Okay!
Hmm?
Lee, I'm putting theflowers here, okay?
I'm still hungry!
Are you harassing me, Shikamaru?
Oh yeah.
Why...save him?
He's an important subordinatewhom I care for.
My body... isn't moving.
You jerk!
What the hell do you thinkyou're doing?!
Hey Naruto...
During Shadow Possession Jutsu,it's moving me too! Okay?!
Sorry! Shikamaru.
What the hell were youtrying to do?
Choji, are you better?
Oh, Ino!
All right! The age ofthe chubby has arrived!
What were you trying to doto Bushy Brow here?!
I was trying to kill him.
What?!
How can he be so calm?
Especially when he is not able tomove with my Shadow Possession Jutsu...
Why'd you have to do somethinglike that?
You beat him in the match, right?
Do you have a personal grudgeagainst him or something?
I don't have anything like that.
I just wanted to kill him, that's it.
How can you say somethingso selfish, you bastard?!
You...you had a lousy upbringing,didn't you?
All you care about is yourself.
Or there's something weird about him.It gives me the chills!
If he tries anything, it'll be too muchof a burden for me and Naruto...
What the heck should we do?
If you get in my way,I'll kill you both too.
What?! Go ahead, if you can!
Hey Naruto, hold on!
Should I try to scare him with a bluff?
I know you're strong from seeing youin the competition with him...
But... we can keep up with you.
We didn't show you our best skillsin the preliminaries.
And it's two against one!
You're the one who's at a disadvantage.
If you're smart, you'll do whatI tell you and just get lost.
I'll say it again...if you get in my way...
I'll kill you.
Where the heck do you get off...?!
There's no way in hellI'll let you do that!
I've been telling youto back off, haven't l?
This guy has the strength of a monster.You get it, don't you?
I have a real monster in me!I'm not going to lose to this guy!
Huh?
I heard Naruto was here too,so I came to see, but...
What a mess...
Well, I guess this means he's okay.
Huh?
What's worth making him mad,you idiot!
A monster, huh...?
Me too, actually.
It's just like you said.I had a terrible upbringing.
When I came into this world,
I took the life of the womansome might call my mother.
So that I could becomethe strongest Shinobi...
my father brought hisinjutsu upon me,
and so I became possessedby a Sand Spirit.
I was born a monster.
A Sand Spirit?
It's called Shukaku, the living wraith ofan old monk
from Village Hidden in the Sandwho was sealed inside the tea cauldron.
It must be a type ofcacodemon possession Jutsu,
performed to a baby before it is born.
To go that far...they must have been totally nuts.
Is it possible...that there could besomething inside him too?
What a thing for a parent to be doing!Such a twisted kind of love.
Love?
Don't measure me by your standards.
Family, huh...
Let me tell you what kind of tiesI have to my family.
They're ties of hatred,ties of murderous intent...
My family's just lumps of flesh.
Nourished with the life of my mother,
I was crafted as theultimate masterpiece of the village...
The Kazekage's child.
I was taught by my fatherthe innermost secrets of the Shinobi...
spoiled, over-protected,and left on my own.
And I thought that was love...
Until that incident happened.
That incident...?!
What are you talking about?
Just what happened?!
In the six years since the timewhen I was 6 years old...
My real father has tried to assassinate memore times than I can count!
But I thought you just said thatyour father spoiled you...
What's going on here?
Those who are too strong areapt to become feared.
Born through the Jutsu,my mind was unstable...
I guess the idiots in my village
finally realized thatI had emotional problems...
For my father, Kazekage,
at the same time I wasthe ultimate weapon for the village,
I was also a dangerous,fearsome presence.
It seems I was labeled a dangerous figureas soon as I turned six.
And I was treated politely simply becauseI was feared.
To them, now I'm just a relic of the pastthat they want to see disappear.
So what did I have in this life,why did I keep living?
When I asked myself that,I couldn't find the answer.
But, as long as you're alive,you need a reason...
If you don't have one,it's just the same as being dead.
What's this guy saying?
I...can understand that...
He...is the same as me.
So this is the answer I came to...
I am living in order to killhuman beings other than myself.
After living in the fear of never knowingwhen I might be murdered,
finally I became calm.
By killing assassins, I finallycomprehended the reason why I live...
I live fighting for only myselfand loving myself...
And if I see that all other peoplein this world exist
only to make me realize that,
there could be no worldmore wonderful.
And as long as there areothers to kill
who can make me feelthis happiness to be alive,
I will never disappear.
W-What's this freak talking about...?
He's real gone!
I was also alone...
And suffered 'causeI didn't know why I was alive...
But Iruka Sensei recognized mefor who I was...
and that was the first timeI realized why I lived...
But this guy...this guy grew up alone.
And he only feels alivewhen he kills other people.
H-How can there be someone like this?
The worlds we live inare too different...!
There's no way...that I can beat a guy like this!
W-What's wrong, Naruto?
What? Shadow Possession Jutsu shouldhave stopped him from moving, but...
Naruto!
Naruto! Hey, get yourself together!
What a drag this guy is!
Naruto!
Now, let me feel it...!
Oh no!
Stop right there!
Tomorrow's the final round!
There's no need to rush like this!
Or do you just want tostay here starting today?
Don't leave me alone!
I'm not bleeding, butit hurts a lot right here.
What...am l?!
I will... kill you all without a fail.
Just wait.
One! First, Tyson jumps and slamdunks
Two! He kisses and hugs everyonerandomly and says "l LOVE YOU"
Three! Masala masters Yogabut hates curry
Four! Sanchez is a lousy bullfighter. Ole!
All over the world, the sky's smiling,so look up and smile too
Oh yeah! Oh yeah! Oh yeah!Fight! Fight! Fight!
One! Bodimahattaya-san devoteshis time for digging black ships
Two! Peking Duck, Action Scene,Chen Lee speeds around on his bike
Three! Popo loves to polish his Coteka
Four! Japanese people,now lend me you hand!
All over the world, the sky's smiling,so look up and smile too
Oh yeah! Oh yeah! Oh yeah!Fight! Fight! Fight!
All over the world, the sky's smiling,so look up and smile too
Oh yeah! Oh yeah! Oh yeah!Fight! Fight! Fight!
Hey! Konohamaru!How could this be the ace route?!
I'm already late!
And you're making me laterby taking a longer route to get to the field!
The final competitionwill start anytime now.
Darn it!Hurry! Hurry! Hurry!
Run, run, run, run!
Next time, "The Final Rounds:Rush to the Battle Arena!"
I can't trust your "ace" route at all!Press down hard on the gas
That's right, there's no compromise
We'll slip through the night
At the final moment push hard
That's right, all the way to zero,
Until we wipe away the days
Gently open your heart
If you pull it close to you
It will reach you, without a doubt
It will come, closer
Now
We're speeding through life,squeezing it for all of its worth
Our feet are tied
But we still keep going farther
Even if I take it back, and grasp it
If you're not the one
There will be no meaning
And so we'll go far off into the distance.

It's a custom where balance is preservedby fighting and removing life.
This is the friendshipof the Shinobi world.
This is a fight for life with the prideof the village and
one's own dream on the line.
Heh, I'm convinced.
Anything is fine.
Just tell us the contentof that fight-for-life test.
Very well.
Now then, this is where I'dlike to explain the third exam.
But actually...
Please allow me, Hayate Gekko who wasgiven the task of judge, to speak first.
I leave it to you...
There's something... I'd like you allto do...
before the third exam.
And that is a preliminaryto the third exam,
with participation inthe main battle on the line.
Preliminary?
What do you mean... preliminary?!
Sensei, I don't understandthe point of that preliminary.
Why aren't we doing the next examwith the remaining test-takers?
This time around,
perhaps because the first andsecond exams were easy,
there are a few too manypeople left, you see.
In accordance with the rulesof the Chunin Exams,
a preliminary will be held in order toreduce the number advancing.
N-No way!
As Lord Hokage said before,
many guests will be comingto the third exam.
So we can't have long pointless matchesand our time is limited as well.
Therefore, those of younot in top physical condition...
Hey, is he okay...?!
The teacher doesn't look well himself?!
Excuse me.
Those of you who wish to drop out,please speak up now.
The preliminary willbegin immediately, so...
Immediately, you say...?!
But we finally made it throughthe second exam.
This is a pain...
Huh? What about our meal?
Narrowing the Field:Sudden Death Elimination!
Okay!
I'm going to do my best, no matter what!
I promised Kabuto, too...
And oh...
I forgot to mention this, but it willbe individual battles from now on.
It is your decision, so feel freeto raise your hands and drop out.
Who's going to quit?!
Sasuke?!
The waves of pain arecoming faster...
Sasuke... I knew it.
Sasuke, you should quitthese preliminaries!
Huh?!
L-Look, you haven't been yourself
ever since you got workedover by that Orochimaru guy!
That bruise hurts even now, right...?
Bruise...?
At this rate...!
I gave him a parting gift.
Sasuke will definitely seek me...in search of power.
You're the only one left.
Please...
Please, quit!
I'm...scared.
Sakura...
I knew it.
What shall we do?
We should remove himfrom the exams
and isolate him withAnbu bodyguards on him.
We should recommend thathe retire immediately.
He's not the kind of type tojust obey like that...?!
After all, he's of the Uchiha clan.
What're you talking nonsense for?!
I'll make him stop, by force if needed!
The Curse Mark responds evenwhen one's just building up Chakra
and attempts to forciblyextract his strength!
It's a prohibited Jutsu that eatsinto the body of the one who uses a Jutsu!
It's a wonder that kid is even enduring it.
He should really already be dead!
Lord Hokage!
You're in no condition tofight properly, Sasuke...!
Shut up.
I understand!
Be quiet!
But you've been enduring the painthis whole time, right?!
Please be quiet!
No matter what you say, Sasuke...
I'm going to tell the teachersabout the bruise!
If I do that...
Well...
Oh...?!
What...?
Excuse me... I'll quit.
K-Kabuto...?
Let's see...
Kabuto Yakushi ofthe Leaf Village, correct?
Then, you may step back.
Okay.
Kabuto!
Why're you quitting?!
Tell me! Why?!
This guy...
I'm sorry, Naruto...
But my body is worn out.
Actually before the first exam...
when I wrangled withthe guys from Sound Village,
I've had no hearing at all in my left ear.
To fight right away...
and to be told that my life wouldalso be on the line, I can't go on.
I've seen that face a few times.
As I recall, I think he dropped outof the main battle before, as well.
What in the world is he thinking?
Anko.
Uh...yes.
Kabuto Yakushi.
According to the data,he has failed six straight times.
What about his background?
From his time at the Academy,
he was a student who didnot really stand out,
and his grades were ordinary.
He finally passed the graduationexam on his third try.
After that, as for the missionshe carried out,
two C-ranks and fourteen D-ranks.
It's not a battle record towrite home about.
However...
However...?
It's about before the Academy.
Hmm?
Do you remember the story...
about the one boy brought backfrom the Kikyo Pass battle?
I remember.
As I recall, I heard an enemy boy survivorat the battlefield
was taken back by a Jonin fromthe medical unit.
So he's that boy...?
Don't take arbitrary actions.
Have you forgottenOrochimaru's orders?
I leave it to you guys.
You in particular, Yoroi.
There should be no problemshere with your ability.
This is where you canshow your strength.
Those of you who are irritated thatI'm ahead of you.
So you're Orochimaru's favorite, huh?
Don't get all high and mighty, kid.
I understand, Yoroi sir.
Oh.
Naruto... Sasuke...
I wanted to play with you guysa little more.
But if I do more than this...
The old me might get stirred up.
I am a spy so far as it goes.
I cannot expose myself, here.
Also...if you are going to watch.
My role of information collectinghas served its purpose...
Master Orochimaru.
I'll save the fun, for some other time...
Sasuke...
And Naruto...
You too.
Now then, there are no otherswho will quit?
I must tell the teachers,about Sasuke's bruise!
Huh?!
Be quiet about this bruise.
Why're you acting tough like that?!
I don't want to watch you sufferall the time anymore!
For me you are...!
This has nothing to do with you!
It's none of your business.
I said it once before...
I'm an avenger.
This is not just a mere exam to me.
The Chunin business hasnothing to do with me.
"Am I strong?"All I want is the answer to that.
By fighting with those who are strong!
And...
I'm Gaara of the desert.
Hey, you there...Identify yourself.
I declare.
You are absolutely no match for me.
If I have the opportunity to fight youin the next exam,
we won't run or hide.
And they're... here!
I will not allow even youto take my path away from me!
Sasuke...
You!
What're you doing putting upa front, you idiot?!
Here Sakura is this worried about you--!
Naruto!
I want to fight you, too.
Huh?!
What Orochimaru saidis sitting on my mind.
I will let Sasuke do the test...
- and see how things go.- Wha--?!
L-Lord Hokage...!
However, if the Curse Mark opens
and the power gets even a little bitout of control,
get in there and stop it.
All right.
But...!
I understand.
Now then, we will begin the preliminaries.
The preliminaries to comewill be one-on-one individual battles.
In other words,actual battle format.
There are now exactly twenty people,so we will conduct ten battles.
The winners will be able toadvance to the third exam.
There are no rules at all.
You will fight until someone dies,collapses...or admits defeat.
And... please admit defeat right awayif you don't want to die.
However, in case I judgethat a match is over...
err... I don't want to needlessly increasedead bodies,
so I will intervene and stop the matchor something to that effect.
What holds the key to your destinies is...
Open it.
This.
The names of two foes will berandomly selected and
displayed on this electronic signboard.
Now then, let's get right down to it
and announce the two namesfor the first battle.
Yoroi Akado vs. Sasuke Uchiha
To think it'd be so soon...?!
I couldn't ask for more.
No way...!
Why Sasuke?!
Now then, the two displayed onthe signboard, come forward.
For the 1st battle, Yoroi Akado andSasuke Uchiha have been selected.
No objections, right?
- Right.- No!
All I can do now is watch...
Sasuke...
Sasuke!
If you want to fight me, don't lose!
Sasuke... You're acting strange...
Is it because of the Curse Mark...?
Sasuke, do your best!
I guess I'll wait and see...
The pain won't go away!
It appears the Curse Mark hurts.
Now then, we will begin the first battle.
Everyone other than the two foes,please move to the upper area.
Hey! Kakashi Sensei!
Sasuke!
Huh?
Don't use the Sharingan.
So you knew?
If that Curse Mark on your neckgets out of control,
it could endanger your life.
I believe it.
Well, the match will becalled off at that time.
I'll be coming in to stop it,so good luck.
Called off, you say?!
It seems this Curse Mark thingis responding to my Chakra.
This is my final Chakra...
Sharingan!
Sasuke, stop using the Sharingan!
If I carelessly build up Chakra,
it would extract my spirit energy,
and bring out the Chakrainside my body to no end.
In other words, in this match,
I can hardly use even my regular Jutsu,not to mention the Sharingan!
However... Yoroi's ability isthe worst for you, Sasuke.
Now then... How will I go...?
Don't act rashly...Sasuke.
Now then, please begin.
Let's go!
Yeah!
Oh no!
He did it!
My strength...?!
W-What is this?
My body strength has suddenly...!
Sasuke!
Sasuke...!
You... my Chakra...
You just noticed now...?
Hey, can you hear it?
The clear, blue sky goes on and on
The ocean spans limitlessly
Please keep that smile on your face forever
Or else I'll cry
You won't have to search around you
It's all ok now.
Everyone is insidethis hand
when you want to cry, and you want to run away
When you forget what happiness is
Just sing.
Light is born, and darkness was born
The two are one
Harmonia, feel the telepathy
Hey, can you hear it?
Dang it!The pain won't go away!
This darned Curse Mark isresponding all the time!
But I won't let thisexam get called off!
How will I do?How should I fight?
Am I strong?
All I want is the answer to that.
I won't let this thing swallow me upin a place like this!
Next episode: "Bushy-Brow's Jealousy--Lions Barrage Unleashed!"Press down hard on the gas
That's right, there's no compromise
We'll slip through the night
At the final moment push hard
That's right, all the way to zero,
Until we wipe away the days
Gently open your heart
If you pull it close to you
It will reach you, without a doubt
It will come, closer
Now
We're speeding through life,squeezing it for all of its worth
Our feet are tied
But we still keep going farther
Even if I take it back, and grasp it
If you're not the one
There will be no meaning
And so we'll go far off into the distance.

... bring it to an end swiftly!
I won't let you do anything.
First move, a surefire victory!
Wow! That's amazing!
What's with his body?!
I dislocate every joint
and with Chakra, I can controlmy softened body at will.
With Chakra...?
I can also squeeze untilyour bones break.
I'll rapidly tighten as longas you don't give up.
I don't know what kind ofninja tool you'll use...
but if I keep doing this to your body,it will make no difference.
I can break your neck right now.
So hurry up and give up.
No.
Do you want to die?!
Idiot. You're the one who'sgoing to die.
His neck is broken.
What?
How ridiculous...
Phew...
Idiot.
I went a little overboard andended up killing you.
W-What?
Okay, now it's my turn.
T-This is a Puppet!
T-That's the real body?
He's... a Puppet Master...
He's controlling the puppet withChakra from his hand!
G-Give up...!
If your bones get crushed,you'll be able to bend even more, huh?
For once, I was close to stoppingthe match in the middle.
The winner, by an inabilityto continue the match by the opponent,
is Kankuro.
Two against one is hittingbelow the belt!
Is that fair, Kakashi Sensei?!
It's not particularly hittingbelow the belt.
It's a puppet, after all.
That's the Puppet Master Jutsu.
He's controlling the puppet with Chakra.
It's the same as usinga ninja tool--like shuriken.
They're all great Chakra users...
I thought I could make itkind of far with Chakra.
Kunoichi Rumble:The Rivals Get Serious!
Ino...!
You've got the jitters,don't you, Sakura?
Wha...?!
Even Sasuke collapsed.
I mean, it felt like it was becauseit was Sasuke that it ended at that.
What'll happen if you take part?
It might be best if you quit!
Something like thatwon't work on me!
It's okay! I can tough it outthis time around, too.
Quit? Who?
I can hardly wait.
Cha! Bring it on!
Now then, to continue,we will begin the fourth battle.
Man, man, nothing butweirdoes all over the place!
Don't you say that!
You've got a point.
You, too, Sakura?!
This isn't the time to be laughing.
Sakura Haruno vs. Ino Yamanaka
I never thought...I'd be fighting you, Sakura.
And what's more, so soon.
Ino was a standoutamong the rookie Kunoichi.
With Sakura as her opponent,
will she go...no,can she go with serious intent?
To think it would be thosetwo of all people.
Things have gotten gloomy.
I wonder if Ino'll be okay.
That's for sure.
What're you going to do, Ino?
Sakura! Good luck! Don't lose!
Begin!
Oh, no. I knew it.
Sakura's totally blowing Ino away!
Idiot.
Say what?!
If you're not an idiot,you must be sleeping, aren't you?
Who...?!
Sure enough, they are Kunoichi.
So this is their level ofhand-to-hand combat?
What?!
It's not because they're Kunoichi.
Huh?
It's just that those two are lukewarm.There's no man or woman in battle.
Lukewarm...?
There!
Kunoichi must learnnot only Ninjutsu...
but also a wide range ofknowledge and refinement as women.
If you don't blend into enemy territoryand conduct yourselves as a normal woman...
you'll have it rough on occasionssuch as when you work as spies.
Today's class is flower arranging.
Now then, everyone.
Let's gather flowers we like.
Yes, ma'am!
Ino, wait up!
You're such a klutz.
I'm...not good at stuff like this.
What about you, Ino?
That's no good, consideringyour name's Sakura.
Listen. There are tricksto things like this.
You know, as for flower arranging,
after you've decided on a main flower,you add other flowers to decorate.
All flowers can't beasserting themselves.
For example... Iook.
You can see those cosmosflowers over there, right...?
For example, if they werethe main flowers...
the thoroughwort flowersyou picked are throw-ins!
As contrasted withspring cherry blossoms,
cosmos flowers have thename of autumn cherry blossom
and are the prettiest flowers of the fall.
Also, they're flowers withthe original meaning of "harmony,"
so any autumn grass wouldgo perfectly with them.
So? Do I look as niceas the cosmos flowers?
Say, say, am I cute?
Uh...yeah.
Say. What's with the pause?
You look like you're havingso much fun.
Billboard Brow!
You've recently reachedadolescence, haven't you?
Don't get too full of yourself!
Ami!
Sorry! You have sucha beautiful cylinder-shaped body
I mistook you for a vaseand put flowers in you.
Ino!
Shinobi flower aconite.
It has weak toxicity, but is poisonous,so you'd best spit them out.
Sensei!
Only the root is poisonous, though.
Ino is great.
She knows everything,is stylish, and is cute.
Even that shuriken skill.
Her Ninjutsu is great, too...
Compared to that, l...
Sakura?
If you're a cosmos flower...
then am I a thoroughwort?
What're you saying?!
What?
Let me see...
In a manner of speaking,you are not a flower, but still a bud!
You're right.
At this point in time...
I don't even plan to fightover Sasuke with you.
What did you say?
You and Sasuke don't go together,and I'm totally stronger than you!
You are beneath my notice!
Sakura! Do you know whoyou're lipping off to?!
Don't press your luck, crybaby Sakura!
I feel like...
I feel like Sakurawas out of line!
Ino's eyes show incredible anger.She's scary.
Hmm. That's not it...
Huh?
Sakura's not the kind ofkid to do things
like needlessly flaunt herown power and hurt people.
She doesn't like having Inotaking pity on her and pulling punches.
I'm a bud, huh...?
Say, Ino...
What?
Why... did you give this ribbon to me?
Actually...
I thought it'd be a waste foryou to wilt away as a bud.
There's no point if flowers don't bloom.
For all we know...
it just might...
become a flowermore beautiful than a cosmos.
Thank you...
Ino!
Okay Sakura.Let's hurry and go pick flowers.
O-Okay.
What's wrong, Sakura?
I got some dirt inmy eye when I fell...
You're so clumsy.
Ino...
All along, I believed in thewords you gave me then.
I really thought that it wouldbe nice if it were so.
It would be nice if I could geta beautiful flower to bloom...
I set my sights on you becauseI wanted to be like you all along.
Thanks to that, I'm here now.
So, Ino, I want to fight you seriously.
If I can't surpass you at yourmost serious, there's no point.
W-What's with Sakura?
Hmm.
Why are those two getting that heated?!
Alas, he doesn't even understandthe reason why he lashes out at Sasuke.
Well, a rival is a mysterious thing,is the point.
Huh?
Oh, hi...
My rival from youth, Kakashi...
Oh, how hip and galling thatnonsensical reaction is.
I...
got on the same team as Sasuke.
Why are you telling me now...?
I won't lose to you anymore, Ino.
No matter what happens,I won't lose to you either, Sakura!
The ribbon...
I'm giving back the ribbon.
I gave you that ribbon.
Besides, a headband is somethingyou put on your head, right?
From here on, I'm no longera girl who will run after you, Ino.
When I put this on my head,
it will be as a female Shinobiwho can't lose to you.
That's a good idea...
Me, too...
until that time.
I understand... Sakura.
- This time for sure...- This time for sure...
- with full strength...- with full strength...
- a fair.. fight!- a fair.. fight!
Hey, can you hear it?
The clear, blue sky goes on and on
The ocean spans limitlessly
Please keep that smile on your face forever
Or else I'll cry
You won't have to search around you
It's all ok now.
Everyone is insidethis hand
when you want to cry,and you want to run away
When you forget what happiness is
Just sing.
Light is born, and darkness was born
The two are one
Harmonia, feel the telepathy
Hey, can you hear it?
Since when did she get this strong?!
Sure enough, Ino's great.
But I won't lose.I absolutely will not lose.
It can't be. She's evenlymatched with me now?!
I'm not who I used to be.
- The next hit is the decisive blow!- The next hit is the decisive blow!
Next episode:"The Ultimate Battle: Cha!"

and someday, I'll live on my own.
Yes, precious things are never in shape
You never know what it is when you get it or lose it

You shouldn't lower your guard, Sensei.
I'll bury you and correctold mistakes, now!
Whatever you do now, it's too late...I've won...
The Leaf Village will crumble!
I am the man who carried on the Leaf Willof the First and Second Hokages...
The Third Hokage!
Orochimaru! Now I will perform anace Jutsu that even you don't know!
Behold! Sealing Jutsu!
Forbidden Secret Technique:Reaper Death Seal!
A Jutsu I don't know...
Must hurry...This darkness is dangerous.
I'll have you show it to me.
What's the matter?
Are you planning to be killedslowly by your predecessors?
Please perform that Jutsu, quick.
Not yet...?
It looks like... I was just in time.
What's the matter?You're already stumbling...
Now all that's left...is to catch them!
I got you!
I won't let go!
Appear!
The darkness has disappeared...What's this Jutsu?
Sarutobi!
I'm sorry... Sarutobi...
We caused you trouble...
Please forgive me...
Lord First Hokage!
Lord Second Hokage!
Seal!
Your own subordinates...!
All members inthe Leaf Village are a part of me.
The villagers believe in me,and I believe in everyone.
That's what the Hokage is.
Saru... Protect those who lovethe village and believe in you.
And bring them up as individualsto whom you can leave the next era.
As of tomorrow, you are the...
Hokage!
Toying with even the livesof your own subordinates...!
Subordinates' lives?Stop the endless nonsense!
Didn't these kids believed in you?
Come! Enma!
You're mine!
Striking Shadow Snake!
Dang it! You little--!
It's over!
What is this sensation...?
This is bad...
- Die!- Die!
We have to hold them off here somehow.
Isn't our back-up here yet?!
This is out of our hands!
Ninja Art: Summoning!Bring Down the House Jutsu!
This Jutsu...
Long time no see, Ibiki.
Jeez, is that bodythe only thing that grew?!
I can't stand to look!
Master Jiraiya...
Jiraiya...! One of Sannin,the three legendary Shinobi?!
Peeps, open up those little eyesof yours just this once and observe well.
How wonderful!
The devil region beyond heavenof Jiraiya, the fantastic sage Ninja...
will rage!
Snakes that have been antagonizedby the frog. Begone!
So that Orochimaru has finally started, eh?
Where's the Third Hokage?
The Exam arena.
I see...
Don't die...old man.
Why... didn't you dodge?
Dang it!
The Reaper Death Seal...
In this Sealing Jutsu,
in exchange for the effectivenessof Jutsu...
one's own soul is handed overto the Grim Reaper.
It's a Jutsu that costs your life...
My Jutsu doesn't activate...
There's no need to dodge.I will die, anyway.
At the same time the Sealing ends,my soul will also be devoured.
It's a Jutsu of the herowho once saved this village.
From now, you will also die...by this Jutsu!
So this Jutsu also sealedthat Nine-Tailed Fox, huh?!
And now, your soul will be dragged out...and sealed!
My body...won't listen to what I say!
You'll probably be able to see it soon.
Your soul is also alreadyabout halfway out, so.
Those who have their souls sealedby this Jutsu
will suffer inside the bellyof the Grim Reaper for eternity
and will never attain peace...
Those who seal and are sealedhave their souls intertwined,
and will hate each other,and continue to battle for eternity!
What...?!
This is... the Grim Reaper?!
Knock it off! You old dotard!I won't let you do as you like.
Hurry up and... die!
Okay, everyone. Line up!
Quiet, everyone!
Konohamaru!
Konohamaru, it's not goingto collapse, is it?
It'll... it'll be okay.
The structure of this face rock path is old,but is of strong construction.
My grandpa said so before.
So it'll definitely be okay.
Someone's coming!
Which one...?
Uchiha, huh?
Then, what about Temari?
Don't run away like that...
Fine.
I'll be your opponent this time.
Wait!
Temari!
I assumed you'd beencreamed by him.
So you're okay?!
Yeah. Somehow...
But...
it didn't turn out tobe much of a delay.
No, it's time necessary forGaara's recovery.
Besides, it'll lead tohis consumption of Chakra.
This is...
Shampoo, again?
No, it's Sasuke.
There are several smells near him.He caught up...
At last...
Sasuke.
He's totally stopped moving.
Is he going to fight with them?!
Sasuke...
Let's hurry!
What's this clump of countless smellscoming from another direction?
Hey! There's something besides ustracking Sasuke!
What?!
An enemy? An ally?!
I don't know. But...
But?
It's not human.
Huh?!
Huh?!
Go! Kankuro! I'll take him again...
Temari, you take Gaaraand go on ahead.
What?
You're at your limit...
I don't need a hindrance.
But...!
Go!
Hurry up and go!
Okay...
It can't be helped...I'll be your opponent!
Humph! I don't care who it is!
No!
Your opponent is me!
You...!
Shino?
Why are you here?!
I put a female beetle on youbefore you left the arena.
The females have almost no smell...
Only a male can sniff outthe subtle smell of the female.
Though the male itselfhas a strong smell...
Sasuke Uchiha...You pursue Gaara.
Because the battle between youand him hasn't been settled yet.
I'll fight him, because originallyI was his opponent...
I withdraw!Please go ahead with the match.
Leave this to me here! Go!
You're very confident.But are you going to be okay?
No need to worry.
I'll go back you up ifI have just ten minutes.
Humph. By then, I'll be done too.
None of you know anything at all.
You guys probably don't knowof the real terror of this world.
In that case...you'll teach me that terror?
No...
If you defeat me and chase Gaara,you'll be forced to know.
That is, only if you can defeat me.
Everyone makes mistakesIt's nothing to be ashamed about
Don't let this scar be for naughtWalk with a smile
Yes, breathe in the airLift your face to the sky and jump
If it rains, take a breakGo where the wind takes you
So many regretsDon't let this scar be for naught
Let's go carve the badges in our chestYes, it's Show Time, life begins now.
Everyone makes mistakesIt's nothing to be ashamed about
Don't let this scar be for naughtWalk with a smile
Transform sadness into the windand continue to forge on
Forge on strong
You who are strong...You who are called Uchiha...
You who have friends...You who have a purpose...
You who are like me...
By killing you, I can truly exist!
Uchiha, you are my prey!
Next time: "Astonishing Truth!Gaara's Identity Emerges!"Press down hard on the gas
That's right, there's no compromise
We'll slip through the night
At the final moment push hard
That's right, all the way to zero,
Until we wipe away the days
Gently open your heart
If you pull it close to you
It will reach you, without a doubt
It will come, closer
Now
We're speeding through life,squeezing it for all of its worth
Our feet are tied
But we still keep going farther
Even if I take it back, and grasp it
If you're not the one
There will be no meaning
And so we'll go far off into the distance.

And the next match.
This year's rookie looks challenging...
Naruto Uzumaki vs. Kiba Inuzuka
It's here, it's here, it's here!
What we've been waiting for!
It's finally my turn!
Yeah! Lucky us!
If it's this guy,we'll absolutely win, Akamaru!
Show us how much you've grown.
I'm going to do it!
Akamaru Unleashed!Who's Top Dog Now?
The seventh battle,aruto Uzumaki versus Kiba Inuzuka.
I got sick of waiting!
It's finally time for me to shine!Believe it!
That's my line!
With you as my opponent,I've as good as won!
Right, Akamaru?
Don't get excited!
You won't be able to beat me!
Why you little...!
Hey! Don't bring your puppy!
He'll get in the way of the match!
You fool!
Akamaru's going to fight with me.
Hey, hey! Is that okay?
Yes.
Animals and insects are treatedthe same as ninja tools.
There's no problem.
Well, that's fine!
It's a perfect handicap!
Talking tough!
Then...
Akamaru, don't put a paw in this.
I'll fight him by myself!
Naruto! Don't lose to a guy like this!
It's finally come.
Naruto, huh?
I'm sorry, but he can't beat Kiba...
Kakashi.
Naruto...
I-I want to support you, but...
Kiba's on my team...
Kiba will get mad...
But...
Naruto...
Kiba's lucky.
Hah!
Hah! I don't know how strong he's becomesince this guy became a Genin...
Today we'll run through Transformation Jutsu.
You'll change yourself into Lord Hokage...
His ability was "that, " so...
Transform!
So noisy...
I was sleeping comfortably...
T-That was a joke!I-I did it on purpose!
Enough, Naruto!
It's your third yearat the academy!
Wha--?
Goodness sake, who is that guy?
We've just switched to this classand already found someone funny.
That guy, he's on a roll.
He's an attention-seeker, huh?
One more time, fool!
Transform!
You...
Is it possible...?
Hey hey, are you serious?
You've been here for three years andcan't even do a respectable transformation?
All of you watch now!
I will absolutely someday becomethe true and a real Hokage!
Lame!
What Hokage?!
Some sympathy at the very least...
I'll do you in, in one clean blow!
Really? But you can't beat me!
I said not to act tough.
Well then. Please begin!
Ninja Art of Beast Mimicry:All-Four Jutsu!
Here I come!
Fast!
It will be a while 'tilhe opens his eyes, Mr. Proctor.
Just as I thought.
That Naruto can't be equal to Kiba.
Naruto...
That was too embarrassing to watch.
See...
What was that?That guy is weak.
Naruto!
Huh?
Yes, that's it...
I'll surpass Hokage!
Then everyone in the village willacknowledge my existence!
Those are his words...
I've always made fun of them, too.
This is the Jonin...a true Ninja...
I have to escape...
If I stay like this...
I'll really, really be killed!
Are you hurt...
Scaredy cat?
You just need to becomestronger than me!
Darn you!
You!
What are you doing all of a sudden?!
T-This stupid coward is...absolutely...not the Sasuke I know!
Don't mess with me!
W-What?
But, it was wrong!
Hey...
are you hurt?
Scaredy cat?
I won't change my words,that's my way of Ninja!
Naruto...
Say it to everyone!
Don't...
Don't...
underestimate me!
Yeah!
He seems to have grownto say such thing.
Naruto...!
Go, Naruto!
What are you talking about,bleeding like that?
Your tough talk has gone too far!
I didn't use my power fully...to observe your strength first!
You too, cut out the tough talkand use the dog or whatever you want!
You'll regret this...
Let's go Akamaru!
Smoke Ball?
Take this!
I can't see!
This is bad!
I have to get out of the smoke...or I'll be done for.
It worked!
What is it...?
Shoot... I can't see anything.
Yeah! We did it!
Yay! Good job, Akama--!
A-Akamaru...
Why?
Why?
You took the bait!
Y-You!
Transform Jutsu?!
Ouch! Shoot!
Let go!
You smell like a dog!
W-Where's Akamaru?!
Over here!
Akamaru! Darn!
No way!
That's Naruto?!
An equal match with Kiba...
No, it may be more than equal!
Applying Shadow Clone Jutsuto Transform Jutsu, that's a clever trick.
Naruto shouldn't be able to do that...
His timing at using Jutsu's is very good.
What? He's better than I thought.
But, to get mad like that afterbiting the opponent himself...
What a funny guy.
N-Naruto... amazing!
That's amazing, Naruto!
You got a little bit stronger.
But it's over.
Next, I'll attack you seriously.
Oh really?!
But you will absolutely not beat me!
During this exam,he's matured again.
This is a surprise...
That's Naruto, the perpetual goof...?
Evidently it's no longer "that" Naruto.
Yeah.
I wonder, what kindof trick Kakashi used...?
Still...
Huh?
As for the development ofmy Kiba and Akamaru,
it's probably more than Naruto.
Naruto...I'll take Akamaru...back!
W-What's this?!
What did you feed him?His fur turned red!
That's why he's called "Akamaru", red boy.
Food Pills huh...?
That Kiba...
He intends to end it with this.
Here we go, Akamaru!
Ninja Art of Beast Mimicry...!
Man Beast Clones!
T-There's something wrongwith their eyes!
He's using some weird drug!
Isn't this doping?
Is this okay?!
Yes. Food Pills are one of Ninja Tools.
You, that's all you say!
What?!
What did that guy eat?
It's Food Pills.
F-Food Pills?
Food Pills are a secret medicinethat people in the military take
and fight for three days andthree nights without a break...
They're high in protein,easily absorbed and
have some types of componentthat influence agitation or sedation...
Kiba and Akamaru's Chakra mustbe doubled right now...
It's over with this...
Let's go!
All-Four...
Jutsu!
N-Naruto!
That Naruto is in danger!
Kiba's the gung-ho fighter typewho will attack
like a beast with Chakra wiredthroughout his body.
And the Food Pills that double one'sChakra are quite simply...
the perfect pill for Kiba.
Naruto...
This isn't good...
There's no way to counterattack...
All I can do is gather allthe Chakra in my legs
and do my best to escape...!
At this rate...
Here's my chance!
Take this!
Man Beast Taijutsu Ultimate Technique!
Fang Over Fang!
This is the difference inour true powers.
I'm going...
to become the Hokage.
I can't lose here...!
You? Hokage?!
When you're weaker than me?
I'll become Hokage for you!
You know deep down insidethat you can't become the Hokage.
So quit acting tough!
You're wrong, Kiba...
Naruto...
He's not that weak...
I'll receive the name...of Lord Hokage!
All of you, just watch!
Naruto, unlike me...
he has always believed in his own worth.
I thought it was really amazing...
It must have been really hard...
I understand that.
And yet before not even one person...
tried to see Naruto.
Hey, that's the kid...
I heard he's the only one...who failed.
Humph! Serves him right!
It's trouble if a kid like thatbecomes a Ninja.
After all, that kid is really...
Stop! Anything further is taboo.
Nobody tried to acknowledgereal Naruto.
Clone Jutsu!
But now...
Everyone's watching...
Stand up! Naruto!
Everyone is acknowledging him!
If you compete with me forthe name of Hokage...
You...will be the loser!
Hey, can you hear it?
The clear, blue sky goes on and on
The ocean spans limitlessly
Please keep that smile on your face forever
Or else I'll cry
You won't have to search around you
It's all ok now.
Everyone is insidethis hand
when you want to cry,and you want to run away
When you forget what happiness is
Just sing.
Light is born, and darkness was born
The two are one
Harmonia, feel the telepathy
Hey, can you hear it?
That Kiba, he sure is stupid.
Think hard about your Jutsuwhen you use them.
Otherwise, your opponentswill take advantage of the Jutsu.
Well, the outcome of you and mecould be seen from the beginning.
The way you've torn me apartup until now,
I'll give it back all at once!
Next episode: "Surprise Attack!aruto's Secret Weapon!"
This is the trick I've been saving up!Press down hard on the gas
That's right, there's no compromise
We'll slip through the night

If "Heaven" does not exist,
enrich your knowledge,and prepare for the chance.
If "Earth" does not exist,
run the fields in searchof an advantage.
Open the series of Heaven and Earth,and the perilous way shall be redressed...
This is namely the secret of"the one that guides... "
What's that?
It probably has to do with the scroll.
I think this means we're supposedto open the Heaven & Earth scroll.
Okay then, I'm going to open it.
Huh? What's this?
A man...?
A person...?
This is...a Summoning Jutsu!
Naruto! Sakura!Let go of the scroll!
Oh...
Wha--?!
Y-You...
Hi!
It's been a long time.
Surviving the Cut!The Rookie Nine Together Again!
W-What's going on?
It appears you guys have hada rough time of it.
What?!
Why are you appearing witha Summoning?
At the end of this second exam,
we Chunin are towelcome the test-takers.
I just happened to be given
the important task of beingthe messenger for you guys.
Messenger...?!
Just in time.
Everyone...
Congratulations on survivingthe second exam.
To celebrate your passing,
I'd like to treat you tosome Ichiraku ramen, but...
Ohh... Cool!
Uh-oh...
H-Hey, Naruto!
- Listen to the end...- Cool! Cool!
Ramen! Ramen!Believe it!
I've done great job!I'm the greatest!
I so want to eat ramen!Believe it!
He's got so much energy.
Yaaaay!
Shut up!
Man, that scatterbrained partof you is the same as always, eh.
I see.
Huh?
If we had looked at the scrollin the middle of the exam,
what were you going to do, Iruka Sensei?
Sasuke, you're a sharp one,as usual.
You guessed right.
The rules of this exam were to testyour conclusive mission execution ability.
To put it simply,
in the case of the scrolls being openedcontrary to the rules...
In the case of them being opened...?
I was ordered to knock unconsciousthe test-takers in front of me
until the end of the exam.
Good thing you didn't open the scroll.
Kabuto, thank you!
Phew!
That was seriously close...
Oh yeah, Sensei!
Huh?
By the way,what're the letters on that wall?
They're kind of vermiculated and
we don't understandtheir meaning at all.
Never mind, never mind!
We passed!
No...explaining that isone more of my duties.
What, really?
I'm saying that's right.
Give it a read.
These are Chunin instructionsMaster Hokage recorded.
Instructions?!
That's right!
Heaven in this textrefers to the human head.
Earth refers to the human body.
No kidding...
If "Heaven" does not exist,
enrich your knowledge,and prepare for the chance.
In other words...
If your weaknesses areinside your head, Naruto...
learn various logics inpreparing for your missions.
Hah! So meddlesome!
If "Earth" does not exist,
run through the fieldsin search of an advantage.
If your weaknesses are inyour physical strength, Sakura,
it means you must notslack off on your daily training.
And if you combine bothHeaven and Earth...
Any perilous mission is the right way...
In other words...
what can also be called a ruleof might and become a safe mission.
Then, what aboutthe spot with the missing letter?
The letter refers to Chunin.
The one letter for "person" thatwas in the scroll from earlier goes there.
These five days of survivalwere to test
the test-takers' fundamentalabilities as Chunin.
And you guys cleared it in fine style.
Chunin is of unit-leader class.
They have the responsibilityof leading a team.
Be more deeply aware ofthe necessity of physical strength...
and knowledge in missions!
I want you to take onthe next step,
never forgetting theseChunin instructions.
That is all of the messenger taskI was given.
Got it!
Huh?
But, as for the final third exam,don't push it too far.
Especially you, Naruto.
- You're the biggest worry...- Iruka Sensei.
From when I received theLeaf headband,
I was no longeran Academy student, you know?!
There's nothing to worry!Believe it!
Also, this is the proof yougave me that I'm full-fledged, right?!
That I 'm scatterbrained maynot have changed,
but I'm not a kid anymore!
I'm now...
A Ninja!
I see.
I'm sorry, Naruto.
I know their strength the best.
If it's futile anyway,
I would like to give themthe final word personally.
If you're that hung up on it,I can leave that team to you.
To think you'd play the devil's advocate...
Thank you very much.
But, they're Kakashi's, right?
If he's the one whorecommended them,
I thought I could count on them.
Stay out of it!
They're not your students anymore.They're my subordinates now.
The one who might truly understand
the strength of these kids.might be you, Kakashi.
How is it?
Does the Curse Mark still hurt?
No.
Thanks to you,it's gotten quite a bit better.
Anyway, Orochimaru is oneof those three legendary Leaf Ninjas, right?
He's a S-rank bingo bookrouge Shinobi
who even the Anbu couldn't touch, right?
I heard that he'd already died, but...
Why'd he come to this village now...?
There's a kid I want, you see.
This kid inherits the abilitiesof the Uchiha clan, so...
It's...
It's probably Sasuke, right?
Huh?!
Master Anko!
Twenty-one second examfinishers have been confirmed.
As for the third exam, accordingto the regulations of the Chunin Exams,
preliminaries are planned forthe first time in five years.
The second exam is over.
For the time being,continue the exams as is,
but while keepingan eye on his movements.
Yes...
First off, congratulations onfinishing the second exam.
There were seventy-eighttest-takers for the second exam.
To think twenty-one havemade it this far.
I said to make it less than half,but I'd really thought about single digits.
I'm hungry!
There are still this many remaining?
This is such a major pain.
Sasuke and others have passed, too.
Of course...
We went to that much troubleto save them...
It'd all be for naught if they didn't pass.
Your team didn't do too bad.
I guess they were lucky.
But as long as my team is around,they can't go any higher.
After all, whether youlike it or not,
ability talks at the next barrier.
Well, adolescence can sometimesbe bittersweet and
can sometimes be harsh, Kakashi...
Did you say something?
Oh my God!
Not bad, my rival Kakashi.
But that part of you is so hip...which is what annoys me!
So that's Guy Sensei's eternal rival, eh?
Guy Sensei totally loses visually...
Guy Sensei is the hippestof all the teachers!
He shines!
Okay!
Please watch, Guy Sensei!I'll shine, too!
I don't ever want to seetears of those dear to me again.
So...
I won't ever lose again!
Guy Sensei.
Sure enough, the outstanding candidateshave gathered.
Sasuke Uchiha, eh?
I'll get you back for my arms,Sasuke Uchiha...
At any cost.
To think a mere seven teamsare left of the twenty-six...
Sure enough, Gaara is unhurt.
Akamaru's acting strange...
Those Sand Village guys...
Naruto passed, too.
Thank goodness...
What, all the Leaf Villagerookies are here.
Say! Say!
Old man Hokage and Iruka Sensei andeven Intense-Brow are here. Believe it!
It feels like everyone's assembled.
Humph... I don't have a very good feeling.
To think this many are left...
Moreover, of those left, almost all are rookies...
So that's why they foughtin recommending them.
Now then, we will now havethe explanation of the third exam
from Master Hokage.
Listen carefully, everybody!
Now then, if you will,Master Hokage.
All right.
Before the explanation ofthe third exam that we will start from now,
I have just one thing I wantto tell everyone flat out.
About the true purpose of these exams.
True purpose...?!
Why do allied nations conductthe exams on a conjoint basis?
Huh?
Raising the levels of the shinobiand friendship among allied nations.
It won't do to have the wrong ideaof the true meaning of that statement.
These exams are so to speak...
So to speak...?
A microcosm of battlebetween allied nations.
What does that mean?
If we look back on history,
the allied nations of today wereonce neighboring nations
that continued to vie witheach other and battle for power.
In order to avoid a futile crushingof each others' military strength,
those nations mutually selecteda place to battle.
And that was how theChunin Exams originally began.
W-Why do we haveto do such a thing?
We're not doing this toselect Chunins?!
There is no question that these examsare to select Shinobi
worthy of becoming Chunin.
But on the other hand,
these exams also provide a venue
for Shinobi who carry their nation's prideon their backs to fight for their lives!
Nation's pride...?
Many feudal lords and those ofprominence from many nations
who request Shinobi for workare invited to this third exam as guests.
And, the feudal lords andHead Ninja of each Village
of the nations will watch your battles.
If the gap in national powerbecomes unbridgeable,
the strong nations are inundatedwith job requests.
The requests of nations deemedweak, on the other hand, decline.
And therewithal,
we can exert pressure uponeach neighboring nation...
That is to say, just how much militarystrength our Village is developing and has.
Even so, why is it necessary forus to fight for our lives?!
The nation's strength isthe Village's strength.
The Village's strength isthe Shinobi's strength.
And the true strength of the Shinobiis created only in a fight for one's life!
This exam is a place to seethe strength of home country Shinobi,
and a place to display this as well.
It is because it's an exam whereyou truly fight for your life
that this has meaning.
It's for this very reason thatyour forerunners fought in this exam,
a dream worth striving for.
Then why...use the expression "friendship"?!
I said it at the start, didn't l?!
That it won't do for you to havethe wrong idea of the meaning!
It's a custom where balance ispreserved by fighting and removing life.
This is the friendshipof the Shinobi world.
This is a fight for life withthe pride of the village and
one's own dream on the line.
Heh, I'm convinced.
Anything is fine.
Just tell us the content ofthat fight-for-life test.
Very well.
Now then, this is where I'd like toexplain the third exam.
But actually...
Master Hokage, please allow me,Hayate Gekko,
who was given the task of judge,to speak first.
I leave it to you...
Nice to meet you, everyone...
Umm, there's something...I'd like you all to do...
before the third exam.
Hey, can you hear it?
The clear, blue sky goes on and on
The ocean spans limitlessly
Please keep that smile on your face forever
Or else I'll cry
You won't have to search around you
It's all ok now.
Everyone is insidethis hand
when you want to cry, and you want to run away
When you forget what happiness is
Just sing.
Light is born, and darkness was born
The two are one
Harmonia, feel the telepathy
Hey, can you hear it?
What's the idea?Sudden preliminaries?
Didn't we just get to the tower?Also, something's wrong with Sasuke.
It's too much for you, Sasuke!Please, drop out!
You're in no conditionto fight properly!
No matter what you say,
I'm going to tell the teachersabout that bruise.
Next episode: "Narrowing the Field:Sudden Death Elimination!"
Sasuke, I'm scared.Press down hard on the gas
That's right, there's no compromise
We'll slip through the night
At the final moment push hard
That's right, all the way to zero,
Until we wipe away the days
Gently open your heart
If you pull it close to you
It will reach you, without a doubt
It will come, closer
Now
We're speeding through life,squeezing it for all of its worth
Our feet are tied
But we still keep going farther
Even if I take it back, and grasp it
If you're not the one
There will be no meaning
And so we'll go far off into the distance.

I'm going...
to become the Hokage.
I can't lose here!
You? Hokage?!
When you're weaker than me?
I'll become...Hokage for you!
Transform!
Hey hey, are you serious?
You've been here three years
and you can't even doa respectable transformation?!
All of you watch now!
I will absolutely someday becomethe true and a real Hokage!
Lame! What Hokage?!
You know deep down inside thatyou can't become the Hokage.
So quit acting tough!
You're wrong Kiba...
If you compete with me forthe name of Hokage...
You...will be the loser!
Surprise Attack!aruto's Surprise Weapon!
Man! Same thing over and over again.You're pesky!
Well, never mind.
I'll just make it soyou won't stand up again!
Let's go, Akamaru!
You think you can get me withthat same technique again?!
Take this!
Darn!
Fang Over Fang!
This Jutsu...
Though, I've seen it before...
it's not a Jutsu you can dodgeover and over!
What do I do?
What should I do?!
Looks like you've got nothing left.
I've got plenty left!
Even if you increased yourself bythree or four, I'd still have a lot left!
You've got a comebackfor everything!
Let's finish him with the next!Akamaru!
Darn!
I have to counterattack somehow.
Even if I do, it has to get Kibaor there's no point!
But which is which...?
W-What will you do? Naruto!
Naruto...
T-That's it!
Transform!
You're mine!
I see how it is...
Huh?
There, look closely.
Oh!
You did it!
That's a clever move, Naruto!
Naruto!
If he transforms into Kiba,
the real Kiba doesn't know which isAkamaru and which is Naruto...
He can't attack carelessly.
However, it's okay for Narutoto attack either one!
Oooh!
He created a chance opening...
Good work!
I see, so that's your move...
But...
I'll give you a piece of advice!
I was careless before anda little late to realize it...
But the Transformation Jutsuisn't effective anymore!
Why, you ask?
Yeah!
I can smell you.
Don't mess with oursense of smell, Naruto.
By concentrating his Chakrainto his nose,
Kiba's sense of smell is enhanced tensof thousands times more than average.
Of course, he can determinepeople by their smell too.
Heh, I won!
W-What?!
What's going on?!
Kiba's nose got Naruto andAkamaru mixed up?
Darn! What in the world is going on...?!
Then you're Naruto!
Messing with me!
What?!
Well, this is coming fromthe original prankster, after all...
He's had it!
He did it!
Naruto... Awesome!
Darn it!
So that's it...
Naruto, transformed into Kiba,
was discovered by the real Kibawith smell and hit...
But Naruto didn't come backin true Naruto form.
Instead, he transformed intoAkamaru instantly!
In order to make it look as if itwas Akamaru who was hit
and his impersonationtransformation dissolved!
Was Naruto ever that smart...?
You little...!
Think hard about your Jutsubefore you use them!
Because they'll be usedagainst you, stupid!
He's using my line, word to word...
Arguing with this guy is onlya waste of time!
Don't go at Naruto's pace...
Calm down.
Calm down!
He can't actually keep up withmy movements yet...
I still have the advantage!
Look closely at Naruto's movementsand if there's an opening...
I can surely take him frombehind with the All-Four Jutsu.
Nothing to get flustered about...
If I do this in a level-headed manner,it's a match I will most certainly win!
Evidently your enemyhas become calm...
Well, what will you do, Naruto...?
So you've finally gotten serious, Kiba?
Well then... I'll end this...
with my new special techniqueI've been saving up!
So you've finally gotten serious, Kiba?
Well then... I'll end this...
with my new special techniqueI've been saving up!
What?!
New special trick?!
Huh? When did he...?!
Leave it to Naruto to hidea new technique!
What new special technique!
That's obviously a bluff!
You can test out whetherit's a bluff or not!
This hasn't changed since before...
Don't let his pace get to you.
Calm down!
Let's go!
I don't know what kind oftechnique this is but...!
I just won't let you do it!
Now!
Ninja Art of Beast Mimicry...All-Four Jutsu!
Q-Quick...
Why are you stopping?!
Naruto!
Naruto!
Just as I thought, this is asfar as he will go.
Stand up! Naruto!
D-Darn! I don't even have timeto work up my Chakra!
Hey hey! What's wrong?!
Naruto!
He's fast!
It's no good.
He doesn't have time toform hand Signs!
There's too much of a differencein their strength...
It's impossible for Naruto, after all.
Naruto...
D-Darn!
Take this!
What?!
Take that!
I'm going to be Hokage!
I won't lose here!
Whatever! You can't keep upwith my speed at all!
Hey hey hey hey hey hey hey!
Naruto!
This is what it's like whenI really let it out.
You understand, don't you?
To me, you're merely...!
I...
Huh?
will absolutely not lose!
That Naruto... He's a fighter.
Yup.
If I were Kiba,I'd be sick of this already.
It doesn't matter which anymore,I just wish they'd settle it quickly.
Naruto...
Fight!
Naruto! Use the new techniqueor whatever!
Just settle it!
Naruto! Go for it!
I have to find some openingin that darn Kiba...
You've got absolutely no effect on me!
You've got spirit, I'll give you that!
He's close at his end...
I'll settle it with the next one!
I'll make the new techniqueexplode no matter what!
I won't let you!
You're slow!
Take this!
Oops!
Fast movements and a keen nose...
The Ninja Art of Beast Mimicryturned out to be harmful...
Right now Kiba's sense of smellis tens of thousands times
more powerful than normal...
Well...
That fart was probablya freak accident, but...
That's what you'd expect fromthe number one unpredictable Ninja.
Naruto!
Now's your chance!
Darn!I was straining too much...
But now's the time to showmy new technique!
Shadow Clone Jutsu!
Naruto!
Okay! The way you've torn meapart up until now,
I'll give it back all at once!
D-Darn it!
U-!
Zu-! Ma-! Ki-!
Naruto...Barrage!
A new technique, eh?
Well, he was watching Sasuke'stechnique a moment ago...
Lion Barrage!
For the record, the nameis a rip off, too.
The winner is Naruto Uzumaki.
Ohhhh!
Cha!
Nice one!
You did it!
That Naruto beat Kiba!
It's a major upset...
Yup!
Yes!
I'm...getting stronger!
That was easy!
W-What to do?
What should I do...?
N-Naruto...
Huh? Hinata?
Did you say something?
Ah, ah, ah...Umm...
Huh?
Hinata...?
What's this?
It's an ointment.
Why for me?
Take it for her, Naruto.
Hmmm. Okay!
Thank you! You're nice, Hinata!
Kiba, it's nothing to beembarrassed about...
This kid was a reallystrong opponent.
You are taking this pretty easy,aren't you, Lady Hinata...?
Hey, can you hear it?
The clear, blue sky goes on and on
The ocean spans limitlessly
Please keep that smile on your face forever
Or else I'll cry
You won't have to search around you
It's all ok now.
Everyone is insidethis hand
when you want to cry,and you want to run away
When you forget what happiness is
Just sing.
Light is born, and darkness was born
The two are one
Harmonia, feel the telepathy
Hey, can you hear it?
What's with that guy!
Calling people failure and judging them!
Blah blah blah blah blah blah!Talking like a wise guy!
I'm in a bad mood!
Hinata, you say something!
Get that guy!
Show that guy that peoplecan really change!
Next episode:"Byakugan Battle: Hinata Grows Bold!"
Go! Fight! Hinata!Yeah, turn your sadness into kindness, your uniqueness into strength
Even if you get lost, let's start walking
One more time
Are you really happy
when you're always meeting to someone's expectations?
Even if you change to who you really wanna be

Yes, precious things are never in shape
You never know what it is when you get it or lose it

Hit it or Quit it:The Final Rounds Get Complicated!
You...
You did it!
So that fox kid can fight like this...
That was awesome!
Well done!
That was a great fight!
Yay!
And he still has the energyto run around...
Man... He's got crazy stamina that guy...
That Naruto...
He keeps getting stronger...
He did it...that kid.
Yeah! He's on the right track!
And he's a little cute...
Something about it...
I'm envious of you...
Watching your battle makes me thinkthat I have to work really hard too...
That's amazing, you know?
He won. Is it for real?
I thought he was the same as me,in the not going anywhere class...
Not going anywhere?
Now people are squealing...
Looks like he's part of the groupthat's going somewhere.
Maybe I couldn't beat him...
This is really bad.It kinda depresses me...
To retain himself and draw outthe Chakras of the Nine-Tailed Fox...
Yeah... Most of the Leaf Village peoplehere are surprised.
That Naruto...
When did he learn to control the strengthof Nine-Tailed Fox to that extent?
Even a bird who gets caught,once it learns how,
will open the lid of its basketwith its own beak.
He won't give up, for he wants tofly freely in the sky again.
This time you lost!
Father...
It's okay, there's no damageto his internal organs.
It seems like his Chakrais almost used up.
You are not the only one special.
Why do you act againstyour fate that much?!
Because I was called a failure...
Those who become Hokageare born to that fate.
So what?!
Lord Hyuga!
I'm sorry but...Could you step out for a moment?
B-But...
It won't take long.
Y-Yes.
What do you need from me?
That day...
I came to tell you the truth...about that day.
That day...?
At that time, I intended to die!
W-What are you talking about?!
That day my father...
He was killedas your body double!
The truth of that day... is here.
They're probably only excuses madeat the convenience of the head family.
The person you are now...should be able to understand.
This writing...!
Neji... I only have a little time left.
I want to use that limited timeto convey something to you...
Convey something to me?
The head of Ninjas from theLand of Lightning,
who was trying to kidnap Miss Hinata,was killed by Lord Hiashi...
But the Land of Lightning didn'tacknowledge the abduction of Miss Hinata,
made only the killingof the head Ninja a problem,
and made unreasonable demands.
It can't be helped.
With my one life,the village can be saved...
Wait, Hiashi. Don't be so hasty!
The Hyuga's Kekkei Genkaiis an important strength of this land.
It is the duty of the head familyto protect it forever...
However, for the sake of that duty...
if we involve our landin a desperate war...!
I understand that!That's why...
Isn't that whywe have branch families?
Hizashi's corpse...We'll hand it over as your body double.
Hizashi too...understands the situation.
However, what they want isthe secret of the power of the Byakugan.
The point in time thatHizashi becomes a corpse,
that power will be sealed.
I don't believe that the Land of Lightningwill consent to that.
That's their true intent,
but the condition made by Lightning is to"Hand over Hiashi Hyuga's dead body."
We pretend that we agreedto their terms,
and hand Hizashi,who is identical to you, over...
and they can't pursue itany further than that.
B-But...
Hiashi... The time has come...
Your predecessors have done the sameto protect the power of Hyuga clan.
Even siblings...have the heart to write each other off.
That is the fate of the head family.
And this... is the destiny ofones born into Hyuga!
Where has Lord Hiashi,who is always bullish, go?
The scale of this issue is differentfrom the ones in the past!
It's not that easy...
H-Hizashi...you...
Please... let me go.
You... You... have Neji.
Why do you choose death...for the head family?!
That's not so!
I have been resentingthe head family.
To tell the trutheven now I'm bitter.
That's why...
I want to die protecting you as"my brother," not as the head family.
It's the first time I've hadthe freedom to choose.
I've only shown Neji my ugly side.
However, now I've come hereand finally know my own intentions.
So please tell Neji...
I-I wasn't killed to protectthe head family...
but to protect my siblings,family and the land...
by my own will I chose death!
T-To choose death...you call that freedom...?
Big brother...
Once, just this once,I wanted to defy the fate of Hyuga.
I wanted to choose my own fate.
That's all.
Overcome your own fate, Neji...
Fate is something you work outwith your own hands.
Father...
This is... the truth!
I'm sorry!
Please... raise your head.
Father...
I wonder if a person's destiny isonly floating like a cloud in a fixed current...
Or is a person able to rideon the current that he chooses.
I don't understand it well yet.
Whichever, the end pointmight still be the same...
Just, when the choice is the latter...
people turn toward the goal ofliving and work hard toward it.
And those who hold thatare really strong.
I feel like I finally understand,through this battle...
And... father...
I have only one goal...
I want to become stronger,so I won't lose to anyone.
That's how I feel now.
Father...I see many birds flying.And they seem to be enjoying themselves.
It's buzzing.
That's because it was a good battle...
Certainly, there's that too, but...
It's likely that, for the curious headsof Ninja and the feudal lords,
there is no match they look forward tomore than this next match.
By the way, it seems thathe wasn't seen at the opening ceremony...
He's arrived here already, hasn't he?
There's been no news of Sasuke.
And there's the issue of Orochimaru.
Before everyone starts to make noise,we should disqualify him...
What's going on?!Hurry up and start the next match!
How long are you going tomake us wait!
Before night falls!
I wonder what's going onwith the next match?
Is Sasuke here?
Sasuke...
That guy...What in the world is he doing?!
Is he planningnot to show up?
A wise man never courts danger...
A wise judgment... is it?
What are you saying?
He'll definitely come! Believe it!
But seriously, what is he doing?
Keep this up and he...he'll be disqualified.
There's no choice...
Sasuke is... disqualified.
Y es.
Sasuke Uchiha is... disqualified?
It has to be done.
What in the world arewe going to do?
If that guy doesn't show up,our plan of strategy...
This isn't good...
Could he have...?
Where are you going, Gaara?
I'm going to confirm my existence...
Darn that Gaara...
I wonder if he really killed him...
Sasuke one more time...
What happened?
It's obvious that you're therestanding with the thirst for blood.
Why don't you come out?
It's you...
Lord Hokage...
I want you to consider waiting a little bitfor Sasuke Uchiha's disqualification.
I understand your point, but...
No matter how excellent the Shinobi,
to make light of time is nota qualification for Chunin.
If there's no clear reason to satisfy
the heads of Ninja and feudal lordswho are here,
there's no reason to wait for him!
I see...
Well then, there is a sufficient reason.
Including myself...
most of the heads of Ninja andfeudal lords that are here...
came here becausethey want to see the next match.
However...
He's the remaining survivorof the "Uchiha."
Land of the Wind too, absolutely,is hoping for a bout with our Gaara.
Lord Hokage...
There's no guarantee thatSasuke will come but...
All right then...
We shall specially postponethis match and wait.
Lord Hokage! Really...
Inform so to the Proctor!
Y-Yes.
However...
It's rare for you to insist like that,Lord Kazekage.
Well...
To show off the Shinobi's qualitiesof our village to the feudal lords...
there's no better opponentthan an Uchiha.
It's a chance for us as well.
C'mon, what happened to the match?!
What happened to Uchiha?!
I understand...
Everyone! The candidate for thenext battle has not arrived here!
We'll briefly postpone this battleand start the following battle ahead of it.
What is he doing... that Sasuke?
Great, so Sasuke didn't get disqualified!
That's good...
Hey! That means my matchis one match closer!
Then, on to the next pair!
Kankuro and Shino Aburame!Come down!
My match...doesn't matter at all.
More importantly...
I'd rather not expose the Mechanismof Crow to the enemy before the plan...
Proctor!
I abstain!
What?!
I abstain!Please advance the matches!
Due to Kankuro's abstention,Shino Aburame wins by default!
What's that all about?!
Have a proper match!
You are...?
It's my turn, isn't it?
It seems that you're really fired up.
Okay, let's go to the next match.
Hey! The last one, come down!
Hey! Hey! What are you doing,frivolously building things up?
I mean, why does onlymy match have to be modified?
Shikamaru Nara! You!
Damn...If it's like this I'll abstain too...
C'mon! Shikamaru, fight hard!
Damn that Naruto...
One! First, Tyson jumps and slamdunks
Two! He kisses and hugs everyonerandomly and says "l LOVE YOU"
Three! Masala masters Yogabut hates curry
Four! Sanchez is a lousy bullfighter. Ole!
All over the world, the sky's smiling,so look up and smile too
Oh yeah! Oh yeah! Oh yeah!Fight! Fight! Fight!
One! Bodimahattaya-san devoteshis time for digging black ships
Two! Peking Duck, Action Scene,Chen Lee speeds around on his bike
Three! Popo loves to polish his Coteka
Four! Japanese people,now lend me you hand!
All over the world, the sky's smiling,so look up and smile too
Oh yeah! Oh yeah! Oh yeah!Fight! Fight! Fight!
All over the world, the sky's smiling,so look up and smile too
Oh yeah! Oh yeah! Oh yeah!Fight! Fight! Fight!
Go! Shikamaru!
It looks a bit strange that Shikamaruis fighting in the Final Round.
He's good, firing up, burning up!That's my teammate!
But, doesn't he seem spaced outlooking at the sky?
He totally looks so ambitious.All right, Shikamaru!
Keep it up andattack hard!
Next time, "Zero Motivation:The Guy with Cloud Envy!"
Ino, your cheering is kinda scary.
C'mon!
Running like a fugitive,
Being chased by something
Inside my heart is pounding
My throat dry like it's withering
For no single one,
To none does belong,
This time is ours, right now...
Unraveling the pain,
Unraveling our hearts,
Unraveling shadows
Stifling our breath,
Reaching for beyond,
Tearing through the dark
In fighting and in love
To the distant light above,
Yes, we are on the way
I wanna rock...
Rockin' my heart
Darn it!
Where'd he attack from?!Is it the clones?
Where's the real body?!
It's useless for you to even attemptfollowing with your eyes.
I absolutely will not be caught.
Humph. Shadow Clone Jutsu!
Don't!
This is a teleportation Jutsu that
uses mirrors that canreflect only my image.
Watching you from the speed I move,
it almost seems as ifyou aren't moving at all...
I knew it!
Is that Jutsu...the Kekkei Genkai?!
Kekkei...Genkai...?
It's the same type asmy Sharingan...
Then...!
That's right...
It's impossible even for meto copy that Jutsu...
And there's no way to destroythat Jutsu, either!
Darn it...
So... What?!
I can't die here yet.
'Cause I have a dreamthat I must turn into reality...
The dream to have my strengthrecognized by everyone in the village...
and become the Hokage!
Dream...
I, for the sake of my dream.And you, for the sake of your dream.
Please don't hold it against me.
I want to protect someonespecial to me...
I work for the sake of that person,I fight for that person,
and I want to make thatperson's dream a reality...
That's my dream.
For the sake of that dreamI will completely become a Shinobi,
and kill you guys!
Zero Visibility:The Sharingan Shatters
Sasuke! Naruto!Don't lose to a guy like that!
Stop it, Sakura. Don't goad him!
What?
Even if there was a chance thatwe could break that technique,
they won't be able to defeat that boy.
W-What do you mean?
They don't have the mentalityto kill their feelings...
and kill another person!
That boy really knowsthe agony of being a Shinobi.
He's different from Naruto and Sasuke.
Exactly...
No real Shinobi will come out ofa peace-addicted village like yours.
Because they are not ableto learn
the most important "experience of killing"!
Then...
Then...
What are we going to do, Sensei?!
If I go over toaruto and Sasuke,
Tazuna will be in danger.
Even if I try the Shadow Clones.
He'll come to stop me withhis Water Clones.
I'll just be wasting Chakra.
Then...
I'm sorry but...
I'm going to have to finishthis in an instant.
Sharingan?!
The Sharingan again?
Such an unimaginative guy!
Sensei!
You might call me "an unimaginative guy,"
but you are afraid of the Sharingan,after all... Zabusa!
The secret technique of a Shinobi...
isn't something that you showyour opponent so many times.
Be appreciative.
You're the only who has hadthe chance to see it twice...
And there will be no third time...
Even if you were able to defeat me,you can't defeat Haku...
What...?
Kakashi Sensei can't win?
That boy in the mask is that strong?
Since he was a kid, I have beenpainstakingly teaching him
the battle techniques of the Ninja!
All of my techniques.
On top of that...
he has been polishing uphis own skills as well!
As a result...
He has...
no matter how unbelievably difficulthis predicament,
been extremely successful.
He has no "heart" and hasabandoned the notion of "life."
He is a fighting machineknown as a Shinobi.
Not only that,his Jutsu surpasses mine!
The terrifying ability ofthe Kekkei Genkai.
In other words,I have acquired a sophisticated tool.
Unlike the scrap you'recarrying around.
I'm not one to be afraid justbecause I failed once!
I'll do it as many times as it takes!
The Shadow Clone Jutsu!
Stop!
W-What the hell is it...?!
I-It was just slight but...
I could see the trails of his movements...
One more try!
Shadow Clone Jutsu!
Don't you understand that it's useless?
Just because I see the trail,
doesn't mean that I can keep upwith his speed.
The water...is being repelled.
But, what if that wasn't water...?
All right...
The next one is goingto be my one shot!
Just because a bunch of scrapgot together
doesn't mean thatthey can defeat Haku.
He is....He is the best tool!
There's nothing boring thana stranger bragging...
It's about time...I make my move.
Now wait.As long as we're talking...
Let me brag about another thing...
Hmm?
In the battle before,
I didn't just let you defeat melike a fool.
It's over...
Haku, who was hiding in the corner,
was observing part of the battle.
Haku is quite smart.
With his ability to analyze,
he is able to plan a counterattackafter observing a technique just once.
I've been anxious to copy your line.
"I'll tell you now, but the same Jutsuwon't work on me twice."
Was that it...?
Ninja Art, Hidden Mist Jutsu!
Ninja Art, Hidden Mist Jutsu!
This is...?!
What is this...?This really thick fog?
The visibility is close to zero...
Sensei...!
Sakura! Stay with Tazuna!
That's right.
I have to trust Sasuke,aruto and Kakashi Sensei right now...
And I should do what I can do!
Huh?
Oh! Sakura!
Mr. Tazuna, no matter what,don't move away from me!
Yeah... I soo know it!
I know...Zabusa...
I'll finish them off soon enough...
Shadow Clone Jutsu!
You just don't learn, do you?!
What? The Fire Style Jutsu!
It takes...too long!
This is good!
Bit by bit, I'm figuring outthe timing...
I know it's called Hidden Mist,but the fog is way too thick...
Even Zabusa himself shouldn'tbe able to see anything...
Good job on dodging it...
Just what I expect of Kakashiof the Sharingan...
He's....
closing his eyes!
But... the next time you see me,
that'll be the end of it all...
You overrate the Sharingan too much.
What...?
You spoke as if you saw througheverything, but...
Why?
Could it be possible thatyou can see the future...?!
You are going to die.
Your foresight was wrong, after all.
Kakashi...
You can't read my mind ormy future...
The Sharingan is merely a diversionthat makes you believe that!
Those who have the Sharingan...
possess bothperceptive eyes and hypnotic eyes...
Using these two powers andbringing out Jutsus one after the other..
you were just acting as ifyou can read the future!
First with the perceptive eyes,you copied my movement right away.
And this is the ImageReplication Method.
You first got me ina ruffle with it...
Once you make sure thatI'm flustered,
you nail the "heart's voice."
- This is the Mind Imitation Method.- It's only an imitation, after all.
- You can't defeat me! You monkey!- You can't defeat me! You monkey!
That imitating monkey mouth...
I'll make sure that you won't beable to open it anymore!
And...
You judged the right timing whenmy frustration was reaching its height
W-What is that?
You set a clever trap.
Me...?
You used the Genjutsu withyour hypnotic eye and
made me weave the signs first...
This is the Jutsu Imitation Method...
The Giant Vortex Jutsu!
R-Ridiculous!
Then that makes it easier.
First vanish into the thick fog,
and make yourperceptive eyes useless....
Huh?
Darn! The guard is falling behind!
I will close my eyes as well!
I will shut off your ability to useyour hypnotic eye
in a close-distance battle.
Why?
That also means thatyou will lose your ability to see.
Did you forget...?
That I am a genius in Silent Killing,
a technique to findthe target just by sound.
He read my movement...o way could he do that.
Darn! We were so close!
Naruto, can you still move?
Of course! I'm totally fine!
He's pretty much spent...and it's no wonder.
Shadow Clone Jutsu usesa lot of Chakra.
But thanks to him,I found our way out.
I found the way to break through!
Hah! Impossible!
That was just a coincidence.
Naruto! Run!
What?
Run out of here andattack from the outside!
A-All right!
You won't be able to...!
I-I'm not going to lose!
There!
Fire Style: Fire Ball Jutsu!
Darn!
T-That was good just now!
What?
We're doing it one more time!
All right!
It's likely that there's a limitto that guy's Chakra, too!
To prove that,he's little by little...
This won't go as you've planned.
First, I'll get you!
Sasuke!
Darn! It's been a while sinceI've fought in such bad conditions.
And I'm worried aboutSasuke and Naruto, too...
Be calm... Think...What will he come after?
Oh no!
What?!
Too late!
Why? Why is it?
Why did this happen?
I never asked for your help!I hated you!
But you...
Darn! I won't forgive you!

Naruto's Ninja Handbook
Shadow Clone Jutsu!
Here goes!
From this moment on,Secret Ultimate Taijutsu technique!
Naruto Uzumaki...Clone Body Slam!
- Now!- Now!
Okay!
Shadow Clone Jutsu!
Once again...Shadow Clone Jutsu!
Take this!
Leaf Village Secret UltimateTaijutsu technique
Iearned from Kakashi Sensei!
A Thousand Years of Death!
An enema?
Boom.
Sasuke...?
That was a splendid blow.
D-Did that get him?
Gaara...
Doing all that work...And managing just one blow, huh?
S-Shut up!
He attacked the base of the tailwhich has the weakest defense...
Even though I'm not wounded,I can't absorb the impact.
Did I underestimate him too much?
Hey, Naruto...
Sakura... Go rescue herif it's the last thing you do!
And after you've rescued her...
take Sakura andlose no time in fleeing.
You, if anyone, can do it!
Sasuke... You...
I still have the ability...to hold him in check for a while.
If things end here...
it would just mean thatwas the extent of the man I am.
I lost everything once...
I don't want to see...
any precious comrades dieright before my eyes again.
Precious...comrades...
I will not allow my comrades...
to be killed, no matter what.
I see...
That's right.
Because he resembles me...
Because he has gone through life
with the same lonelinessand sadness as I have...
That guy who continued to fightin solitude for himself,
I thought... he was strong.
Naruto...
But that's not the meaningof true strength...
If one fights just foroneself in solitude...
one can't really become strong...
Is there someone whois precious to you?
When a person wants to protectsomeone who is precious to him...
it's then that they truly...become...strong.
You will...become strong.
He's releasing suchmassive amount of Chakra!
That's...Naruto?!
No matter what, I will...
protect you!
Multi-Shadow Clone Jutsu!
He's pretty good, this one.
I've kept you waitinga long time!
The spiraling series of Naruto Uzumaki'sinja Handbook starts now!
W-What's up with this...Iarge number of clones?!
What the heck is this?
T-This is...amazing!
You are pretty promising.
You... This is...
Sasuke, you get yourselfa good rest.
Leave the rest to Naruto Uzumaki!
This guy is...
All right! Everyone! Here I go!
that Naruto?!
Jump!
Naruto's... Ninja... Handbook!
Everywhere...
Shuriken!
My body hasn't fully recovered...
My only choice is touse Sand as a defense!
- Na! Ru! To! 2K Uzumaki...!- Na! Ru! To! 2K Uzumaki...!
- Barrage!- Barrage!
T-This guy...!
- This time, I'll use both legs...- This time, I'll use both legs...
- and go for a 4K Barrage!- and go for a 4K Barrage!
Who the heck is that...?Suddenly...
Unbelievable...To get Gaara in that state...
Where does that strength come from?
No way!There's no way...
No way I'll... Iose to... a guy like this...!
W-What's... that?
It finally...emerged.
The Perfect Possession!
This is...the monster inside that guy.
I didn't think you wouldexpose this form!
Naruto!
Darn... my body...!
My Chakra has...with all those clones earlier on...
Sakura!
D-Darn...!
I, lnu, Tori, Saru, Hitsuji...
This will mark your end...
- Sand Burial!- Summoning Jutsu!
It's amazing that he can utilizea Summoning Jutsu in that state...
I will protect...
Sakura!
Naruto Uzumaki...
You continue to give mesuch pleasure...
Naruto...What in the...world...?
My hours of practiceare finally paying off!
I can do it!
- What is this?- Huh?
Not you again!What in the world do you want?
Huh?!
That must be...the Shukaku of the Sand.
Chief Toad!Come join me in this fight!
No way!
What?!
Why would I go out of my wayand fight a guy like that?
That's idiotic!
Why?!
You told me the other day that youwould make me your henchman!
It's only natural for a chiefto help out his henchman!
That's respect and duty, right?!
It's true I told youI'd make you my henchman...
But we haven't even exchangedcups of sake to seal our relationship yet...
Gimme a break! I'm still underage!
I can't drink alcohol!
Don't say that and just listento what this guy says, Pop!
Huh?! Pop?!
Why are you here, Gamakichi?
I had lots of time on my hands,so I came to visit...
Huh? Huh?You're father and son?
Then that guy over theretried to bully me!
What was that?!
When that happened,this guy here rescued me...
He clashed with that monster...
Pretty interesting guy.
I see...
Kid... I recognize youas my henchman...
and I'll show you what dutyand respect means!
I'll make you pay the pricegood and proper, you underling!
Hang on tight!
How's that?!
Awesome...
What a guy...
He's so heavy,
I could barely manage tothrust my dagger through him.
If I don't hurry up,
this battle will changethe shape of the landscape.
Hey! Hey! Chief!
Sakura is over that way,so don't move that way!
Please lure him in this direction.
Sakura...?
That's his girlfriend, Pop.
I've got to take that guy down.
Otherwise, I won't be ableto rescue Sakura!
Interesting!
This is interesting!aruto Uzumaki!
T-This isn't good!
That Gaara...He's intending to do that thing.
I better get out of here!
Huh...? That is...
That's... the medium...?
To thank you for entertaining meup to now...
I'll show you the real power...
of the Sand Spirit!
The circles under his eyes...
Those are symptoms ofinsomnia which indicate
that the medium is also possessedby the Shukaku of the Sand.
Insomnia...?
Those who are possessedby the Demon Raccoon Shukaku
are unable to sleep soundlythrough the entire night.
Because of the terror...
If one sleeps, Shukaku will slowlyeat away at their personality
and eventually that personis no longer himself.
Because he normallydoesn't get much sleep...
the medium's personalitytends to... become unstable.
Oh...
Therefore, usually whilethe medium is awake,
the power of Shukaku isnormally controlled.
However...
when that medium sleeps...
Playing Possum Jutsu!
He's done it...!
W-What's gonna happen, Chief?
If one sets Playing Possum Jutsuinto motion...
... the Shukaku will appear!
I'm finally able to emerge!
That's the Shukaku?
He's pretty funky...
Right away!The guy I wanna kill! You!
I'm gonna jump...
Huh?
Wind Style: Air Bullets!
Water Style: Water Bullets!
That's practically a storm...
What kind of a battle is this...?!
Chief! I told you,not in that direction!
Shut up! I know!
Air Bullets!
Water Bullets!
Too bad...
This isn't good, Chief!There's one shot left...!
Yeah! I killed it...
I killed it!
That hurts...!
How dare you shoot me
with bullets containingstupid amounts of Chakra!
Even I can't take that many shots!
What should we do?!
For a start,wake up that medium kid!
It will release that Jutsu!
How do we go about waking him?!
Give him a good punch!
Water Bullets!
Like I'll take that!
Now!
Chief, I can't hit himunless you hold him down!
This Toad doesn't have fangs or clawsto hold that guy's movement.
What should we do then?!
We'll use the Transform Jutsu tochange into something that has those!
But with that said...
I'm not particularly goodat transformations.
Huh?
So you will act as my willand make the Sign!
Whaaaat?!
Time for a combined transformation!
Uh...Okay!
We got to have fangs and claws!
Umm...
Let's go!
Wait...Say, w-wait a second...!
F-Fangs and claws... Fangs and claws...Fangs and claws!
Transform!
Transform Jutsu!
That's the...!
A cycle of hardship, right?
Inside, we were crying, right?
But the one thing we won't give upis the dream we've chosen, right?
It's a secondary role,
a role in the shadows
But in reaching for that dream,
Iet us stay centered,let us stay true
Over and over,we hung on without giving up
Over and over,we kept coming back up
Over and over,we believed and dreamed
Over and over,we've seen fools
Over and over,we've stood in the shadows of others
Now, it's our turn...Let us bask in our dreams
I don't know about your past,and my past doesn't matter either!
I only have people who I must protect.
Hey you with no eyebrows!
Let's just end this as similar fighters.
I will finish this with my next hit.
This will be, absolutely and totally,the last one!
Next time:"Beyond the Limit of Darkness and Light"Yeah, turn your sadness into kindness, your uniqueness into strength
Even if you get lost, let's start walking
One more time
Are you really happy
when you're always meeting to someone's expectations?
Even if you change to who you really wanna be
Will you always have a great smile?
Dreaming of only "the beginning," I wake up
and someday, I'll live on my own.
Yes, precious things are never in shape
You never know what it is when you get it or lose it
Yeah, turn your sadness into kindness, your uniqueness into strength
Even if you get lost, let's start walking
One more time

Assassin of the Moonlit Night
T-This guy...
Sasuke!
So we were too late...
Those guys...
Sa... Sakura...?
You guys...
T-This...
He probably fought recklessly...
like that time!
Sasuke!
Kakashi Sensei said there was nothingto worry about with the bruise!
So tell me... Sakura...
Sakura!
What do you want?!
This guy... Who is he?!
His outward appearanceis different, but...
he's that guy called Gaara.
When I came into this world, I took the lifeof the woman some might call my mother.
So that I could becomethe strongest Shinobi...
my father brought his Ninjutsu upon me,
and so I became possessedby a Sand Spirit.
I was born a monster.
So that's what he was saying...
He's the one who hurt Sasuke...
Hey young girl!
I want you to know thatI'm not the fighting type!
I can see that by looking at you!
In any case,I need to get away from here
and somehow take Sasuke towhere Kakashi Sensei is!
You...
Sasuke...!
Well! Your limit is two shots...
That's about it...
The third shot won't be activated...Remember this well.
If you try to force a Jutsu to activate...
not only will the Jutsunot properly activate,
but your Chakra will deplete to zero...
and in the worst case, you'll die!
Even if you were to survive,absolutely nothing good will come of it.
Especially in your case...
Is it the Curse Mark...?
If you let your hatred take over you,
and rely on the powerof the Curse Mark...
your development will stop there.
If that happens, you won'tbe able to beat Itachi.
In any case,I need to get control over this.
Sasuke!
I see you're...
the one I failed to kill that time.
I live fighting for only myselfand loving myself...
And as long as there are others to kill...
I will never disappear.
L-Let's run! Everyone!
Die! Sasuke Uchiha!
Sakura!
Out of the way!
Sakura!
How could she standin the way of that Gaara...?
Darn! Darn!What the heck should we do?!
Just with him, I don't want to...
Now, let me feel it!
Why...?
Gaara, Please calm down.
It's no use after all...
The sand gets in the way.
Gaara...
Yashamaru!
I may not look it,
but Lord Kazekage charged meto look after your physical condition
as a member of medical corpsand to be with you.
Please do not do such thingsin front of me.
Although the sand will protect you...
Yashamaru... I'm sorry...
Oh, this..? It's just a scrape.
A scrape...
Is it painful?
A little bit... But it'll heal in no time.
Hey Yashamaru...
What is it?
What is pain?
I've... never once had a wound so...
I wondered what it's like...
Well...
How can I explain it?
It's like it's distressing, or difficult...
In other words, to be hit or cut...
Maybe I should say it's a feelingof not being able to bear it,
of not being able to stay normal...
I can't say it well,
but I suppose it means a situationthat's not very good.
Yashamaru...
Yes?
So, do you dislike me...Yashamaru?
People live their lives whilehurting others and while being hurt.
But it's not so easy forpeople to dislike others.
Thank you, Yashamaru.
I think I sort of understandwhat pain is now.
I see...
So... maybe I'm injured too?The same as everyone?
I'm always... in pain.
I'm not bleeding, but...
I've been having a lot ofpain around... here.
Blood does flow from a woundon the body
and the wound may appear painful.
But as time passes, the painnaturally disappears.
By using medicine,the healing is even faster.
But what's dangerous isa wound of the heart.
Nothing has more trouble healing.
A wound of the heart?
A wound on the body anda wound of the heart are slightly different.
Unlike a wound on the body,there is no ointment and sometimes,
it doesn't heal for one's entire life.
But there is one thing thatcan cure a wound of the heart.
However, this is a complicated medicine.
It can only be given to youby another person.
What? What must I do to...?
The thing that can curea wound of the heart.
That is...
love.
Love?
Yes.
H-How can I get it?What do I need to do for this pain to be...?
It has already been given to you, Gaara.
Huh?
Love is...a heart that desires to servea precious person who is close to oneself,
to love and watch over that person,just like my older sister did.
I believe that my older sisterloved you, Gaara.
Sand Spirit Shukaku is a spirit of a livingperson used for the purpose of attacks.
The sand which automatically tries toprotect you is like the love of a mother.
I believe that sand is filledwith your mother's will.
My sister... probably wanted toprotect you even more after dying...
Yashamaru...
What is it?
Thanks for what you did earlier...for stopping me.
You are welcome.
You are a precious personwho is near me, Gaara!
Can you understand... my pain?
It tastes like iron...
Twenty!
Twenty-one!
Leaf...Hurricane!
How many did you takedown Kakashi?
Twenty-two.
Huh, it seems I win again!
That was my twenty-third.
Yeah, yeah all right...
That poser attitude of yoursstill makes you cool!
That's the reason you are my rival!
- Let's go!- All right!
Hey, Yashamaru...I have a favor to ask!
What is it?
I want some ointment.
Sorry about earlier...It must've hurt.
This is medicine.
If you want it--
Go home...freak!
Oh, what the--?!
Hey, be careful, you brat--
Y-You are...
- Again...- Go home, freak!
These eyes...
Y-You are...
Why...? Why?!
H-Hey!
What the--? What's going on?
It's... it's Gaara!
Hey! This guy's dead.
Father...
As I thought... Things don't go well...
Why is it...that only I'm such a freak?!
What...am l?!
The thing that can curea wound of the heart is love.
Yashamaru!
Huh?
Why? Why me...?
Why always me?!
Who...? Why...?
Well done... Gaara.
Yashamaru...!
It's those eyes...
What's the matter?Weren't you gonna run away?
Sasuke...
Naruto...
What are these two... to you?!
T-These two are... my friends!
Try laying so much asanother finger on them!
I'll clobber you!
So...what's the matter?!Weren't you gonna clobber me?
Hurry up and come at me...
Darn it!
Everyone makes mistakesIt's nothing to be ashamed about
Don't let this scar be for naughtWalk with a smile
Yes, breathe in the airLift your face to the sky and jump
If it rains, take a breakGo where the wind takes you

Everyone makes mistakesIt's nothing to be ashamed about
Don't let this scar be for naughtWalk with a smile
Transform sadness into the windand continue to forge on
Forge on strong
I know this guy's strength.
I may seem like a senselessweakling to him.
But... what's...?What's this feeling welling up inside me?
I don't know...
I don't know,but I just don't want to lose to this guy!

Where do you think you are going following someone else's map?
An insightful crow comes along to tear up the map
Now open your eyes and take a look at the truth (Yeah!)
There's nothing to lose, so let's GO!!!
We are Fighting Dreamers aiming high
Fighting Dreamers don't care what people think about them
Fighting Dreamers follow what they believe
Oli Oli Oli Oh! Just go my way
Right here right now (Bang!) Hit it straight like a line drive!
Right here right now (Burn!) We're gonna do it and do our best!
Right here right now (Bang!) Hit it straight like a line drive!
Right here right now (Burn!) We're gonna do it and do our best! BANG!
For a start, wake upthat medium kid.
It will release that Jutsu!
How do we go about waking him?!
Give him a good punch!
But with that said...
I'm not particularly goodat transformations...
Huh?
So you will act as my willand make the Sign!
Time for a combined transformation!
We got to have fangs and claws!Let's go!
Transform!
Beyond the Limit of Darkness and Light
F-Fox...?
What a battle...
I can't call this place safe either, huh...
Darn it!
His power is increasingmore and more!
Chief! We got to hurry up and rousethat guy out of his sleep!
I know that!
Here goes...!
Go to hell!
All right! Now!
Okay!
Wake the hell up!
You jerk...
All right!
Not that much time has passedsince the medium went to sleep!
In that state,one blow should be enough!
Darn!
It hasn't been long since I emerged!
The Jutsu has been dissolved!
Even if the Playing Possum Jutsuis dissolved,
he's still putting on the pressure?
That guy interfered with my Jutsu...?!
Sand Coffin!
- Pop!- Yeah!
It's the chief's tongue...
Don't take me for a fool!
Darn!
What kind of strengthdoes this guy possess?
This doesn't look good...!
Both Naruto and I have alreadycompletely disgorged our Chakra!
You will be killed by me!I will not cease to exist!
Leaf Hurricanes!
Besides just the Sound Ninja,I wouldn't have imagined that
this many of the Sand Joninwould enter into the village, too!
Well, it's understandable.This is what is called war.
It's taking much too long.
It's impossible for a battlebetween Shinobi to last this long.
What the heck is happening inside?
You're still grabbing my arm...
I can't use my Jutsu this way...
Come on,let go of me once and for all.
I'm not letting your ambitionsinterfere with the village... any longer...
There's no stopping my ambitions!You will die here!
You old dotard...
As the Third Hokage,
are you saying you still havethe power to save this village?
Do you understand...the current situation?!
Many Hidden Sand Shinobi andmy subordinates
have infiltrated this village.
Your side... the Leaf Shinobi...
will be annihilated down toevery last woman and child!
I will accomplish the destructionof the Hidden Leaf Village!
It's empty inside!
There's nobody there!
That's very strange...
Huh?
Why is there so little resistancewhen we've closed in
all the way to the centerof the Hidden Leaf Village?
That's...
And also...there's not one womanor child in sight.
What is the reason for that?
Huh?!
Konohamaru...?
What's the matter, Konohamaru?
I gotta use the toilet.
M-Me too...
I do too...
K-Konohamaru...!
This is an emergency situation!
If the enemy finds us,it will cost us!
Go back to the other roomand stay quiet!
I-It's not that... I gotta pee!
Hold it!
I don't think I can hold it...
Gimme a break.In that case, come along with me...
Can't hold it!
Can't! Can't hold...!
That's...
At last, huh...
I'll get revenge for youno matter what...
Hayate.
That's the signal. Let's go!
Roger!
You don't get it, do you, Orochimaru?
Don't underestimate the Shinobiof this Village!
Are you all right?
Yeah...
Is that... the last?
Yes, the evacuation is complete!
W-What's happening?
The Village Hidden in the Leaveshas an instruction manual
outlining what to do in case ofa sneak attack by the enemy.
Step One:Eliminate the enemy's sneak attack force.
In case one is unableto eliminate them,
proceed immediately to Step Two.
The immediate evacuationof noncombatants!
Evacuate the women and childrento shelters around the village!
When that has been completed,proceed to Step Three!
Step Three...?
Through the collective strengthand efforts of the Village,
eliminate the enemy!
In that case...!
The counteroffensive... starts now!
We will not allow you to takeeven one step beyond this point!
Sakura!
Rescue Sakura,if it's the last thing you do!
I'll protect Sakura no matter what!
You will be killed by me.I will not cease to exist.
My back is against the wall...
I have to hurry upand stop that Demon Raccoon...
Please...
Just a small amount is fine...
Give me...
some Chakra!
What are you doing...?There's only one opponent!
Hyuga is the magnum forceof the Leaf Village.
Don't forget that!
M-My... body... is immobilized...
Is this the first timeyou're experiencing
the Leaf's hidden technique,Shadow Paralysis Jutsu?
Well, take this too while I'm at it...
The Leaf's hidden technique...Shadow Strangle Jutsu!
Expansion Jutsu!
Mind Destruction Jutsu!
W-What's this?!
My body is... all on its own...!
S-Stop...
Stop!
Reminds me of the old days!
Yeah!
The original Ino-Shika-Cho Trio reunites!
Kuromaru... let's go!
Right!
In order to protect the village,
all the Leaf Shinobi will risktheir lives fighting!
Real strength doesn't liein the mastering of all Jutsu!
The poison in my body is...
Don't move, Shino.I inserted my Parasitic Insects.
They are removing the poison.
Dad...
I believe I taught thisto you too, in the past...
It is when one protectssomeone important...
that the true strength ofthe Shinobi will emerge!
I will protect everyone!
Here I come! You idiot raccoon!
Die...!
Darn...
Darn it!
D-Did he win...?
A simple head blow...
His manner of fightingis incredibly clumsy,
but to think that he could squeeze outChakra at that critical stage.
I've never seen a knucklehead Ninjalike him before, but...
he sure is the first phenomenal kidI've seen in a long time.
It's too bad that I can't see this throughto the end,
but I've reached my limit.
Gamakichi, let's head home!
Okay! Pop!
As might be expected, even l...am empty now...
You are too, aren't you?
We're much alike...let's make this time the last!
It appears that...
I don't have the strength leftto yank out your entire soul.
However, your ambition ends here!
Not yet!
There's no stopping my ambition!
I have a suitable punishment for you
who have become addicted to the Jutsuand who have overindulged in the Jutsu!
I will take all your Jutsu away with me!
What did you say?!
There!
Don't tell me that..?
Stop that!
Seal!
My... My arms...
Now... you can no longer useeither of your arms.
And since you can't use your arms,you can't weave Signs.
You no longer possess Ninjutsu!
Your ambition of crushingthe Hidden Leaf...dies right here!
You old dotard!Give me back my arms!
Orochimaru, you fool...
It's unfortunate thatwe can't leave together,
but, my disciple...
let's meet in the other world one day.
You old dotard...whose life is hanging by a thread!
How dare you!How dare you take away my Jutsu!
In places where the Leaf dances,a fire burns...
The shadow of the firewill illuminate the Village...
And once more the Leaf will sprout...
A cycle of hardship, right?
Inside, we were crying, right?
But the one thing we won't give upis the dream we've chosen, right?
It's a secondary role,
a role in the shadows
But in reaching for that dream,
let us stay centered,let us stay true
Over and over,we hung on without giving up
Over and over,we kept coming back up
Over and over,we believed and dreamed
Over and over,we've seen fools
Over and over,we've stood in the shadows of others
Now, it's our turn...Let us bask in our dreams
Lord Third Hokage...
The ambition that you hadseems to have been passed on
to the young Shinobiin the Village Hidden in the Leaves.
The flame in their hearts willburn large and strong in the future.
And someday,they will illuminate this Village...
just as you have done for us!
Next time:"The Third Hokage, Forever..."Yeah, turn your sadness into kindness, your uniqueness into strength
Even if you get lost, let's start walking
One more time
Are you really happy
when you're always meeting to someone's expectations?
Even if you change to who you really wanna be
Will you always have a great smile?
Dreaming of only "the beginning," I wake up
and someday, I'll live on my own.
Yes, precious things are never in shape
You never know what it is when you get it or lose it
Yeah, turn your sadness into kindness, your uniqueness into strength
Even if you get lost, let's start walking
One more time

Sasuke's Decision:Pushed to the Edge!
There you are!
I'm here!
I'm returning them to you!
So it's a clone...
Bastard!
Sasuke... Uchiha...!
Why won't you come at me?!
Why...
do you flee?!
Ready?
Over here!
Over here!
Wait!
Pass!
Here! Good one!
Good! Go! Go! Go!
Power shot!
What're we gonna do?
We don't know any wall-climbingtechniques or anything...
Y-You're...
This...
It's Gaara...
Gaara of Sand...
R-Run!
Wait!
Don't leave me alone!
Help me!
I don't...
want to be alone anymore!
Really...
No!
Gaara! Please calm down!
Yashamaru...
No escape!
I won't let you escape!Sasuke Uchiha!
You've gotta be kidding!What's with that outrageous strength...?
Are you afraid of me?
It's too overwhelming...
Sasuke Uchiha! Are you afraid?Are you afraid of my existence?!
Don't forget...You are my prey.
Wait!
Why are you fixatedon me so much?
Those eyes that know true loneliness...
And eyes that know thatit is the world's greatest suffering...
I think I told you.
That you have the same eyes as me.
Eyes that lust for power,
overflowing with hatredand murderous intent...
The same as me...
Eyes that burn to kill thosewho drove you...
into a hell called loneliness!
Such are your eyes.
Okay. Just a minute.
So you're called Gaara...
I don't know what you knowabout Sasuke, but...
It's not good for you tospeak as though
you perceive everything about Sasuke!
What is it that you want to sayto him before the final round,
by pursuing him so far?
A battle is where...
another's existence and one's ownexistence are put on the line...
and each tries to kill the other!
Only the winner can actually feelthe value of his own existence.
In other words,what you want to say is...
let's have a killing bout andnot a match?
Uchiha... You really shouldbe wanting it, too...
in the depths of your soul...
You want to confirmthe value of your existence.
Am I really, truly powerful?
Is my existence more powerfulthan my opponent
who faces me with eyesfilled with intent to kill?
What's the matter?!
Sasuke Uchiha!
Are you afraid of me?!
Your hatred and intent to kill...
have they given way to fear?
Is that the extent of your existence?!
Fight me...and confirm it!
Your value! Your existence!
Experience it!
If you want an answer...
Come at me!
I was allowed to live...
Only...myself.
Expressly for what reason?!
No... I know the reason.
The reason that man left me alivewas so he wouldn't be tormented
by a sense of guilt for having killedan entire clan...
Itachi chose me as the avenger...in order to have me kill him!
Now, let me have some fun...Sasuke Uchiha!
I'll finish it with one blow!
Hurry up and die,release yourself from your misery.
You silly old fool...
I believe I told you...that you would die too!
Bastard!
Let go, you old fool!
I will not let go!I refuse to let go...
until I have pulled out your soul!
At this rate...
Gaara!
Looks like it worked...
I see! That's what it was!
That's not possible...
He countered Gaara's attackin that condition?!
I just realized the reason...why it's so fun!
This pain...
To take down an opponentwho wounded me...
and thoroughly destroy him...!
That will make me truly feel alive!
Gaara's never had a single wound,but he got Gaara twice.
Is he...a freak?!
No...a true freak is...
After all, the only thing Gaara istransforming is still just his right arm.
More, more!
What?!
What the heck is this guy?!
One after another...
Here goes!
He's even faster!
I can't dodge unlessI read ahead of his movements.
If I didn't have these eyesI'd have died long ago.
I can no longer use Chidori...
Fire Style...Fire Ball Jutsu!
So the Fire Style doesn'twork against sand...
Not only that,this level of Jutsu won't...
Die!
Apparently...it needs to be Chidori!
Well! Your limit is two shots.That's about it...
This is as many Chidoriyou can shoot in one day
with your present Chakra.
After all, this Chidori is a techniquethat can only be used
in conjunction with Sharinganduring actual battles.
But using Sharingan andanother Jutsu simultaneously means
exploding and using up the Chakrain your body all at once.
Well! But you really areone of the more impressive ones.
Even with my Chidori...
If I use the Lightning Bladefour times in a day,
I'd completely use up my Chakra.
What would happen if I triedto use more than two shots?
The third shot won't be activated...
Remember this well!
If you try to force a Jutsu to activate...
not only will the Jutsunot properly activate,
but your Chakra will deplete to zero...
And in the worst case, you'll die!
Even if you were to survive,absolutely nothing good will come of it.
Especially in your case.
What's the matter?
Does the value of your existenceamount to only this much?
I'll be blunt...
You are...weak!
You're too optimistic.
And it's because your hatredis weak!
The power of hatred isthe power of the intent to kill!
The power of the intent to killis the power of revenge!
Your hatred is weaker than mine!
Shut up...
Do you understandthe meaning of this?!
Shut up!
That means that you...You are weaker than me!
Itachi chose me to be the avenger...to have me kill him!
I am an avenger!
The Curse Mark again...
Darn...! My body...
Sasuke!
Everyone makes mistakesIt's nothing to be ashamed about
Don't let this scar be for naughtWalk with a smile
Yes, breathe in the airLift your face to the sky and jump
If it rains, take a breakGo where the wind takes you
So many regretsDon't let this scar be for naught
Let's go carve the badges in our chestYes, it's Show Time, life begins now.
Everyone makes mistakesIt's nothing to be ashamed about
Don't let this scar be for naughtWalk with a smile
Transform sadness into the windand continue to forge on
Forge on strong
Hey Yashamaru,what does pain feel like?
I don't know becauseI've never been injured...
I was wondering what it's like.
Could it be that I'm hurt?
I'm not bleeding, but my chest'sfelt weird for a long time.
It feels stifled and it hurts a lot!
Next time:"Assassin of the Moonlit Night"Press down hard on the gas
That's right, there's no compromise
We'll slip through the night
At the final moment push hard
That's right, all the way to zero,
Until we wipe away the days
Gently open your heart
If you pull it close to you
It will reach you, without a doubt
It will come, closer
Now
We're speeding through life,squeezing it for all of its worth
Our feet are tied
But we still keep going farther
Even if I take it back, and grasp it
If you're not the one
There will be no meaning
And so we'll go far off into the distance.

I'll show you there are walls
which effort alone cannever break through.
Sakura Blossoms!
Huh?!
Your Jutsu is indeed fast.
But our Jutsu exceeds thatand is the speed of sound!
Lee!
My left ear...
There's a little gimmick I have.
Evading won't work...on my attacks.
What is he going to do?!
It's sound.
Even though you evaded my fist,sound assaulted you.
Sound?
Do you know what sound isall about in the first place?
Vibration?
Correct. I n other words,hearing sounds means,
that the eardrum iscatching vibrating air.
And the human eardrum breakswith sounds over 1 50 Mhz.
Also, by assaulting the semicircular canalwhich is located even deeper,
I can make you totally lose balance.
You won't be able to move your bodyfreely for some time.
Something old and tiredlike Taijutsu don't work on us.
Well, you were doing goodup to a certain point,
but I brought forth my Jutsu.
It's just not gonna work anymore.
I freely manipulate ultrasonic wavesand air pressure,
and have the power toobliterate even boulders!
Primary Lotus!
I can send air into the ground
and change the dirt intoa cushion as I please.
It's different fromyour silly Jutsu.
Blast it!
Lee, it is all right to usethis Jutsu
to protect someone precious.
Protect...someone precious?
In any case,
I'm impressed that youwere able to master it, little man!
You did it quite well, Lee!
Darn it!
Okay, then!
Next is...
You!
Darn it!
He's coming!
What?!
No way!
Lee!
Leaf...
Hurricane!
It looks like my earlier attackis having an effect!
I'm somewhat surprised...
but there's not even a trace ofthat flash of combo Taijutsu you showed!
This arm amplifies soundsfrom within to its maximum.
It's a speaker of sorts!
Lee!
And the assault sound isn't limitedby the direction of my arm...
it always converges onthe targeted prey by my Chakra!
Lee!
Now then...The final blow.
I won't let you!
Oh, well.
Hey, let's get outta here!
Those guys are pretty dangerous!
It looks like Sasuke and Narutoare only unconscious, but...
even that guy Lee's beenmessed up and Sakura's alone.
What're you gonna do, Ino?
What do you mean?
Well, Sakura's in deep trouble!
You're all right with that?
Huh?!
You two were once close friends,weren't you?
By the way...
What Sakura, don't be so stiff!
Well...
Ino, I hear you also...
What is it?
... like Sasuke.
Then, that means from now on,
you and I are rivals.
Why... why am I recalling thingsfrom that time?
Hey, I no!
What're you gonna do?!
I know, but there's nothing I can do!
I can't heedlesslygo out there, can l?!
Even if I went out now...
I'd be taken down without a doubt.
I also...
I also...!
Air pressure!The shurikens got bounced back?!
Your hair's shinier than mine.
Hey! If you have time to worryabout your hair,
you should practice!
Getting all spiced up like a woman...
Why don't you kill that Sasuke guyright in front of this sexy bug, Zaku?
Yeah! That sounds great!
Hey hey...
I won't let you do such a thing!
Don't move!
Sakura.
My body... It has no strength.
I...
Again... I'm just pulling everyone's feet!
I'm always being protected.
It's so frustrating!
This time for sure...I had thought!
This time for sure...
I must protect people precious to me...so I thought!
So...
Let's do this!
Hey! Sasuke and Naruto aregonna get it, too!
W-What should I do?!
That's pointless!
That won't work on me!
What are you saying?
Huh?
What?!
I always...
act as if I'm a full-fledged Ninja.
I always say that I like Sasuke.
I always act like I know everythingand lecture Naruto.
I always just... watch them from behind.
And yet...
Tazuna, get back!
Get back!
Now then...
Let's get wild!
This is the only way totake him down!
Sasuke!
Here it is!
Those two always coveredmy back and fought for me.
Lee, you say that you like me...
I'll protect you until I die!
Primary Lotus!
With me at your back...
you risked your life andfought for me.
I have a feeling that you taught me...
Sakura!
Sakura!
Humph!
I want to be like all of you!
This time...
I want all of you...
to watch me...
... from behind!
Sakura?
Sakura...
Kin! Kill her!
Huh! That sign...
Substitution Jutsu!
On the right, huh?You think I'm a fool?
With such a simple and basic Ninjutsu...
you think you can come at me?!
Kin, get out of the way!
Useless!
Air pressure 1 00 percent,ultrasonic waves 0%, output...
Is that all you can do?
Slicing Sound Wave!
You're easy to spot...
You're above!
I've said it two or three times thatthat won't work!
This is enough...for you!
Where next?
Huh?!
What...?!
This time...it's not a substitution!
Get off me! Hey!
Sakura...
You're always being called"Billboard Brow" and being picked on.
Who're you?
I'm called Ino Yamanaka.How 'bout you?
I'm... Sakura.
Huh? I can't hear you.Say it louder.
Sakura Haruno!
Huh, I see.
You have a wide forehead.
So, Billboard Brow, huh...?
That's why you hideyour forehead with your bangs.
Like a ghost...
Sakura, was it?
Uh-huh...
Come back here tomorrow.
I'll give you something nice.
Huh?
Darn, let go!
See! You look cuter like this, Sakura!
I'll give you that ribbon.
T-Thanks.
But...
But what?
My forehead...
You hide it, so people makemore fun of you, you know?!
You have a cute face Sakura,so you should be more confident!
More confident!
Ino...
Hey, who's that?Who's she, Ino?
Her name's Sakura.
Hey, say hello!
Hello...
Listen everybody! Listen!
There's someone I like!Who do you think it is?
Hurry up and tell us!
Don't say it's Sasuke?
Huh? Why'd you know?
What're you talking about?
Sasuke's really popular,he's the most popular!
Huh? Is that so?
Oh no! I'll have a lot of rivals.What should I do?!
Hey, Ino! Sakura 's been upbeat lately!
She's just acting braveand romping around!
Ino! I've heard Sasukelikes girls with long hair.
... likes girls with long hair.... likes girls with long hair.
Sakura...
I've heard you like Sasuke, too, Ino.
From now on, we're rivals.
Your hair. It's grown quite a bit.
Ino...
Why...
Why are you on thesame team as Sasuke?!
I will not lose anymore... to you, Ino!
Me too! I won't lose to you, Sakura.o matter what!
... Sakura!
I will...
I will...
Give it up!
It's really bad...
Hey, I no...!
I must...protect everyone!
You punk!
Huh?
Huh! More strange ones.
Ino...?
Sakura! I promisedI wouldn't lose to you, didn't l?!
Hey, can you hear it?
The clear, blue sky goes on and on
The ocean spans limitlessly
Please keep that smile on your face forever
Or else I'll cry
You won't have to search around you
It's all ok now.
Everyone is insidethis hand
when you want to cry, and you want to run away
When you forget what happiness is
Just sing.
Light is born, and darkness was born
The two are one
Harmonia, feel the telepathy
Hey, can you hear it?
Wow! This is Ino team's battle?!
What a formation based on calculations!
I hate to admit it,but they're strong!
Even the Sound Village oneswould be no match for them!
We'll protect Sasuke...
Huh?! What's this feeling?
Next episode: "Battle Formation:Ino-Shika-Cho!"
What in the world is going on?!
C'mon!
Running like a fugitive,
Being chased by something
Inside my heart is pounding
My throat dry like it's withering
For no single one,
To none does belong,
This time is ours, right now...
Unraveling the pain,
Unraveling our hearts,
Unraveling shadows
Stifling our breath,
Reaching for beyond,
Tearing through the dark
In fighting and in love
To the distant light above,
Yes, we are on the way
I wanna rock...
Rockin' my heart
Naruto and others areout there fighting!
We should be too!
The Weapon Knownas Shinobi
Old man!
Old Man Giichi!
Please open up!
Let's go to the bridge!
If we all do it together,
we can beat Gato andhis men this time!
Inari...
I made up my mind notto fight anymore.
Even your father...
The man we called a hero...
He's not with us anymore.
If we were to fight,many lives would be lost.
I don't want lose something that'sspecial to me anymore.
No one wants to regret again.
I...
I don't want to regret again, either.
That's why we must fight!
A man should livehis life without regrets.
I love Mommy and Grampa.
And you too, Old Man Giichi!
I love all the people here!
I finally realized...
Nothing is accomplished ifI just cry all the time!
I finally got it!
Inari... has grown intoa fine man.
Will you just let Inari gothere by himself?
Open up!
Hey!
I'm asking you to fight with me!
Old man! Please listen to me!
Why...
Why won't anyone openthe door to me?
You are strong!
Naruto...
Zabuza.
You were too full of yourself.
You're too ambitious for your own good.
You assassinated the Mizukage,but failed to pull off a coup.
You left the service withfew men under you,
and became a Rogue Ninja.
Soon after, your name reachedour Hidden Leaf Village.
You needed to raise fundsto strike back.
And you needed to hide
from the T racking Unit'spursuit and retaliation.
Isn't that about the reason why
you hired yourself outto scum like Gato?
Zabuza...
Do you really believe I've managedto survive with just Sharingan?
Here's something I didn't copy,a technique of my own...
to enlighten you!
Lightning Blade!
What the...?!
His hand is...visibly overflowing with Chakra!
You are too dangerous.
Tazuna, the man you are tryingto assassinate,
is the symbol of couragein this land!
The bridge he is buildingis the hope of this land!
And your ambitions willsacrifice countless lives.
That isn't howa Shinobi is supposed to behave.
Who cares?
I have always fought formy own ideals.
And that will never ever change!
I'll say it again.
Huh?
Give up.
Your future is...death!
Naruto...
I want you to kill me.
Please, make it quick.
What are you hesitating for?
I just don't get it!
The only reason you are allowedto live is because you stay strong?
There must be something otherthan just fighting...
There must be some other way
for you to makethe others accept you!
Remember when we met at the forest?Do you know what I thought?
That you and I are much alike.
I'm sure you can relate to me.
I apologize for dirtyingyour hands with my blood.
Is that it?
Is there really no other way?
No.
If only...we had met underdifferent circumstances,
we could've been friends.
Please...promise you willgrasp your dream.
He too...
Sasuke also had dreams of his own!
Thank you...You will become stronger.
Hmm...
The super thick foghas finally begun to clear.
There are two over there!
They are facing off each other.
Huh?
I can't see well...
Which one is Kakashi Sensei...
One moved!
Huh?
Forgive me, Naruto...
I cannot die yet!
Is this the end...?
What was that?
Zabuza...
Did you say my futurewas death?
You're off the mark again, Kakashi!
No...
You're not to go to the bridge alone!
I went all over the town,but no one wants to come.
I have no choice!
But...
Wait!You're just a child!
I may be a child, but I alreadyknow what it means to fight.
Because I'm my father's son!
My dear...
Wait a moment, Inari!
Where did he go...?
I didn't notice,but the fog is starting to lift...
Huh? Is he over there?
Huh?!
What the heck is going on here?!
Isn't that the masked boy?
I didn't expect him to jump into save Zabuza...
The boy...is already dead.
You did great, Haku.
Kakashi Sensei!
He intends to slash mealong with the boy?!
That was really a great find I made!
Even in his final moment,
he gave me sucha perfect opportunity!
Haku, bad news.
I have to leaveLand of Water as of tonight.
However, I'll returnto this land someday.
I will rule over this land.
To do that,
what I need isn't consolation,encouragement or empty words.
What I really need is...
I already know.
You have nothing to fear.
I am your weapon, Zabuza.
Keep me by you as a mere toolthat heeds your every word.
You're a good boy!
Haku died and you wereable to move, huh?
I won't forgive you!
Naruto!
You just stay there and watch!
This is...
my battle!
Naruto...
Naruto!It's good to see you!
Sakura...
Where's Sasuke?
Naruto!Where is Sasuke?
Sakura...
Kakashi!
You have no time to takeyour eyes off me!
Why don't I go with you?
That way, you won't be goingagainst your Sensei's word.
Right...
Sasuke...
Huh?!
He's cold.
This isn't Genjutsu, is it?
Don't mind me.
This isn't the time tohold back your emotions...
I-I always got perfect scoresat the Ninja Academy...
Huh?
I memorized all thehundreds of Shinobi rules.
All the tests were a breeze.
Until one day,this question came up...
State Rule # 25 ofthe Ways of the Shinobi...
As always, I simply wrote downthe answer without batting an eye.
"A Shinobi must nevershow his true feelings
under any circumstances,no matter what...
The mission always comes first.
A Ninja must have the strengthof character never to shed any tears..."
Is this..how it must be for a Shinobi?
That is so unbearably painful...
Sasuke...
Why...?Why can't I keep up?
Darn you!
Why you...!
You can't possibly defeat methe way you are now.
What was that?
You still don't know...What true strength means!
Let's see how things are going...
Goodbye, Demon!
Both your arms havenow been disabled.
You can't even weave a sign.
Huh?
Oh!You really got it this time.
You disappoint me, Zabuza.
Huh?! You!
What the heckare you doing?!
Don't you have anythingto say, Zabuza?!
He was your comrade, right?!
You were always,always together, weren't you?
He really liked you, you know!
You really don't feel anything?!

Darn it! Things will really be badif it stays like this...!
I'll have to...
I'll have to save...everyone for sure!
Light vs. Dark:The Two Faces of Gaara!
So you'll fight for the sake of others?!
That's why you guys areonly at that level!
You don't need a reason to fight!
Only the one who remains undefeatedcan actually feel his own existence!
Come on, forget aboutyour insignificant friends
and fight only for the sakeof your own existence!
Insignificant...
friends?
Those who hold silly sentimentsabout fighting
should just die!
I'm sick of listening to you talk!
I'll clobber you for sure!
You guys misunderstand real strength!
Shut up!
W-Why...? Why is it?!
Why Yashamaru...?
Why did you, why...?
Why...?
Love is...
a heart that desires to servea precious person who is close to oneself,
to love and watch over that person.
Just like my older sister did.
You are a precious personwho is close to me, Gaara!
Always...only Yashamaru would always...
Me... always me...
It was an order.
I was commissioned to kill you...
By your father...
Lord Kazekage.
My father...?
Why did my father...?
Why...? Why me?
Gaara, you who were born and possessedby the Sand Spirit Shukaku...
have been watched overas an experiment.
However, Gaara, you couldn'tcontrol the living spirit Shukaku,
the Sand Spirit which possessesthe power of the sand.
Eventually your existence wouldbecome too dangerous for the village.
Before that occurred...
So Yashamaru, you had not choice...
but to comply with my father's order...?
No... That is not correct.
It is true I acceptedLord Kazekage's order.
But if I had wanted to turn it down,I could have turned it down.
Gaara...
Deep down in my heart,I probably...
hated you.
You, whose birth took the lifeof my beloved older sister.
The child she left behind in death...
Thinking that you were her remembrance,I tried desperately to love you.
However... I was not able to.
My sister didn't choose to have you.
My sister became a sacrificefor the village,
and she died whilecursing this village!
From that time, I probably...
have been burdened with a woundof the heart that could never heal.
Unlike a wound on the body,there is no ointment and sometimes,
it doesn't heal for one's entire life.
A wound of the heart?
Your name...is the name my sister gave you.
"This child's name is Gaara...
"A devil that loves only itself...
"Love only yourself...
"And fight only foryour own sake.
"If you do that,you will continue to exist!"
Such was the hope it contained.
However...
my sister did not give you this name
because she was concernedabout you or loved you.
The reason she gave you this name,a name so you would continue to exist...
...was so that the deep-seated hatredof my sister
who died hating and cursingthis village...
would remain...
and be known to all!
You were never... loved!
This is the last...
Please die...
I believe that my sister loved you, Gaara.
Love?
The sand automatically trying toprotect you is like the love of a mother.
I believe that sand is filledwith your mother's will.
Love.
Love only yourself.
And fight only for your own sake.
So that is Gaara...That is me.
I finally understand.
I am alone.
I will no longer believe in anyone...or love anyone.
I am alone!
Yes, I am all by myself.
What's the matter?Hurry up and come at me!
Don't you care what happensto your so-called precious friends?!
Sakura!
Dang it!
Naruto's not his usual self...
Did something happen between them?
In any case...
In any case,I need to save Sakura!
But... what to do?!
That's it!
Since it's come to this...Though it's gonna use up a lot of Chakra...
There's no choicebut to summon the Chief Gamabunta!
Summoning Jutsu!
What's this?! You're a little kid!
If you want something from me,give me some snack!
If you don't, I won't play with you!
You know something?I hate you frogs!
What did you say?!Don't make fun of amphibians! Really!
Jeez, I don't have time toplay with you, little squirt!
Darn! Why is it...?
I practiced for so long, but with this,there's no other way...
I need to save everyone!
Everyone... you say?
Don't make me laugh.
I fight... only for myself!
He...he's transforming again!
If you don't take me down,the sand over this girl won't fall away!
Not only that, as time passes...
this sand will slowly squeeze tighterand eventually suffocate this girl!
Sakura!
He's getting closer and closerto being a Perfect Possession.
That Jutsu hasn't been activated yet,
but at this rate, I'll also be...!
Those eyes...
Sand Shuriken!
You're... really weak!
Shut up!
But what is that guy?
You're persistent...Sarutobi Sensei!
I-It doesn't move?!
Y-You hard-to-kill fools!
Do you still not understand, Orochimaru?
The Leaf Village is my home!
I told you I am the pillarof that house!
That's why I'm sayingI will break that pillar!
As long as the people of the village
fiercely fight to protecttheir dear comrades,
the pillar of the Leaf Village will notbe broken by the likes of you!
I wonder about that.
Do not underestimate the Hokage!
I-Impossible...!
Where is...?Most of your Chakra should be gone!
Chakra and Ninjutsu arenot all there is to strength!
W-What lonely eyes...
Such lonely eyes...
This guy is also turning into a monster...the same as me.
I hated every last one of them.
I didn't understand who I was,
why I was so hated,why I even existed.
In other words,
you're the Nine-Tailed Fox who killedIruka's parents and ruined the village!
You've been deceived by everyonein the village all along!
I...
When I learned that theine-Tailed Fox was inside me,
everyone in the village seemedeven more cold-hearted...
I was so deeply troubled...
But...
Naruto! Let's go haveramen for a change!
Yay! I will, I will!
I'll have the one withextra BBQ pork slices!
Huh! You loser...If you want to beat me train harder!
Shut up! I won't lose to you!
Hey Naruto!What did Sasuke say about me?
He didn't say anything...
By the way! By the way!Wouldn't you rather know how I feel...?
Oh! Really, Sakura!
I'm gonna eat now!
Um... Naruto, you'll really die if you eatonly noodles and sweet red bean porridge.
You're a Ninja,so eat more vegetables!
Here, have some!
What?! I don't like vegetables!
People appearedwho acknowledged me...
That's why I became all right,
even though there wasthe demon fox inside my body,
or even if the people of the villagelooked at me with cold eyes.
Because...I wasn't alone anymore!
I never imagined how happy andfortunate I could feel.
How really...really...
great it was.
How truly great it wasto be here.
I was relieved to knowI am allowed to be here, to exist!
That's why it scares meto think about the past...
That suffering is agonizing...
It's a pitch-black hell!
If...I had remained that way, all alone...
That's precisely why I understand!
So what did I have in this life,why did I keep living?
This is the answer I came to...
I am living in order to killhuman beings other than myself.
I don't know what happened, but...
This guy's always beensuffering all alone...
Even now, without ever feeling relief...
Only able to believe in himself...
Even now, he's battling in hell...
That's how it is...
To him, someone like mewho's acknowledged by others...
might seem like a weakling ina world of happiness without tension...
Can I really win againsta guy like this?
What's the matter?!Are you afraid of me?
To fight for the sake of oneself?To fight for the sake of others?
You should just love yourself,and fight for yourself!
That is the definition ofthe strongest one!
Now fight me!
What happened tothe boldness you had earlier?!
Show me your strength!I'll throw that strength to the ground!
Now what's the matter?!If you don't fight me, I'll kill that girl!
Darn it!
Multi-Shadow Clone Jutsu!
Wind Style!
Infinite Sandstorm Devastation!
This isn't good...He really got me.
First, I'll toy with youwithout killing you!
I look forward to seeingwhen and how you give up
and abandon your friends!
Naruto...
But...what is it?
It's far from over!
N-Naruto...
What is this...this feeling?
Sand Shuriken!
D-Dang it!
Dang it!
H-He's...
What is this?!This feeling that's overcoming me?
Naruto...!
For some reason...I don't want to lose to this guy...
You...
...even if I die!
Everyone makes mistakesIt's nothing to be ashamed about
Don't let this scar be for naughtWalk with a smile
Yes, breathe in the airLift your face to the sky and jump
If it rains, take a breakGo where the wind takes you
So many regretsDon't let this scar be for naught
Let's go carve the badges in our chestYes, it's Show Time, life begins now.
Everyone makes mistakesIt's nothing to be ashamed about
Don't let this scar be for naughtWalk with a smile
Transform sadness into the windand continue to forge on
Forge on strong
Hear! Hear! Hear! Hear!
If you're far away,listen well.
If you're closer,then come and watch it!
Among all the Genin in the Leaf,
I'm the only one who'ssuited to become Hokage!
I turn the biggest pinchinto opportunity
with Transform Jutsu, Summoning Jutsu,and Shadow Clone Jutsu.
I give back twice as muchwhen I receive a punch.
I'm the hyperactive knucklehead Ninja!
This is the start of the spiraling seriesof Naruto's Ninja Handbook!
Next time: "Naruto's Ninja Handbook"Press down hard on the gas
That's right, there's no compromise
We'll slip through the night
At the final moment push hard
That's right, all the way to zero,
Until we wipe away the days
Gently open your heart
If you pull it close to you
It will reach you, without a doubt
It will come, closer
Now
We're speeding through life,squeezing it for all of its worth
Our feet are tied
But we still keep going farther
Even if I take it back, and grasp it
If you're not the one
There will be no meaning
And so we'll go far off into the distance.

Guy Sensei...please allow it.
It is now...
A time to carry through and protectone's own Way of the Ninja!
The Fifth Gate: A Splendid Ninja is Born
The color of his body changed...!
He's red...?!
What's up with him...?!
He's opened the third gate,the Gate of Life...
He's going to make his move!
No, not yet!
What?!
And also,
the fourth gate,the Gate of Pain...open!
What an incredible guy...
It's not as though effort alonecan make this happen...
That boy...
is he in fact a genius...?
He's fast!
Gaara!
Where are they?!
He's above!
But we can't find Lee!
Where?!
The sand isn't keeping up at all!
So it's the Sand Armor again...?
Then how's this?!
What...?!
This Sand Armor is...
being peeled away...!
You're a stubborn one.
Since it comes to this...
The muscles have torn...
Is that really Lee...?
When did he become like this...?
This is the end!
The Fifth Gate of Closing...open!
I can't defend myself...
Is this the movement ofa human being?!
Neji...
This technique is my ace inthe hole to take you down...
but I will specially show it to you!
Huh?!
The Sand Shield can't keep up!
Most of the armor has alsobeen peeled off...
He's done for!
W-Wow!
Hidden Lotus... In other words...
it's a high-speed continuousTaijutsu that can't even be touched!
The answer to take Neji down isthat high speed combination...
There is no way thatthe sand can keep up!
This technique will be the last!
Hidden Lotus!
I can't see anything, it's too fast...
That's impossible...
The gourd has turned to sand...?
He's done it this time!
Gaara!
Lee...
Oh!
What's...that?
He protects himself...
using a gourd made of sand?!
That technique is...!
Sand Coffin!
No way!
He got hit by the Hidden Lotus
and is still able to bringforth a technique...!
Sand Coffin!
I just cannot lose in a place like this...
I want to...
my Way of the Ninja...
Oh no!
Die!
Why...?
Why... save him?
He's...
I'm all right!
I'm strong so...
The Chunin Exam...
Guy Sensei, please watchme with a smile...
I'd like to prove that I couldbecome a respectable Ninja
even though I can't use Ninjutsu!
That would be the ultimate for me!
He is...
an important subordinatewhom I care for!
A subordinate...whom I care for...?
Those words are definitelynot understandable to Gaara...
I quit...
He quit...?
The moment Guy jumped in,Lee lost.
The winner...
Gaa-!
- Wha...?- Huh?
- Huh?- Huh?
Wha--?!
That's impossible...
Having opened the fifth gate...
And his hand and feet are crushed...
There's no way he shouldbe able to stand...!
Lee...
It's all right.
It's over!
You're in no condition to stand...!
Lee...
Y-You...
You are...
Even after havinglost consciousness...
You still want to prove yourown Way of the Ninja...?
So he had already...
lost consciousness...
Lee...
You're already...
a respectable Ninja...!
The winner...
Gaara.
Lee!
Stop!
Even if you went downwhat could you do?
Your words of encouragementwould only make him feel worse.
There's no way he couldhave beaten Gaara...
He was faced with a tougher battlethan we thought...
That Naruto...
Bushy Brow lostto a guy like this...!
Medics, please hurry.
Bushy Brow...
Lee...
You are the Jonin in charge of him,aren't you?
Y-Yes.
Please come with mefor a minute.
Careful...
Don't shake him.
There is faint breathing...
but because of comminuted fracturesand muscle tears to his entire body,
recovery will likely to takequite some time...
If that was all, it wouldn't be so bad, but...
The damage to the left armand leg which received the attack is severe...
It's too severe...
Oh...!
I don't want to say this,
but he won't be able to...live as a Shinobi again.
T-That...
that can't be true...
I will take Bushy Brow down.Believe it!
It is not you whom I want to fight,it's Uchiha!
You...!
Naruto, I get where you'recoming from, believe me.
But all fighting must be doneofficially in a match!
The failure beats the gifted geniusthrough sheer effort...
Wouldn't that make foran exciting main battle?
Though, I am probably goingto be the one fighting Neji...
Lee...
I didn't want to think... that you'd lose.
I wanted to let you fulfill...
your Way of the Ninja!
Yay!
I finally mastered it!
Yahoo!
This technique...
after all, only Lee managed to master...
Okay, you became Geninfrom today.
I want to hear what it isyou all are aiming for!
I-I'd like to prove that I can becomea respectable Ninja
even though I can't useinjutsu or Genjutsu!
That would be the ultimate for me!
Please forgive me for not...
stopping it...!
Lee...
It's not true... it's not true.
After hearing that,what should Bushy Brow do...?!
This guy...
He said the failure would takedown a genius with effort...!
Isn't there something thatcan be done?!
Calm down, Naruto.
B-But...Kakashi Sensei!
He kept saying he wantedto battle Sasuke and Neji!
Perhaps...that led to his ruin.
To fulfill that dream...
the boy even used a self-sacrificingforbidden technique to try to win!
The result is what you see...
That boy...
Sasuke and Neji...
and you...
he sacrificed himself toa promise he never spoke of.
He risked his life...
so that he might havea chance to battle you guys...
Don't forget that...
I wonder if Lee...
will be all right...?
Lee...
You didn't realize it even at the end...
Heaven does not allow it.
One who tries to move aheadwhile achieving victory
through a method like dyingupon each other's swords.
So it ended without incident...
Welcome back Gaara.
Guy...
Well...
I spoke self-importantly earlier but...
I've thought about it andhad I been in your position...
I probably...wouldn't havebeen able to stop him.
Guy.
We're in the way of thenext tournament... let's go up.
All right...
Then, the tenth and final round is next,both contestants come forward!
So it's finally my turn...
I'm gonna win and havesome barbecued beef!
In any case, I need to last untilthe main tournament and battle Sasuke.
Or I will not have met your expectations,Lord Orochimaru...
I can almost see through it...
The reason that you went to the troubleof getting to Sasuke before us and...
putting a Curse Mark on himwithout killing him...
In other words,
we were the guinea pigs to measureSasuke's abilities during the examinations.
What you wanted isn't Sasuke's life,but Sasuke himself...
I was also taken for a fool...
Now, let the tenth round begin.
Hey, can you hear it?
The clear, blue sky goes on and on
The ocean spans limitlessly
Please keep that smile on your face forever
Or else I'll cry
You won't have to search around you
It's all ok now.
Everyone is insidethis hand
when you want to cry,and you want to run away
When you forget what happiness is
Just sing.
Light is born, and darkness was born
The two are one
Harmonia, feel the telepathy
Hey, can you hear it?
Sakura!
Do you know whereKakashi Sensei is?
Naruto...
I'm gonna have him watchmy training until the main tournament.
Kakashi Sensei is probably with Sasuke.
What's up with you, Sakura?You seem a little down.
No, nothing...
It's just that I get this bad feeling...
Next episode: "A Shadow in Darkness:Danger Approaches Sasuke"
I feel uneasy for some reason...
C'mon!
Running like a fugitive,
Being chased by something
Inside my heart is pounding
My throat dry like it's withering
For no single one,
To none does belong,
This time is ours, right now...
Unraveling the pain,
Unraveling our hearts,
Unraveling shadows
Stifling our breath,
Reaching for beyond,
Tearing through the dark
In fighting and in love
To the distant light above,
Yes, we are on the way
I wanna rock...
Rockin' my heart
I think we almost finishedshaking off the losers.
Then I guess I'll moveonto the main issue.
It has been 45 minutes, so I'll start.
All right!
Here is the tenth question!
Here it comes!
I have to put everything onthe line for this question!
The Tenth Question: All or Nothing!
Hmph! Making such a big deal.
This is the final obstacle.
Kankuro, come back already!
If he starts the tenth question,your cheat sheet has no meaning!
But before that,
I'm going to addsome rules for the last question.
Aren't you lucky?
It looks like playing withthe dolls wasn't a waste, after all?
This guy.
He's figured Crow out!
Anyway, sit down.
Let me explain!
These are
the hopeless rules!
Well, anyhow.
There's nothing to do whenthe subordinates are gone, huh?
Well, it'll get busy soon enough.
Why?
This year's first proctor...
I hear it's that lbiki Morino.
Well then, passing the first examalready seems iffy.
Of all the people, that sadist...
Sadist?
Kurenai, you're a new Jonin,so you wouldn't know.
Who is this person?
He is a pro, a professional.
Professional? Of what?
Torture and interrogation.
What?!
Well, there maybe no physical torturein the exam itself,
but he's sure to use hishis skills as an interrogator
to torment them psychologically.
That is...
Leaf Village Anbu'sTorture and lnterrogation Unit Marshall,
Ibiki Morino!
Hopeless rules...?!
First, you guys will have to choose
whether or not you will takethis 1 0th question!
Huh?!
Choose whether or notto take the exam?
What, choose?!
What happens if you choose notto take the 10th exam?
If you chose not to take the exam,then your score will be zero.
In other words, you fail!
And of course, the same goes forthe two others in the same group!
W-What does that mean!
Of course, everybody is going tochoose to take the exam!
This is ridiculous!As if we have a choice!
And...one more rule...
Another one?!
Finish with it already!
If you chose to take it andare unable to answer it correctly,
then you will have to...
relinquish your rightof taking the Chunin Exam forever.
What kind of ridiculous rule is that?!
Besides, there are plentyof people here
who have taken theChunin Exam many times!
You're just unlucky.
I make the rule this year.
But I did give youthe option to go back!
For those of you who aren't confident,you can choose not to take it
and take the examnext year or the year after that.
Oh! How terrible!
If one out of the threechooses not to take the exam,
then all three will be failed.
If you do choose to take it,but get the wrong answer...
then that person will be aGenin for the rest of their life!
No matter what,the odds are against us!
It's an impossible choicefor anyone with normal nerves!
Then, let's begin...
The 1 0th question...
Those who will not be taking it,raise your hands!
Once I confirm your number,I'll ask you to leave!
What kind of a questionis it going to be....?
Darn!
If I get it wrong,I'll be a Genin for the rest of my life.
I don't want that!
But if I choose not take it...!
then I'll fail Sasuke and Sakura, too!I don't want that either!
I won't raise my hand!
I'm confident thatI can answer it correctly.
But...
But Naruto! You're different!
You should retreat this timeeven if it means to ignore us
and think of your next chanceto take the Exam!
I... I...
I'm quitting!I'm not going to take it!
#50 failed!
#1 30, #1 1 1 will befailed as well...
I-I'm sorry...Gennai! Inaho!
Darn...
M-Me too!
Me too!
Naruto...
Why don't you raise your hand?
That guy...
I am the super elite ninja
who will be carryingthe name of the Hokage!
My name is Naruto Uzumaki,remember that!
Shut up!
I'm prepared to do anythingto become a Hokage!
I will surpass the Hokage!
And I will make all ofthe people in the village
acknowledge my presence!
He's always got such a one-track mind.
Saying Hokage, Hokageall the time like a fool.
I'm sorry, Naruto.
It seems like...
I don't want to...
crush your unachievable dreams.
That guy...
Ibiki completely understands howthe human psyche works.
And the most horrifying part is...
that by cornering people psychologicallyhe controls their psyche and
reveals the fundamentalweakness of a human.
Don't underestimate me!I won't run!
I'll take it!
But even if I'm stuck beinga Genin forever,
I will become a Hokageno matter what it takes!
I'm not scared!
That guy, he wasn't eventhinking of us at all.
Such audacity!
That's right...
That's exactly the kind of fool you are!
I'll ask again.
It's a choice that will alter your life.
If you want to quit, now is your chance!
I'm not going to take backmy words!
That is my Way of Ninja!
Huh... What a funny kid.
He completely brushed awaythose kids' anxieties.
78, huh? Much more leftthan I expected.
It's going to be the same.o matter how much more I push it.
I like your determination!
Then...
For those who are still here...
The first exam...
You have passed it!
Huh?
H-Hey, what does that mean?
All of a sudden you're telling usthat we've passed!
What about the 1 0th question?
There wasn't sucha thing to begin with!
Well, you can look at the choice youjust had to make as the 10th question!
What?!
Hey!
Then, what were allthose nine questions for!
It was just a waste of time!
Not a waste...
The objective of the nine questionswere already accomplished.
To test your individual abilityto gather information!
Ability to gather information?
First...
The focus of this test was
on the system of determiningthe pass or failure
based on the three-person groupsthat was proposed in the first rule.
By grading the exam ona group basis,
I added the unimaginable pressureof dragging down your teammates.
I see, I see.
I kind of felt that wasthe point of this test!
No, you didn't!
However...
The questions on these tests weren'tthings that
you Genin Ninja wouldhave been able to solve...
So in that case...
I imagined that most of you herewould have come to this conclusion:
"ln order to score points,I'll have to cheat."
In other words,
this exam was created under the premisethat you all would cheat!
That being said,
I had two Chunin in the groupwho knew all of the answers
from whom you could cheat.
What?! That's what it was?
I had a hard time figuringout the guy.
Yeah. Really...
It was so obvious!
There's something wrong with youif you didn't notice!
Right, Hinata?!
He... didn't realize it...
However...
those who just foolishly cheated,naturally were disqualified.
That's because...
Information, depending onthe time and situation,
it will be more valuable than life.
And in a mission or on a battlefield,
you will always have to risk your lifeto fight for it!
Horrible burn marks, nail puncturesand scratches...
Those are signs of physical torture!
When information is gathered
and the enemy or a third partyfinds out about it,
that information is no longerguaranteed to be correct.
Just remember this.
To be given the wrong information
can bring a catastrophic blowto your friends and town.
So that is why, out of necessity,we forced you guys to cheat
in order to test your abilityto collect information.
And we filtered out those whowere clearly lacking in those abilities.
But...
The last question doesn'tmake any sense.
However...
this 10th question wasthe main issue of this first exam.
Huh?
What do you mean?
I'll explain.
The tenth question was totake on the question, or not.
Needless to say, it isa painful decision to make.
Those who chose not totake on the question,
would be immediately failedalong with their whole squad!
Those who chose to answerthe question and got it wrong...
would be robbed of their chanceto take the Exam forever.
It really is an unfair question.
Then, how about these two choices?
Let's say that you guys didbecome a Chunin.
The mission is to steala secret document!
You have no idea how manyinjas the enemy has,
their ability, and other armamentthey may have.
On top of that, there maybethe pitfall of an enemy trap.
Now this mission...Will you take it? Or not take it?
Because you want your life spared...
Because your partners willbe put in danger...
Can you get away fromdangerous missions?
The answer is...
No!
There are going to be missionsyou cannot avoid
no matter how risky ordangerous it may be!
Showing your courage toyour teammates in a tight spot,
and the ability to get throughthe hardships...
This is the quality that is neededin a Chunin troop leader!
In a pinch, there arethose who cannot risk their own fate,
and those who waver and give uptheir chances
because they think theywill have another chance.
I believe that such fools who don't havestrong determination
have no right to become a Chunin!
For those of you who choseto take on the question,
you can say that you have successfullyanswered the difficult 10th question!
You shall be able to take onthe adversity that may lie in your way.
You've passed through the gates!
The fist exam for the Chunin Examhas been completed.
I wish you well!
All right! Wish us well!
I did it! I did it!Yeaah!
What a funny guy...
W-What's going on?!
Gosh, this one...
You guys!
This isn't the time to becelebrating!
I'm the proctor for the second exam!Anko Mitarashi!
Let's move ontothe next stage! Next!
Follow me!
Read the atmosphere.
This proctor...Is kind of like Naruto.
78?! Ibiki!You let 26 teams slide by?
I guess, the first exam this time aroundwas too easy.
It seems like this time,there are a lot of excellent candidates.
Huh! Well, all right...
I'll drop more than half of themin the second exam!
M-More than half?
I'm getting excited.
I'll give you the details tomorrow.
We'll be changing locations,
so get information from your Joninabout the location and the time!
That's it. You're dismissed.
I didn't think that there would be a guythat would pass with a blank sheet.
Naruto Uzumaki...He really is a funny guy.
W-What is this place?!
NO TRESPASSING
This is the location forthe "second exam",
the 44th T raining Field.
Also known as...the Forest of Death.
The Forest of...Death?!
I passed the first exam!
I'm just going to hop, jumpand take a big step and...
Huh? Konohamaru and the gang?
Hey, you guys!
if you want to play a Ninja game...
No? What?You came here for a mission?!
Next episode:"Special Report:Live from the Forest of Death!"
As for me, I'm going to kick-butt again!Press down hard on the gas
That's right, there's no compromise
We'll slip through the night
At the final moment push hard
That's right, all the way to zero,
Until we wipe away the days
Gently open your heart
If you pull it close to you
It will reach you, without a doubt
It will come, closer
Now
We're speeding through life,squeezing it for all of its worth
Our feet are tied
But we still keep going farther
Even if I take it back, and grasp it
If you're not the one
There will be no meaning
And so we'll go far off into the distance.

I won't lose here!
Whatever! You can't keep upwith my speed at all!
U-!
Zu-! Ma-! Ki-!
Naruto Barrage!
The winner is Naruto Uzumaki.
I'm...getting stronger!
Ohhhh!
Cha!
Nice one! You did it!
T-That Naruto beat Kiba!
It's a major upset...
Yup!
Yes!
Byakugan Battle: Hinata Grows Bold!
This medicine works really well!
Here! Do you want touse it too, Sakura?
Only your wounds healwith such speed...Naruto.
The power of Nine Tail nevercease to amaze me.
U-Umm...
T-This is...
ointment for your wound,
for you Kiba and Akamaru.
Rather than worrying about others,
it's about time you worriedabout yourself!
Kiba...
There are only 6 people left...
you, Choji, Neji, Lee, one Sound guy,and the Sand guy.
Listen, Hinata...
If you pull that guy from Sand,withdraw quickly.
And there's one more...
Do the same if you get Neji, too.
Withdraw quickly...
That guy will be hard on you.
He will destroy you.
Well, let's announce the next match.
- Huh?- Huh?
- What?- Huh?
Hinata Hyuga vs. Neji Hyuga
Hinata...
This is going to be an interesting match...
I never thought that I wouldhave a fight with you...
Lady Hinata.
Brother Neji...
Brother?
Huh?!
Those two are siblings?
They're descended from
one of the most honorableold families in the Hidden Leaf...
The Hyuga Clan.
But, they're not siblings.
Then, how are they related?
Well, the relation of a head familyand branch family...
That may be an appropriateway to say it.
Head family and branch family?
Yes!
Hinata is from the head family.
In other words, a person fromthe main household
and Neji is from a branch familythat is descended from that family.
In other words,it's a fight between relatives.
It must be uneasy for both of them...
Yes.
However...
Huh? What is it?
I've heard that from long ago,
there've been various incidents betweenthe head family and branch family,
and now their relationshipisn't on very good terms.
Hmmm.
Why?
I don't know the details either.
Only...
The so-called distinguished Ninja clanslike Uchiha and Hyuga
have special techniques andabilities that run in the family.
It seems that the Hyuga householdlaid down rules
for communicating those techniques...
It seems that there are many rulesthat favor the head family...
- Huh?- Huh?
And there have beenvarious incidents
between the head family andbranch family due to those rules.
So this is a confrontation billedas a clash of fate...
Oh, it's gonna begin.
Start the battle please!
Just one thing before we square offagainst each other in the fight...
I should advise you, Lady Hinata.
Withdraw!
You're not suited to being a Shinobi.
You're too nice.
You wish for harmony andavoid conflict,
you're open to going withthe thinking of others.
And, you have no confidencein yourself.
You're always feeling inferior...
You thought it's a good ideato stay Genin.
However, you can't register forthe Chunin test without three members...
So you couldn't turn down when Kibaand the other proposed it and,
the truth is, you enteredthe exam reluctantly.
Is that wrong?!
T-That's wrong...
That's not true...
I...
I only...
I wanted to change that about myself...
So I proposed it myself...
Hinata...
Stand up, Hanabi!
From now on, I'll keep Hinataunder my wing...
But is that really okay?
Hinata should be the heir tothe Hyuga clan...
But, there is always death involvedwith the job of Genin.
Do what you want.
She's a failure who's inferior even to heryounger sister Hanabi, five years her junior.
We don't need her herein Hyuga clan...
Is that all you have to say?
If so, leave!
You're in the way!
Yes.
Hinata is trying to changeherself in her own way.
Lady Hinata...
You are a spoiled one ofthe head family.
People can never change!
A failure will always be a failure...
That personality and strengthwon't change.
That guy...
Since people don't change,differences exist among them...
and expressions like "elite"and "failure" are born.
Everyone judges and are judged
based on the value of their face andbrain, ability and body type,
good and bad points oftheir personalities.
People have to suffer and live
within the means of theelements they cannot change.
Just like the fact that I'm from abranch family
and you're from the head family,
these things can't change.
I've seen everything withthis Byakugan.
That's why I understand!
You're just talking tough.
You're really thinking that you'dlike to run away from this place...
T-That's wrong...
I really...
Byakugan?
It's said that if you tracethe Uchiha Clan's history,
the clan's ability has its sourcein Hyuga clan.
The Byakugan is one of theHyuga clan's Kekkei Genkai,
a Visual Jutsu similarto Sharingan...
However, with the ability of insight alone...
it gets the better of Sharingan.
Byakugan!
Hinata Hyuga vs. Neji Hyuga
My eyes can't be deceived.
Just now from my pressure,
your line of sight was pushedto the upper left.
This is the sign that you're recallingyour past experience...
your bitter past.
And soon after that, your line of sightmoved to the bottom right...
This is the sign that you're imaginingphysical and mental suffering.
That means...
you're picturing your old self,
and from all of your experiencesup until now,
you're imagining the resultof this battle...
The image of you losing!
Even the act of propping your armsin front of your body...
It's a gesture that means
you want to build a wallbetween us and keep distant.
And that reflects your mind...
that you don't want any moreof your deepest feelings to be raided...
Because everything I've saidis right on the mark, right?
Furthermore...
Laying a finger on your lips,
that too, is a self-familiarizing actwhich represents a sense of panic.
It represents a defense instinct--
you want to alleviate the tensionand unease.
In other words...
deep in your heart,you know it's true, don't you?
Changing yourself,is something you absolutely can't--!
Sure, she can!
You don't have the privilege ofdeciding what a person is like, stupid!
Give it to him, Hinata!
Naruto...
Hinata!
Don't just take it!Argue back!
I'm getting irritated watching this!
Naruto...
What an annoying guy!
Naruto...
Thank you!
The expression of her eyeshas changed...
So you're not going to withdraw?
I 'm not taking responsibilityfor what happens!
I...
I won't run away!
I don't...
I don't change my words...
That's my Way of Ninja!
... want to run anymore!
Byakugan!
Brother Neji!
I challenge you!
T-That is...
Fine...
Of course, the same Hyuga style...
Her pose is very similarto Neji's.
Hyuga style?
The strongest Taijutsu stylein the Village Hidden in the Leaf...
Huh?
I said it before...
The man who is most likely
the strongest Genin of HiddenLeaf Village is on my team...
That's...
That guy, Neji Hyuga.
Here!
Did it go in?!
No...it was shallow!
No. Even a graze works.
That's the reason that the Hyuga clan
is called the Hidden Leaf'sdistinguished family.
Huh? What do you mean?
The Hyuga has a particularTaijutsu passed down through generations.
It's not like the kind of Taijutsu thatLee and I are good at...
Our way of fighting, Furious Fist,
is mainly to inflict external damageon our enemy,
like broken bones and surface wounds.
In contrast, the Hyuga's Taijutsuinflict damage
on the Chakra Network throughwhich Chakra flow through the body,
and damaging the insides,namely, it destroys internal organs.
They possess the Gentle Fist.
It's not spectacular to watch...
but later it slowly takes effect.
Well, you can't train the internal organs...
Even if you were really robust,
one hit from it would bea deadly blow...
Even I can...
Hinata 's on the offensive...
Hinata...
Way to go, Hinata!
To attack the Chakra Network...
What are they, those people...?
Hey!
Hey!
Chakra Network, what's that?!
Here we go again...
a question from a stupid guy.
I'll explain.
They're like blood canals.
In the same way that blood flowsthrough vessels throughout the body,
They're bundles of canals that takeChakra's into every corner of your body...
Oh!
Like a path for Chakras, huh?
Yes...
Furthermore, the Chakra Networkis closely connected
with the internal organs whichenfold Chakra within the body.
That's why ifthe Chakra Network is attacked
the internal organs also suffer damage.
Huh, you know a lot, don't 'ya?
Hey you!That's no way to talk to your senior!
It's no wonder...
Lee's greatest long-standing enemy.
That's...
him.
Sensei...
But, how can they do that?
After all, the Chakra Networkisn't visible to the eyes.
How do they attack the Chakraline inside the body?
No.
The eyes of those two...
They can see it withtheir Byakugan.
And a Gentle Fist attack is a littledifferent from a regular attack.
They release their own Chakra
from a Chakra opening in their handand screw it into their opponent's body.
It directly inflicts damage onyour enemy's Chakra Network.
All right!
Has she done it?
Hey, can you hear it?
The clear, blue sky goes on and on
The ocean spans limitlessly
Please keep that smile on your face forever
Or else I'll cry
You won't have to search around you
It's all ok now.
Everyone is insidethis hand
when you want to cry,and you want to run away
When you forget what happiness is
Just sing.
Light is born, and darkness was born
The two are one
Harmonia, feel the telepathy
Hey, can you hear it?
Amazing!
That Hinata!
She's always melancholyand wishy-washy and...
I thought she is kinda weird, yet...
Even when she gets blow after blow,she gets back up and goes.
There's something abouther way of fighting.
Just a feeling,but she resembles you, I think.
Resembles me?Hinata resembles me?
Now that I think about it, that girl,she was always watching you.
Huh?

- Good-bye, Sensei.- Yay! School's out!
Good-bye, Iruka Sensei!
Good-bye!
Make sure you practice whatI taught you today, Transform Jutsu!
And tell your family about tomorrow'sinauguration for the Fifth Hokage!
- Okay!- Okay.
Konohamaru!
What is it, Iruka Sensei?
Well... it's all right.
See you tomorrow!
Okay... Goodbye, Iruka Sensei!
It looks like he got over it.
Hey, Lee!
On your way back from rehabilitation?
Um... yes...
I hope you get better soon.
Thank you very much.
To activate each andevery cell all at once...
If it were just one by one,it'd be a snap,
but all of them togetheris gonna be tough.
Still...
The Leaf Village isin great trouble right now,
so we must do our best!
I think if you had Lady Tsunade takea look, you'd get better very quickly.
It's better that you give up beinga Shinobi and look for a different path.
Sensei and Student:The Bond of the Shinobi
Clone Jutsu!
Transformation Jutsu!
Hey, young kid...
The medal of youth is one of passion,with no looking back!
If you work hard at it,
I'm telling you, son,you will become a fine Shinobi! Yay!
Who is he?He is pretty overbearing.
Son, be ambitious! Bloom of Youth...
Well then, adieu.
That was the first time I met Guy Sensei.
And then...
Today, you have all become Genin.
I want to hear whatyour goals are for the future.
I don't want to answer.
I-l...!
I'd like to prove thatI could become a splendid Ninja,
even though I can't useinjutsu or Genjutsu!
That would be the ultimate for me!
Those are good serious eyes...
You! What's so funny?!
I'm serious!
I will become a respectable Ninjaeven only with Taijutsu!
Don't you realize thatif you can't use Ninjutsu or Genjutsu,
you're not a Ninja in the first place?
Don't you remember being toldthat you're the first person
to graduate from the academywho's only able to use Taijutsu?
It's not because you're so good;it's just that you're unusual.
W-Why--!
Listen up! If you have passion,it's not necessarily so.
If you act with passion,
compete with good rivalsand lift each other up,
you can all become great Ninja!
But you know,you have to work hard!
Passion...
I...was inspired by Guy Sensei.
By his words...and his deeds.
You're late!1 7 minutes and 32 seconds late!
Let's not do it today, all right?
Each of us has 48 wins!
With a win today,one of us will pull ahead!
I guess you won't give upeven if I say I wouldn't want to do it.
It's my turn to choose the event, right?
Right! What's it gonna be?
A Taijutsu battle? A 1 00-meter dash?
Holding our breath under water?
I don't care, we could evenhave an eating contest...
Please...
Okay, then...
Wh-What?!
Rock, paper, scissors!
Rock, paper, scissors?That's what you choose?
They say that your luck isone part of your skill, don't they?
Plus, it's a great competitionfor testing your observational reflexes...
R-Right.
Do you get the feelingKakashi's just playing around with Guy
'cuz he can't be bothered?
That's what it looks like to me.
I accept the battle.There's no way I'm gonna lose!
If I do, I'll walk around the Leaf Village500 times on my hands!
There you go again...
I promise!
Here we go...
Another one of your special,self-imposed rules.
He can't do that.
That's ridiculous.He's acting like a kid.
Yeah, that's impossible,even for Guy Sensei.
Impossible? Reckless, I'd say!
- Rock, paper...!- Rock, paper...!
Here you are.
Guy Sensei?
How did you know I was here?
I know everything about you.
I heard that you skipped outon rehabilitation these past two days?
You can't be doing that!
When I first became Genin...
this is where I revealedmy dream, my aspiration.
Neji laughed at me then,but I meant what I said.
I'd like to prove thatI could become a splendid Ninja
even though I can't useinjutsu or Genjutsu!
That would be the ultimate for me!
At that time, you told me...
If you act with passion,compete with rivals,
you can become a fine Ninja.
And that...
In order to do that, it'd take "effort."
I was happy to hear that.
- Transform!- Transform!
Because while at the academy...
no one, not one friend or teacher,said that kind of thing to me.
You put me at ease...
You opened up a pathjust when I was unsure of myself.
I realized all I had to dowas try my best.
And when I complained that
all my efforts couldn't matchthe others' natural talents,
you told me that I hada natural talent for effort.
That was when I learned the importanceof believing in my own strength.
The chance of a successful surgeryis probably 50%, at best.
But... this is one time...even if I try my best...!
and even if I believe in myself,there's nothing in the world I can do!
Guy Sensei... Please tell me...!
Please tell me.Can I become like you?
Why did this kind of thinghappen only to me?
Because I have my ownWay of Ninja to follow,
my own dreams and aspirationsthat I have to protect and
prove to the world evenif it means dying for...
What should I do?!
The Eight Inner Gates...
Is this the Forbidden Jutsu thatwill destroy the body of the practitioner?
Please tell me!
I'm prepared for the worst.
Please teach me that Forbidden Jutsu!
Everything is...for my dream!
That means everything to me!
You tried to become a great Ninjarelying only on Taijutsu...
Until now, that's all you had.
It must be so painful for you...
Now that it seems that your dreams
and all your wishesare being cruelly taken away.
It does not matter what his wishes are,he should give up on becoming a Shinobi.
Lee...
If you want to be free of that pain,you have to prepare yourself!
Does it mean...to prepare to give up my dreams?
If you lose your dreams,
you will undergo pain even greaterthan what you feel now.
Neither you nor I would be able togo on living if we lose the Way of Ninja.
What fools we are...
Lee! Have the surgery!
How's it going with Cell Activation Jutsu?
It's all about the Chakra, but...
There are so many kinds of cells...
skin cells, internal organ cells,muscular cells...
You know, it's just a tad difficultto activate all of them at once.
What's that?"Just a tad," you say?
Are you testing me?
Oh no!
I'm declaring my trust in you.
I don't know why,but just a while ago...
I was remembering the timewhen you and Kakashi Sensei
were competingwith rock, paper, scissors.
At that time, Kakashi Sensei said
that your luck isone part of your skill, right?
This surgery is also fifty-fifty,live or die...
But...
it's not a game ofrock, paper, scissors!
Do you remember what happenedafter that, Lee?
500 times around...It's a promise! Yay!
What's he doing?!
Shoot!
If I lose, I'll walk 500 timesaround the Leaf Village, on my hands!
It's a promise!
He can't do that! That's stupid.He's acting like a kid.
Hah! This is nothing!
Wh-What are you doing here, Lee?
Why are you doing this?
Kakashi Sensei is not here.In fact, no one is watching.
When a man stands cool witha Nice-guy pose in front of others,
he should keep his promise,even if it kills him!
It's a promise!
What?
Why do you always do that?
Whenever you're about to startdoing something,
why do you always come upwith some kind of crazy rule.
Good question, Lee.
You really know howto get to the point.
OK, I'll tell you.But remember, you can't tell anyone else.
What's the answer?
Making self-rules is nothing less thana practice which brings me victory!
S-Self-rules...?
Are you ready?
The point of these rules is that,when you're going after something,
they push you into a real tough spot...
It's about chaining yourself down.
For example, on the other sideof the hellish rule that
"If I lose at rock, scissors, paper,I'll do 500 laps" is the idea that
"If I do 500 laps,
there's no way I won't be ableto beat Kakashi next time."
They hold power,the potential of the heavens.
Y-Yes...
By being chained downto doing 500 laps,
it makes you get serious.
Even about things likerock, paper, scissors competitions,
which are so trifling otherwise.
And, even if you lose,walking around the village 500 times
give you the benefitof extremely intense training.
I see!
OK, I've gotta do a little more.Here we go!
I'm going with you!I have my own "self-rule" which is--
Hey! Hey! Don't push yourself, Lee.
If I can't keep up with you, I'll...
try even harder!
That is, I'll aim to be like you.
And if I keep trying,I'll be able to become a great Ninja!
All right! If that's the case,then I have an addition to my rule!
If you can't keep up with meall the way to the end...
I'll put every ounce ofmy being into training you!
If I train you with all my being,you'll be able to turn into a fine Ninja!
I promise!
Huh, that's right.
That was the first time you told me aboutthe "self-rule," wasn't it?
Your surgery will be a success
because you have worked hardall the way through.
You have the power to bringyour own future in the heavens.
And in the one in a thousand...
no, one in a million chancethat something goes wrong...
I will die with you!
Ever since I met you,
my Way of Ninja has been tonurture you into a fine Ninja.
I promise you!
Neither you nor I would be ableto go on living if we lose the Way of Ninja.
What fools we are...
G-Guy Sensei!
OK, let's go, Lee!
Yes, sir!
Lady Tsunade!
From this day forward,
I am the ruler of the Village Hiddenin the Leaves, the Fifth Hokage!
I believe your promise,its a true heart give me courage
Always I feel itthe precious time with you
On your still shoulder
I feel the wind that blowstowards tomorrow
The city lights are like pieces of stars
That hold us together
"Each one of us glows differently, "
you say laughingly
but you look most dazzling
Like a comet,
like the rainbow after the storm
You bring light into my heart
Being lost can be the answer
Let's promise we won't cheat
Uh...like a shooting star,we do go ahead.
Darn! He has no holein his defense.
Being impatient won'tdo any good, Naruto.
Let's utilize the next mission.
That's right. The next missionrequires an overnight stay.
- Our chance will be at the inn.- Roger that!
Once we get to the inn,we'll wait until he's defenseless...
- and then...- and then...
- unmask him at once!- unmask him at once!
Next time: "Gotta See! Gotta Know!Kakashi Sensei's True Face!"
'Cuz we're really curious!Yeah, turn your sadness into kindness, your uniqueness into strength
Even if you get lost, let's start walking
One more time
Are you really happy
when you're always meeting to someone's expectations?
Even if you change to who you really wanna be
Will you always have a great smile?
Dreaming of only "the beginning," I wake up
and someday, I'll live on my own.
Yes, precious things are never in shape
You never know what it is when you get it or lose it
Yeah, turn your sadness into kindness, your uniqueness into strength
Even if you get lost, let's start walking
One more time

Tomorrow, huh...
The Final Rounds:Rush to the Battle Arena!
What's up? It's been a while.
Heh-heh...I was kind of in the hospital.
The hospital?
I'm totally fine, now.
Nothing to it!
I see.
Ayame!
Yes!
Here you go.
Pops?
Just eat it.
The final round is tomorrow, right?
Okay, then.
Thanks!
You've got a daughter at home,so it's not so bad, right?
Most of my money vanisheswith the food expenses.
Moron. Your home is special, right?
Huh?
Girls are a drag.
Yeah. There are times when I reallydon't get how to act with her.
Father's have it rough...
Hah, am I the only bad guy?
Hey, master.
Let me have everythingon these two pages, too!
Welcome!
Oh! Strong reinforcements!
Come on. You order something, too!
Hey... Dad.
Hmm?
Hey! Let's go home, already!
Excuse me?
Shut up. You're supposed tolive it up at a festival!
Festival, my butt...
What a drag.
You idiot... Since olden times...
the final round'sbeen like a festival!
I'm in that final round tomorrow.
Jeez, don't make come to get you.
You're... in it?
Please, Dad...
Tomorrow, eh...
Yeah.
Tomorrow...is a full moon...
To think you didn't evenget a scratch...
Perfect, eh, Neji?
That's enough warm-up exercise...
Shall we get going?
I was nervous and couldn't sleep.
First...it's him...in the first match.
Quite honestly...even my Sharingancan't see through his Tenketsu!
The strongest man in theLeaf is on my team.
It is that...Neji Hyuga!
Neji...Neji...Neji...
At last...
The first match is Neji Hyuga, right?!
Yeah. He's the number one rookiefrom last year, right?!
We can't miss the first match!
Neji...Hyuga...
Now I can summon a frog...It'll be okay.
They all...look nasty.
Hinata!
Yipes! N-N-Naruto.
W-What are you doing here?
Today is the final round, isn't it?
I... Just something...
I came to check out this training field.
This is the place whereI became Genin, so...
Really? W-Why?
N-Nothing...That doesn't matter!
Y-You're right. I'm sorry.
Say, Hinata...
Neji's a relative of yours, right?
Y-Yes.
Is he really strong...?
Yes...
I see.
B-But you might be able to win, Naruto.
Yeah. I'm strong, after all!
I bet you can win, Naruto.
What?
You know...
I...when you cheered for me,
I felt like I was able to becomestronger than before.
Hinata! Hang tough!
When the preliminaries ended,
I became able to likemyself just a little.
I'll...
stand...
by my own...
words.
That is my way of Ninja.
From someone else's standpoint,it might not look like anything's changed...
but I feel like I was able to change.
I've been thinking that it was...thanks to you, Naruto.
Say, Hinata...
Did you really think so?
What?
I may look strong to you,
but all I do is mess up...
And I act tough becauseI'm frustrated.
It's not like that!
Even when you messed up,
in my view... you were alwaysa proud failure.
W-When I look at you,it impacts my heart.
You're not perfect, so...
So...
It's because you mess up...
that you have the strengthto rise up from that.
I think such strength istrue strength.
I... I think you're anincredibly strong person.
Thanks, Hinata!
Even though I was alwaysthe bottom one...
I was tense in the shoulders, somehow!
I was depressed,which was totally not my character.
But I feel better now!
Naruto...
Okay! I'm off to the match!
Hinata...
Huh?
I kind of... thought you were...
W-What...?
... gloomy, hesitant and weird.
Naruto...
But I quite like...people...
like you!
...like you!
Oh, yeah! Be sure to come watch mekick that Neji's butt!
Uh-oh. Time to run!
I-I'm late, late!
See you later, Hinata!
Sorry I'm late, Hinata.
Well, Shino's match isn't untilquite a bit later, so...
Hm? Hey? Hinata?
Hmm? W-What?
Oh, it's starting!
Move, move!
C'mon, move!
Dang it! There's quite a distance!
I won't make it!
Brother Naruto!
Konohamaru?!
I've come to aid in brother's crisis, here!
Konohamaru...What're you doing here?!
I'll tell you later!
This way, here!
There's an ace shortcut whereyou can get straight to the arena, here!
What?!
All right!Well done, Konohamaru!
Those who control thesecret path control time.
Oh, I see!You're awesome, Konohamaru!
As I recall, there's a holein the wall around here...
Oh!
Here it is!
Oh!
What's the matter, Konohamaru?
The secret path has been repaired, here!
Whaat...?
Oh! There's no time!
Brother!
Next approach!
Look! I'm really out of time.
It's a secret, but there'san awesome path
that can get you inside the arenain an instant, here!
What?! All right!Well done, Konohamaru!
This hole is a shortcut?
It's a straight shot tothe final round arena!
No doubt, here!
Straight shot, huh?Okay!
Let's hurry!
Yeah!
Konohamaru!What's happening here?!
It's okay, here!
We're almost to the finalround arena, here!
See? There's the exit, here!
Oh, oh.
What?!
Hot-hot-hot-hot-hot-hot!
T-This is...some kind of mistake!
Kooonooohaaamaaaruuu!
What the heck are you doing?!
We've gotten furtherand further away!
Until just recently,
it was connected to thefinal round arena, here.
Next approach, right away...
This is it!
If you ride this, you'll get to thefinal round arena just like that, here!
Huh? A bull?
Think again, brother.
A feudal lord Bull is not at all inthe same league as ordinary cows, here.
Once they start running,even race horses grow deathly pale.
There's no way they can beata no-nonsense feudal lord cow!
Anyway, it's an awesome cow!
Brother, if you leave the rest to this cow,
it's just a short run tothe final round arena, here!
Then, I'm counting on you.
Okay, let's go!
Huh? Wha--?!
Ouch!
What?
Brother, go for it, here!
Hey! Stop! Stop!
Hey-hey, we're missing quitea few people.
What's going on?It's going to start.
What's the meaning of this?Sasuke...?
And even Naruto...
Why is it?!
This is bad!
That's it!
Shadow Clone Jutsu!
Guys! Scatter the rampaging cows!
- Yeah!- Yeah!
What's wrong with you guys?Why are you back, hey?!
More appeared!
The escape path was blocked!
It won't do any good to multiply!
Hmm? What the--?!
Naruto Uzumaki...?
We leave the rest to you!
Whoa, let us in, quick!
Hey!
Entry has already...!
What kind...of entrance isthis kid making...?
Naruto.
He's totally late.
What a drag.
Guys, run! A large herd ofstampeding bulls is coming.
Huh? What are you talking about?
Jeez! I'm serious.So many of them...!
Huh? Hey...Where's Sasuke?
The Dosu guy I'm supposedto fight isn't here, either.
Hey, you guys there.
Don't be restless.
Throw out your chests andshow your faces to the spectators!
You guys are the stars ofthis "final round."
One! First, Tyson jumps and slamdunks
Two! He kisses and hugs everyonerandomly and says "l LOVE YOU"
Three! Masala masters Yogabut hates curry

All over the world, the sky's smiling,so look up and smile too
Oh yeah! Oh yeah! Oh yeah!Fight! Fight! Fight!
Hey Hinata!
Keep your eyes open and watch medefeat this unpleasant guy!
He goes and decides thata person's life path can't be changed...
Destiny is decided when one is born?Don't kid me!
People definitely can change.
By defeating this guy,I'll prove that!

Huh? Uh... Excuse me...
Return of the Morning Mist
My mother and my father...They didn't have to die.
Because I didn't have strength,the whole clan was destroyed.
Everyone was killed...
Darn it...
Morning training is over!
Once I've eaten breakfast
I'll get back to rigorous training!
Old man...
Konohamaru...
Yo! Konohomaru.
Naruto.
Have you already resumed studiesat the academy?
N-No, not yet.
The school buildings are damaged,so we're all repairing them.
Is that so?
How about you, Naruto?You're already training?
Sort of.
Wh-What?
What is it?
N-No, it's nothing...
- Hey um...!- Hey um...!
So what is it...?
You too, Naruto, what is it?
Nothing... really...
I don't feel lonely.
Huh?
There's no time to be feeling lonely.
Everyone is working really hardto rebuild the village right now.
Konohamaru...
Right now, I must work forthe village even just a little bit.
So Naruto, you work hardat your training too.
If you don't,I'll become Hokage before you.
Fool, I will absolutely become Hokage.
Besides... you have to graduatefrom the Academy first.
Oh, that's right...
Oh, here it is.
Here, it's for you.
A free ramen ticket from Ichiraku...
Is it okay?
I already have one,so I'm giving one to you.
Thank you, Naruto.
Oh! Konohamaru.
Good morning.
I'm going to go.
We'll work hard again today.
- Yep!- Yep!
Today we're fixing the blackboards.
I brought paint.
Well! Once I've eaten ramen at Ichiraku,I'll continue training.
This is it.
Th-This is...
A lot of time has passed since the death.
It's probably beforethe Chunin Exam began.
I see, so that's it...
That Orochimaru!
After the murder of Lord Kazekage,
Orochimaru... or someonelike Kabuto played Kazekage...
How thoughtless we were...
That darn Sarutobi...
Well, it's not that easy.
The one who was your opponentwas the renowned Hokage,
deemed to be strongest ofall five great nations.
However... you've done well.Two out of the five Kages...
Stop...
Stop giving me words of sympathy.
I will kill you!
Of course, I didn't mean to...
It's true that we didn't succeedin bringing the village down...
On the other hand, another objectiveof this plan, Sasuke Uchiha...
Your leash is now on him.
In exchange for these armsand all of my Jutsu...
If we could have gotten our handson that Itachi Uchiha from the beginning,
it wouldn't have been a problem.
However that's a dream thatcan no longer come true.
He is stronger than I am.
That is why... I pulled myself outfrom that organization...
Kakashi, huh?
What does he want?
Breakfast, breakfast!
Wait for me, my ramen.
Do you already knowhis whereabouts?
Yes.
In that case, it will be easy...
Let's go.
Here it comes, here it comes.
Oh goodie, it's just like I thought.
Hidden Leaf Village...has a high average score.
You're still doing sucha ridiculous thing?
Well yes, this is my research.
Old Man Homura and Koharu Sensei, huh?
I wonder what you adviserswant from me.
Surely, you know...
without our telling you, don't you?
You don't have to makesuch scary faces.
I heard that the talks with Sand Villagehave been settled without problems.
The Hidden Village in the Sandannounced that
everything was Orochimaru's handiwork.
In addition, at the moment of theircomplete surrender to us, the Leaf Village,
that wasn't a very important issueany more.
Leaf Village has no choice butto accept their surrender and proposition
in order to restore national power.
However, the current strength ofLeaf Village has dropped drastically.
Under these conditions,
our top priority must be to preparefor any unpredicted crisis.
We don't know when any ofthe neighboring nations
will come out in a bold move.
Therefore, we've decided that untilthe village gets its strength back,
we should assemble the top few menfrom each troop,
and form an emergencyexecutive committee to handle this.
But first...
we need a strong, trustworthy leader.
You can find the seeds of troublerolling around everywhere these days.
It's not just Orochimaru.
You didn't have to go throughthe trouble of informing me that.
Well... I'll continue gathering materials.
I'm going to tell you the basic plan.
We need the Fifth Hokage right away.
And yesterday at an emergency meetingwith the feudal lord of the Land of Fire,
we decidedit would be you, Jiraiya.
I'm sorry, it's not my nature.
It has been decided.
Besides, if a Shinobi like you,renowned as a Sannin, is not...
then who is?
If you want a Sannin,there is one more left...
That Tsunade.
Certainly that child probablyhas that capability, but...
However, no one knows where she is.
I'll find and bring her back.If I do that there's no problem, right?
But...
A wise one like Tsunade is meant tobe Hokage more than l, with no motivation.
What do you want to do?
All right.We'll give it urgent consideration.
However, we'll have three membersfrom Anbu Black Ops to accompany you
as the search unit for Tsunade.
Don't worry, I won't escape from this.The guards are not necessary.
However...
There is one guy that I wantto take with me on my trip.
I've found an interesting egg...
What? That is absolutely strange.
Sorry, but if you don't have a ticket,there's no ramen.
No, wait a minute!I absolutely had one more.
Huh?
The one that I gave Konohamaru,was it the last?
Welcome!
Hey, my ramen!
"Racy Violence"
Yo, you two!
You seem to be getting along well.
Fool, Anko asked me tobuy rice dumplings. That's all.
What are you doing here?
While I'm here to buy offerings,I've made plans to meet here...
with Sasuke.
Huh, it's rare that you wait for people.
Is the offering to Obito?
Obito?
Well...that's about right.
Kakashi, it's strange foryou to be here first.
Well... once in a while.
I don't do natto (fermented beans)and sweet things.
Oh... Is that so?
What?!
This is absolutely positively strange!
You guys aren't from the village...Why in the world did you come?
I haven't seen you fora while Asuma, Kurenai.
If you know about us,are you former Leaf Shinobi?
- Huh?!- Huh?!
Y-You are?!
Humph, without a doubt...
Itachi...
Uchiha.
You are acquaintances of Itachi?
If so...
I'll introduce myself as well.
I'm Kisame Hoshigaki.
Hereafter, I hope to be familiar with you.
Never mind later,I'm going to beat you now!
Itachi...
It seems you're pretty unpopularin the village too.
I know you, too.
Kisame Hoshigake,
originally a Shinobiof Hidden Village in the Mist.
Suspected of national covert activitiesand of killing a feudal lord,
a Rogue Ninja from Land of Water,on the wanted list in all nations.
You're a major S-rank criminallisted in the Bingo Book.
Itachi, you have some nervecoming back to this village
after causing that awful incident.
Asuma... Kurenai...
Don't interfere with me.
I don't intend to kill you.
That's not a line for you,who killed your comrades.
I know there's no wayyou'd come here
without any clear purposein those suspicious appearance.
What are you after?
This guy is pretty annoying.Should we kill him?
It doesn't look like we are ableto leave the village so smoothly...
But don't overdo it,your techniques tend to stand out.
They're done for then.
This is...
Genjutsu.
Pressing down with the tip of his sword...What strength.
My large sword, Shark Skin...
doesn't cut, but lops it off!
Kurenai... You're late.
With this...
it's over!
Genjutsu of that level doesn't work on me.
This is... Genjutsu Reversal?
Kurenai!
There's no time to look away.
That's what's expected from you, Kurenai.
But...
"But" this is as far as it goes...
for you.
What?!
Water Style!
- Water Shark Bomb Jutsu!- Water Shark Bomb Jutsu!
The same Jutsu as me?!
Why have you shown up too?
Well... I asked you to take careof them earlier.
But I kinda felt uneasy, you know.
Shadow clones.
Kakashi...
Hatake.
Cripes... So much fuss for nothing.
I...
I put it under my headband
in order not to drop the important ticketduring morning training.
Okay, that's fine...Eat well and do your best.
Hmm?
You're going to do it againafter this, right? Training?
Of course! I'm full of motivation.
Good! Here you go.
Another serving for free! Go for it!
Thank you, sir!
Welcome.
Just like I heard...I had to come and see it.
It seems that you reallyare just eating ramen.
Oh, Pervy Sage!
A cycle of hardship, right?
Inside, we were crying, right?
But the one thing we won't give upis the dream we've chosen, right?
It's a secondary role,
a role in the shadows
But in reaching for that dream,
let us stay centered,let us stay true
Over and over,we hung on without giving up
Over and over,we kept coming back up
Over and over,we believed and dreamed
Over and over,we've seen fools
Over and over,we've stood in the shadows of others
Now, it's our turn...Let us bask in our dreams
Itachi Uchiha...
who became a leader ofAnbu Black Ops at the age of thirteen
and who destroyedthe Uchiha clan single-handedly.
I don't know why he hassuddenly appeared after all this time...
But I don't think we willallow him to leave so easily.
What is your purpose?!

My body movementshave finally returned...
Blood...
Lady Tsunade!
Say! Say! What's happening?!
Why's Kabuto fightingwith Old Lady Tsunade?!
Take a good look at the headband!
He's Orochimaru's subordinate.
Attack! Fury of the Rasengan!
That man is Orochimaru...
Shizune, you take care ofthe guy with the glasses...
I'll take care of Orochimaru.
Before that, I'd like to have Tsunadedo something about this body.
The effects of that drugmight still last for awhile...
There's nothing thatI can do about it.
What? Really?
Geez. I guess it can't be helped.
I have no choicebut to fight in this condition.
Tsunade... Rest your bodywith Recovery Ninjutsu.
Then... What about me, me?
You guard Tsunade togetherwith that pig.
What?! I want to fight, too.Even I can--
No, you won't!
Like that four-eyed kid said, right?
You're on a different level.
The opponent is a Sannin like myself,
and the man who killedthe Third Hokage.
An eye for an eye...I'm the only one who can fight him.
And that four-eyed guy possessesthe same level of power as Kakashi.
Okay.
Then... Shadow Clo--
Hold it!
Don't use the Shadow Clone Jutsu.It'd be utterly pointless.
What?
It wouldn't even becomemuch of a diversion...
It'd be a waste of Chakra...
with them as opponents.
Now then, let's get this thing started.
- Summoning Jutsu.- Summoning Jutsu.
Hi.
- Huh?!- What is this?!
- Wha--?!- What the heck's going on?!
Long time no see.
On account of the drug,
Master Jiraiya still can't build upChakra very well.
It looks like your stupidstill hasn't healed, eh, Jiraiya.
That's too much even for youwith no ability.
It seems Tsunade got youwith something.
A sacrifice was necessary for that Jutsu,
so perhaps she was thinking aheadand drugged him
with something thatwould contain his power.
To think she'd makea sacrifice of Jiraiya...
Well, it sounds just like Tsunade.
To think I'd already havemy handicap spotted.
You are sucha disgraceful guy as always...
Dang it. It kind of ticks me offwhen the Pervy Sage is mocked.
Summoning... Jutsu!
The Nine-Tailed Fox kidfrom the Chunin Exam.
I wonder if I should've killed him then,after all.
For the sake of the Akatsuki organization,
I acknowledged his achievement...and let him slide by.
But the only ones who can breaka Five-Pronged Spell
are the Sannin membersand the Third Hokage.
Which means Jiraiya may havealready taught it to Naruto.
Perhaps.
If he's able to controlthe Nine-Tailed Fox's power...
Oh...
Th-This is...
It doesn't quite look to be so.
He isn't endowed with Shinobi abilityto begin with, so...
Why?
He's still got a long way to go,sure enough.
Why?!
Hello.
Hey, Gamatatsu.Why did you come out?
Oh, Brother Gamakichi.
It's the first time I've been Summoned.
I-I wonder if I can do my best?
Idiot. Get some snacksor something and hide.
What? I can get snacks?Goody-goody.
Here I go.
I'll take Jiraiya.
I leave the rest to you.
It's unfortunate...
Here I also wanted to fight Lord Jiraiya,one of the Sannin.
Naruto!
Your opponent is me.
Earth Style! Dark Swamp!
Dang it. I can't completely sink themwith such a puny swamp.
The drug is still working.
But...with this, the snakes can't move.
Ninja Art! Poison Fog!
I'll be up a creek ifI take even one breath.
My leg tendons...!
I won't be eaten twice...!o way!
Here I go.
Ninja Art! Needle Jizo!
Dang it... The Jutsu isn't working well.
Even if we both have handicaps,you won't one-up me...
Give up now.
It's unfortunate...
Here I had respected youas a fellow Medical Ninja.
Stop. Stay back!
Please hang on, Lady Tsunade...
The Sannin name, which Lord Orochimaruis also called, will cry.
My body's heavy.
To think you who wereonce called the village madness
would ferry around such a kidand struggle tirelessly for the village.
You've really fallen, haven't you?
I have a keen eye to discern ability.
And that kid... is mediocrity in my eyes.
It's precisely for this reason...that I don't need the Uchiha kid.
It's no fun raising a geniuswho's good from the start.
So you can't leave him alone
because it's like you're lookingat your old self?
That kid can't beat Uchiha who inheritedthe inherent Sharingan Shinobi skill.
And that's because Narutodoesn't possess the Sharingan.
Shinobi ability is about whether
one can use and masterall the Jutsu of the world.
Ninja refers to onewho can use Ninjutsu.
Shinobi ability is no such thing.
You still don't get it?
A Ninja... is one who endures.
It's a difference of opinion, huh.
I'll teach you one thing.
What's most important for Shinobi ability...
isn't the number of Jutsuone possesses.
What's important is...
The mettle...
not to give up.
Enough already...you jerk!
The mettle to never give up...
He possesses that.
Heh. I don't know what Jutsu you learned,
but you can't hit me withsuch a large motion.
No good.
It won't easily hit witha moving opponent.
Owwee!
And the Chakra isn'tcompletely held, yet...
It seems you got a cracked thigh bonein your left leg
from the battle with the snake.
Well, you can still move ifit's just the bone.
But it's impossible now...
The lateral vastus musclein your right leg is totally cut off.
What should I do...?
That Jutsu of mine uses both hands.
If even one arm is taken out, it's over.
Are you scared of me?
Do you want to run away from here?
Naruto, as I recall,
you whooped it up like thisduring the first Chunin Exam.
Don't mess with me. I won't run away!
"Don't mess with me. I won't run away!"
"I'll take it. Even if I'm a Genin for life..."
"I'll become the Hokage at any cost,so it's okay with me."
"I'm not scared."
Can you...whoop it up in the same way now?
Unlike you...
I will be the heir to the Hokage nameno matter what!
- Hokage is my dream!- Hokage is my dream!
You're not a kid anymore,so you should stop whooping it up...
Depending on the situation,
when you want to give up and run away,you should run away.
Oh my... What's with that look?
You'll die! If you die,there are no dreams or anything...
Do you want to die?
You're still a Genin,so you should run away on the battlefield.
Don't tell a man to run away.
Kids think that everything is easy.
That's why they talk about foolish dreamslike nothing at all.
That's why they can't give up.
Jiraiya, was it youwho taught him that Rasengan?
Are you acting like a teacher by teachinga Jutsu that can't be learned?
Don't give him false hopes.
That's why a moony kid starts jokingthat he'll become the Hokage!
They chase after foolish dreams...and then die.
If I have three days,I'll master that Jutsu.
Then let's make a bet.
Bastard!
As for me... I stand by my words.
That's... my Way of Ninja!
A bet?
I'll give you one week.
If you can master that Jutsu,
I'll acknowledge thatyou'll be able to become the Hokage...
and give you this necklace.
You should've juststayed out of this...
Why?
Why?!
Old Lady Tsunade...
You're still going to get up?
Just like our wager
I will definitely winthat unlucky necklace from you.
Shadow Clone Jutsu!
Shadow Clone won't do anything now.
Enough... Don't protect me, Naruto.Stop it!
I told you that you'd dieif you were obstinate like that, right?
If you die, there will be no dreams,no nothing.
Just get out of the way. Run away.
Humph... It's okay.
I...
I absolutely will not die...
until I become the Hokage!
This way, I can hold on to you.Here I go!
It's the same Chakra movementas before.
No, this is...different.
I see.
In order to gain a handfor suppressing Chakra,
the Shadow Clone...
Compress Chakra and...
hold it completely.
Wha--?!
I-It can't be.
Rasengan!
I believe your promise,its a true heart give me courage
Always I feel itthe precious time with you
On your still shoulder
I feel the wind that blowstowards tomorrow
The city lights are like pieces of stars
That hold us together
"Each one of us glows differently, "
you say laughingly
but you look most dazzling
Like a comet,
like the rainbow after the storm
You bring light into my heart
Being lost can be the answer
Let's promise we won't cheat
Uh...like a shooting star,we do go ahead.
I never forget my ideal...
to develop the Village Hidden in the Leafand protect its people.
The Hokages have sacrificedtheir lives for that dream.
And now,I also will put my life on the line.
From this moment,I am the Fifth Hokage!
Next time: "The Fifth Hokage!A Life on the Line!"Press down hard on the gas
That's right, there's no compromise
We'll slip through the night
At the final moment push hard
That's right, all the way to zero,
Until we wipe away the days
Gently open your heart
If you pull it close to you
It will reach you, without a doubt
It will come, closer
Now
We're speeding through life,squeezing it for all of its worth
Our feet are tied
But we still keep going farther
Even if I take it back, and grasp it
If you're not the one
There will be no meaning
And so we'll go far off into the distance.

The waves of pain are coming faster...
Sasuke, you should quitthe preliminaries!
Huh?!
L-Look, you haven't been yourself
ever since you got worked overby that Orochimaru guy!
Yoroi Akado vs. Sasuke Uchiha
To think it'd be so soon...?!
I couldn't ask for more.
For the 1st battle,
Yoroi Akado and Sasuke Uchihahave been selected.
No objections, right?
-Right!-No!
The pain won't go away!
It appears the Curse Mark hurts.
Don't use the Sharingan.
So you knew?
If that Curse Mark onyour neck gets out of control,
it could endanger your life.
I believe it.
Well, the match will becalled off at that time.
I'll be coming in to stop it,so good luck.
Called off, you say?!
It seems this Curse Mark thingis responding to my Chakra.
In other words, in this match,
I can hardly use evenmy regular Jutsu,
not to mention the Sharingan!
However... Yoroi's ability isthe worst for you, Sasuke.
Now then, please begin.
You... my Chakra...
You just noticed now...?
Bushy-Brow's Jealousy-Lions Barrage Unleashed!
You... my Chakra...
You just noticed now...?
Yes... Yoroi has unorthodox abilityto absorb Chakra.
It's a magnificent art thatabsorbs spiritual and physical energy
simply by holding his palm againstan opponent's body.
And, if all of your Chakrais absorbed, Sasuke,
you'll be forced to rely uponthe power of my Curse Mark...
Now, release that luscious power...!
That is the only wayyou have to survive.
You... little!
To think you still have strength left...
Though you're just a guinea pig.
That was a close one...
Put your mind at ease...I'll end this right away!
What's the matter, what's the matter?!
You already finished?!
His aim is one, close-quarter fight.
What should I do!?
At this rate, things will go downhill...
Sasuke Uchiha...Is this the best you can do?
Sasuke...
Sasuke!
You call yourself an Uchiha with that?
Don't be looking so lame!
Give your best!
That guy...
That's it!
Oh!
You can't afford to be inattentive!
I'll finish you with this!
Is this as far as it goes...?
He...vanished?!
That's my...!
What?!
Huh?
But then...from here on is my original.
It's over...
The Dancing Leaf Shadow...?!
Eat this!
Dang it...!It's responding every time...
Please...!
I'm begging you...
Stop!
You! Sasuke!Don't be looking so lame!
To think they'd be worried about me...
Is this it...?
I won't be swallowed up...by this thing...
No way!
The Curse Mark receded!?
Here I go!
You're weak!
You're weak.
I'm not done, yet!
Lions Barrage!
There's no need to check.
I'm stopping the match fromgoing any further...
Therefore, the winner of thefirst battle, Sasuke Uchiha...
passes the preliminaries!
Yes!
Well. Good job...
Before that Lions Barrage,
your movements were thatof Guy's Taijutsu...
So you copied it with the Sharingan
when you wrangled that one timewith that Lee kid?
Sasuke! You, you...
won in a lame way!
Look at you, all battered up!You idiot!
Man, that loser...
Sasuke... Thank goodness.
Okay, I'll win, too!
Lee... Because of you,I've managed to save my neck.
Things would've gotten hairy
if I hadn't seen your techniquein close-quarters combat.
But it doesn't appear to be a techniquethat I can use heavily.
I see... So before, he copied a partof the technique I only used once?
Sharingan!
That's your ability...
Sasuke... you're quite a person.
You get rapidly stronger...
I kind of...feel a bit of fear.
For a sequence ofhigh-speed Taijutsu Lotus movements,
it's impossible to acquire thiswithout training
that whittles away flesh and blood.
No matter how much youuse the Sharingan,
it can't just be mastered ina short space of time...
Moreover, his idea for thatfinishing move...
Kakashi... this boy reminds meof when you were a kid...
Last year's number one rookiewas Neji Hyuga.
This year's number one rookieis Sasuke Uchiha.
I wonder which one is stronger...?
Really, he's something else.
To think he'd develop the true powerof the Sharingan in situation like this...
What's most to be feared...is the Uchiha ability?
That was surprising...
To think he brought the Curse Markthat was getting out of control
into submission with his will...
Tsk. Again?
It just make it more interesting!
Yeah! He is Sasuke after all...
This is as far as we'll go...
I'm hungry...
W-Wow!
Nothing special.
Magnificent...
Sasuke Uchiha...
We medics will give youthe best of treatment.
You guys are out of your territory.
Huh?!
I'll take him under my care...
Now, I'll take you into the back...
and seal the Curse Mark.
Can we wait untilthe preliminaries are over?!
I want to watch the matchesof those who will remain in the main battle.
No!
Don't get so heated.
If we let things beany further,
the situation might become irrevocable.
I won't accommodate you anymore.
Now then, come on...
Sasuke...
Hm?
Sakura... Speaking of which,during the match...
did you see something that lookedlike a strange wound on Sasuke's neck?
What?
Please promise me...
Don't say anything aboutthis bruise to Naruto.
What?
Listen... this is also teamwork.
It won't do to have himunnecessarily worried.
I-I don't know either.
I see...
Umm, now then...
We will get right to it andbegin the second match.
Abumi Zaku vs. Shino Aburame
Which weakling is it?!
Both of you, come forward.
We will now begin the second match.
That's the Sound Ninja...
The guy who had bothhis arms broken by Sasuke!
It seems like you're proudof your arms...
You!
S-Stop it!
He's going to fight with those arms?
I wonder if Shino is going to be okay...
He's fine. He's strong!
What...?
I'd square off with anybody except him...
Now then, please begin.
Now, Zaku...
How you fight will be a sight to see...
If you fight here,you'll be finished...
Withdraw!
Somehow, this one still works, so...
One arm is enough to take care of you!
You can't beat me withjust one arm.
Stop pestering me!
Take this!
Slicing Sound Wave!
Okay.
Hang in there.It'll be over right away.
Curse Sealing!
Next time, even if that Curse Markstarts kicking in again...
the power of this Curse Sealingshould suppress it.
However, this Sealing Jutsu makesthe strength of your will its foundation.
If something happens likeyou not believing in your own strength
and that will were to weaken...
the Curse Mark willonce again start to rage.
Out of character.
It appears he's quite tired...
To think you've become able tohandle Sealing Jutsu...
You've grown, eh, Kakashi...?
You...
Long time no see, Kakashi.
Orochimaru...
Hey, can you hear it?
The clear, blue sky goes on and on
The ocean spans limitlessly
Please keep that smile on your face forever
Or else I'll cry
You won't have to search around you
It's all ok now.
Everyone is insidethis hand
when you want to cry,and you want to run away
When you forget what happiness is
Just sing.
Light is born, and darkness was born
The two are one
Harmonia, feel the telepathy
Hey, can you hear it?
This is surprising.
I never thought you'd appear.
Why are you after Sasuke?What's your purpose?!
Even though you're one ofthe legendary three Ninja,
I must not retreat.
I'll stop you here,even if it costs my life!
Next episode: "Kakashi and Orochimaru:Face-to-Face!"
Well, it's sink or swim.Press down hard on the gas
That's right, there's no compromise
We'll slip through the night

Where is... this place...?
Who is it?
Me...from long ago?
Father and mother didn't need to die!
Everyone was killed.
I had no power so...
the clan vanished.
Battle Formation: Ino-Shika-Cho!
Ino... Why?
I can't let you upstage mein front of Sasuke!
Squirming again...
The Leaf Village worms wandered in.
What are the two of you thinking?!
They're bad news!
It's a pain, but it can't be helped!
Ino steps out andwe men should run?
Sorry to get you involved.
But anyway we'rea Three-Man Squad, after all.
We're all in this together, aren't we?
Well, we'll see.
No! I don't want to die yet!
Let go of my scarf!
You're annoying! Quit wiggling!
It's okay for you to drop out, fatso.
What did that guy just say?
I....didn't quite catch it.
Huh?!
That word is taboo to Choji.
Try saying it again...
I said if you have a problem,pull out, fatso.
Fatso... fatso... fatso... fatso... fatso
I'm not fat, I'm just big-boned!Blast it!
Hurraaaay for Big-Boned!
W-Wow...
All right! You understand this, right?!
This is a battle between Leaf and Sound!
Lucky! He's lost it!
No way, this looks like it's goingto be a pain in the butt.
That's my line.
I was told to get Sasukeby the end of the test...
Sasuke...
Sakura...
The two behind...take care of them.
Okay!
Well then, Team Ino,let's go full throttle!
Right!
Formation Ino!
- Shika!- Cho!
I'm counting on you, Choji
Okay!
Expansion Jutsu!
Next, Leaf Style Taijutsu!
Human Boulder!
What is this Jutsu?
Isn't it just a fat guy rolling?
Slicing Sound Wave!
You!
He jumped?!
The air pressure ofSlicing Sound Wave
is less than effectiveagainst that rotation.
Even if I do the Super Sound Wave,if I'm touched by something like that
the bones in my arms will be crushed!
Think I'll let you?!
You're the most annoying so...
Ninja Art!
Shadow Possession Jutsu!
My body!
Huh?!
Dosu?!
What are you doing at a time like this?!
Shadow Paralysis Jutsu?
Ino, next it's just the ladies.
Okay, Shikamaru, look after my body.
Gotcha!
Huh?
Ninja Art, Mind Transfer Jutsu!
Shoot!
Kin!
What happened?
This...is the end of it.
You guys!
If you make one move,this girl named Kin is dead meat!
If you don't want thisto end right here,
leave your scroll and walk away!
Once you've gone far enough thatI can't feel your Chakras,
I'll release this girl!
These guys...What are they grinning about?
- Choji!- Yeah!
This isn't good! They won't...!
Ino!
Uggghh. I’m dizzy.
W-What kind of person...hurts their own comrades?
Careless.
Our goal is not the scrolls orto pass this test playing by the rules.
What?
It's Sasuke.
Humph...
My Jutsu...
So your much preciousShadow Paralysis Jutsu
is limited to 5 minutes?
It's not Shadow Paralysis.It's Shadow Possession Jutsu.
In addition, it seems thatthis girl's Jutsu...
seems to be a Jutsu totake over the other's body.
From the looks of the bloodshe's spitting up,
if I kill Kin, that girl will die too...
Are you going to do in...your teammate?
If I need to...
This is no good.
Shoot...
That's too bad...you're just a step away.
You're too easy-going.
Hmph, I don't like this at all.
You minor Sound Ninjas...
Bullying the second-rate guys andputting on airs like a winner.
What?!
They're Lee's teammates...
Lee!
You goofed.
Hah! Coming out of nowherelike cockroaches...
That kid with the bob lying over thereis on our team, but...
But you messed with him, didn't you?!.
What's with his eyes?
It's like they see through everything...
If you're gonna continue,I'll fight with full strength!
Huh?
What 's wrong? Neji...
This Chakra...
If you don't like me,don't play cool, come down here.
No. Evidently, there's no need for that.
After all...
without power...
I can't do anything!
Because I had no power...Everyone was killed!
No...You let them be killed.
You only... watched.
If only I had power...
If only I had power...
Sasuke! You're awake...Huh?!
Huh?
That's...
Sasuke?
Sakura...
Sakura...
Who did this to you?
Who is it?
The Curse Marks runaround his entire body?!
Sasuke...That body...?
Don't worry.
On the contrary,strength is rapidly flowing in...
Right now I feel good.
That guy gave this to me.
Huh?
At last I understand...
I'm an Avenger...
On my road, I must put powerinto my hands...
even if it means abandoningmyself to the devil.
So... I see...
So the mark on the neckthat this girl called Sakura spoke of
is this Curse Mark.
But...
I didn't think he could stand up...
Sakura, tell me...
Who harmed you...?
Me!
Huh?
Ino!
If you stay like thatyou're gonna get involved!
Come back to this body!
Choji, you too,come over here and hide.
Y-Yeah.
Uh-oh.
Release!
Okay, she's back!
Shikamaru!
What's going to happen now?
How should I know?
Wha--?!
W-What's this...?
No matter...
how you look at it....
his Chakras are...
too big!
Dosu, this half-dead bastardis nothing to be scared of!
Stop, Zaku! Don't you understand?!
I'll take care of all of them...
in one fell swoop!
Super Sonic Slicing Wave!
Heh! He must have been blown to pieces.
- Who did?- Huh?!
Zaku!
He's fast!
Moreover, he took in those two,and in the blink of an eye.
Fire Style!
Phoenix Flower Jutsu!
Don't push your luck!
I'll blow them off!
What?!
Shuriken's in the fire?!
Zaku, below you!
The quality of the Chakrais completely different...
Is that really Sasuke?
What happened?What in the world...?
It seems like you'reproud of your arms...
You!
S-Stop it!
Sasuke will definitely come for me.
You're the only one left.
You...
make it a little more fun for me.
This isn't...
This isn't...
This is not like...
Sasuke!
S-Stop!!
Stop it.
Please...
Stop.
The Curse Mark is withdrawing...
We're saved for now.
Sasuke!
You're strong.
Sasuke... We can't defeat youthe way you are now.
This is our fee for settling this...
Please let us withdraw from here.
Huh?
It seems selfish, but we now havesomething we need to confirm, too.
That being said,let's make a promise.
If there's another opportunity tobattle with you in this test,
we won't run or hide.
Wait!
Who in the world is Orochimaru?
What did he do to Sasuke?!
Why Sasuke?!
I don't know...
We were just given orders tomake the hit on Sasuke.
Though you ordered us toassassinate Sasuke,
you got to him first.
Moreover, you didn't kill him,and left that Curse Mark instead.
I don't know what you're thinking...
Hey! Are you okay?!
It's a pain, but Ino,I'll leave Lee to you.
Got it.
That Chakra...It's abnormal.
The Uchiha clan...this good, huh?
Sakura's in danger!
It's okay...I'll protect Sakura.
Well, what should we dowith this guy?
Kick him awake?
Can I do it?
What am l...?
Sasuke...
Hey, can you hear it?
The clear, blue sky goes on and on
The ocean spans limitlessly
Please keep that smile on your face forever
Or else I'll cry
You won't have to search around you
It's all ok now.

Harmonia, feel the telepathy
Hey, can you hear it?
Hey, what's up Akamaru?
Wait a minute, Naruto,he's acting strange.
What, are you hungry?
Doesn't seem like it.How about a walk?
I know. You're looking foran electric pole, aren't you?
He bit me!
Next episode: "Akamaru Trembles:Gaara's Cruel Strength!"
What in the world doyou want, anyway?Press down hard on the gas

What?!
O-Oh!
T-That's...
It's the empty shell of sand!
Lee's Hidden Strength:Forbidden Secret Jutsu!
When did that...?!
That's not possible!
While you had your eyes closedand were praying.
What?
For a moment, Lee stopped movingbecause of the pain in his body.
At that moment... that's when!
Gaara!
That's...!
There's no doubt about it - his eyes...
He's completely awake...
The demon... inside him.
Run away!
That Bowl-Cut's totally worn down...
Gaara is toying with him.
W-Why doesn't Lee dodge?
With Lee's speed, he should easily beable to dodge that level of attack.
It's not that he doesn't dodge,it's that he can't dodge.
What?!
What do you mean?
The Lotus is a double-edged sword.
What do you mean double-edged sword?
Why do you think the Lotus isa forbidden technique?
Well...
The Lotus isn't a Ninjutsu or a Genjutsu.
It's a Taijutsu, with that muchhigh-speed movement.
The load it puts on a person's bodyis beyond imagination.
So Lee's entire body is inso much pain right now
that even moving is out of the question.
Isn't that so...
Guy?
But that's...!
He has no Ninjutsu, not evenone Genjutsu...
Moreover, the Taijutsu he depends on,
it's now even less thanan average person's...
There's no way he can win!
He's had it if this goes on...
Lee...
Hey, get a move on all of you.
I'll add another 200 laps!
Stupid! There's no wayyou'll become a Ninja.
Yes, I will.
There's no way a chump who can'teven use Ninjutsu can become a Ninja!
Yes, I will!
Whatever, but the fact that a guy likeyou without Ninjutsu or Genjutsu
and with less Taijutsu thanan average person
is in this Ninja academy is nonsense.
Do you know what you're called here?
Hot-Blooded!
Hot-Blooded!
Hot-Blooded lose-
Hey, get in line, Lee!
Hey Lee!
So that's the hot-blooded losereveryone's talking about.
Doesn't he look likesomeone we know?
Huh?
In particular... his eyebrows.
Hmm...
Rock Lee...
The chump who can only performless than average Taijutsu...
But you...
You practiced your lessthan average Taijutsu...
You practiced it over andover again like crazy...
396...397...398...399...
400... 401...402... 403...
If I can't do a log kick 500 times,then it's 1,000 squats!
41 3... 414...
41 5... 41 6... 417... 41 8...!
41 9... 420...
So someone's here before me...
422... 423... 424...
425... 426...
I suppose I'll come back...
If I can't do 1,000 squats,then it's 2,000 punches!
795... 796... 797... 798...
He's still at it...!
2,000 punches!
If I can't, it's 2,000 jump ropes!
You recklessly practiced onlyTaijutsu and eventually...
All right, you've all becomeGenin as of today,
so I'd like to know whatit is you're all aiming for!
Yes, yes, yes, yes!
Tenten.
I'd like to become a powerful Ninjalike the legendary Kunoichi Tsunade!
Hmm...
And, how about you, Neji?
I don't want to answer...
I...!
I'd like to prove that I couldbecome a respectable Ninja
even though I can't useinjutsu or Genjutsu!
That would be the ultimate for me!
Those are good serious eyes...
Humph!
You!
What's so funny?!
I'm serious!
I will become a respectable Ninjaeven only with Taijutsu!
He should give up already...
At this rate...
He will simply die with Gaarajust toying with him...
Bushy Brows...!
Lee...
Not yet... Not yet!
Lee, you just won't learnyour lesson, will you?
There's no way you can win...
Unlike you, Neji is a genius.
A genius...?
What is a genius?!
Even though I may not have talent,I'll exceed genius with my efforts.
That is my entire being!
That is my Way of the Ninja!
You'll get nowhere, Lee...
No matter how much effort you make,
there's no way you can take me down.
That's simply a fact.
That's not true!
That's not...
But you...refused to give up, not ever!
Such meaningless actions...
The Bowl-Cut was unlucky tohave Gaara as his opponent!
No...
Lee's not one to give upwith this much.
- What?- Huh?
The reason is that Lee...
The reason is that Lee...
You...continued to make effort.
If I can't jump rope 1,200 times,I'll log kick 2,000 times!
1,116... 1,117...!
1,118... 1,11--!
Huh?!
Lee!
Are you taking a break already?
Guy Sensei...
What is it that you want?
If it's about my blunder withthe recent assignment,
I believe I've apologized.
Lee... It's true you're different from Neji.
You have no Ninjutsu or Genjutsu skills,and you're not a Taijutsu genius either...
But Lee...
you have powersthat exceed Neji...
you're a genius with hidden potential.
If you're trying to make me feel better,please stop!
Idiot!
I'm not trying to make you feel betteror anything!
The reason is that you are...
a genius of effort!
I wonder if...
If that's true...?
I've... I've believed that to be true...
That if I trained harder than Neji...2 or 3 times as much...
that I'd surely become stronger.
But...
I've recently begun to think that...
I can't beat a real genius.
Is effort really rewarded...?
I've wanted to know this and
so I've taken on Neji,but it's always been the same...!
I'm no match for him at all!
Even when I'm on a mission...
My legs still tremble even now...
I think that I'll never becomestronger though I strive and strive...
I am so afraid that I can't bear it!
What am I to do...?
There's no point in making the effortif you don't believe in yourself!
Lee, you're very similar to me.
Do you mean our eyebrows?
No, not just our eyebrows...
I was actually a failure once too...
You were, Sensei?
But now, I can even win againstthe genius elite Kakashi,
because of my efforts...
"I'd like to prove that I can becomea respectable Ninja
even though I can't use Ninjutsuand Genjutsu" you said.
That's your Ninja way, right?
That's a fine goal...
It's a fine goal worth sticking to!
That's why you should believe inyour path and forge straight ahead!
Become a man powerful enoughso that I can just watch you smiling!
Understand, Lee?!
Yes!
Thank you...Guy Sensei...!
Stop, Lee!
If you fight any more, you'll die!
Bushy Brows...
What?!
Movement has...
... returned to Lee!
Sensei is smiling and watching me...
And just because of that,I can come back stronger!
Stronger... stronger still!
Lee's smiling...even thoughhe's been driven into corner.
No.
It's his turn to do the driving.
Huh?
The Leaf's Lotus blossoms twice.
Blossoms twice...?
Lee said that too!
The Leaf's Lotus blossoms twice.
When we meet the next time,I vow that I will be an even stronger man.
No, Guy!
You haven't?!
It's exactly as you imagine.
So that Genin...
that boy can open the Eight Inner Gatesin his body and use the Hidden Lotus...
The Hidden Lotus?
That's right...
This is incredible...
Guy...
How many of the Eight Inner Gatescan that boy open now...?
Five gates.
What exactly is it?
These Eight Inner Gates andthat Hidden Lotus?
The Eight Inner Gates are"Limiter Releases"
used in preparations forreaching the Hidden Lotus.
A "Limiter Releases"?
That's right...
In the Chakra Networkwhere chakra flows,
there are eight places where thechakra points are concentrated
in each area of the body from thehead area down--
the Gate of Opening, Gate of Rest,Gate of Life, Gate of Pain,
Gate of Closing, Gate of Joy,Gate of Shock and Gate of Death.
These are called the Eight Inner Gates.
These eight gatescontinually "limit"
the amount of Chakra flowingthrough the body...
However, the Lotus's essence is to forcethe boundaries of these "limits" to open...
and bring out severaltens of times the body's strength.
The Primary Lotus...
opens only the first gate,the Gate of Opening,
and releases the brains restraints
to bring forth a person's muscles' strengthto its fullest!
That's the kind of technique it is.
So...what is the Hidden Lotus?
After forcing the stamina to increaseat the second gate, the Gate of Rest...
From the third gate, the Gate of Life,one enters the Hidden Lotus!
No way!
Even after using just the Primary Lotus,his body was in shambles.
So if he uses a technique beyond that...
That's right.
Huh?
By opening all the 8 gates,
one attains strength exceedingeven the Hokage, but in return...
one dies!
I don't intend to pry into what thatboy means to you
or to tell you not to bringyour personal feelings into play...
But there is a limit!
I've misjudged you...Guy!
What do you know... about that boy?!
There is something important which
that boy wants to prove andprotect even if it costs him his life.
I'd like to prove that I can becomea respectable Ninja
even though I can't useinjutsu and Genjutsu!
That would be the ultimate for me!
That's why l...
wanted to make him a manthat could protect that thing.
That's all there is...
Lee!
I'm going to teach youa new technique.
Yippie, yeah!
- One that will be your trump card.- Yeah, that's great!
Yippie, yeah! Yippie yeah!
Lee, listen to my explanationseriously, all right?!
Y-Yes, Sensei!
Let me first say that...
this is more of a forbidden Jutsuthan the Primary Lotus!
And it will become themost special technique for you.
Special...?
However...
there is one strict conditionfor using this technique.
That is...
That is...
What?
I don't know whatyou're planning to do...
But this is the end for you.
That's true...
In any case...it will be the end with the next.
Neji...
Sasuke...and...
There is no way that I alonecan lose in a place like this!
Guy Sensei...please allow this...!
It is now!
The time to carry through andprotect one's own Way of the Ninja!
The Third Gate of Life...open!
Hey, can you hear it?
The clear, blue sky goes on and on
The ocean spans limitlessly
Please keep that smile on your face forever
Or else I'll cry
You won't have to search around you
It's all ok now.
Everyone is insidethis hand
When you want to cry,and you want to run away
When you forget what happiness is
Just sing.
Light is born, and darkness was born
The two are one
Harmonia, feel the telepathy
Hey, can you hear it?
Effort is always rewarded.My belief in this has brought me this far.
Neji, Sasuke, and Naruto...
There's no way that I can losein a place like this!
Even though this technique ismy ace in the hole,
I'll show it especially to you!
This is my ultimate secretTaijutsu technique!
Next Episode: "The Fifth Gate:A Splendid Ninja is Born"
This is the end!Press down hard on the gas
That's right, there's no compromise
We'll slip through the night
At the final moment push hard
That's right, all the way to zero,
Until we wipe away the days
Gently open your heart
If you pull it close to you
It will reach you, without a doubt
It will come, closer
Now
We're speeding through life,squeezing it for all of its worth
Our feet are tied
But we still keep going farther
Even if I take it back, and grasp it
If you're not the one
There will be no meaning
And so we'll go far off into the distance.

If there's an instance that webecome separated,
don't trust him if he lookslike your teammate.
Just like now there's a possibility
that an enemy will transformto get close to us!
Yeah.
So what do we do?
We'll decide on a password.
Password?
I'll only say it once so listen closely.
You ask Ninja song, "Ninja Chance."
And the answer is this:
"lt is a chance to sneak up where a largenumber of enemies are making a scene.
"The quiet place hasno secret hideout.
"lt is important fora Shinobi to know the right time.
"The time when an enemyis tired and drops his guard."
That's it.
H-Huge!
T-Tail!
You want our Earth Scroll, don't you?
Well, let's begin...
the battle for the Scrolls.
Life or death!
If this creature doesn't wantto spit me out...
I'll make it to do so at any cost!
Shadow Clone Jutsu!
I can't move!
I wanted you to entertain me more.
It's too bad.
Move!
He wiped out the fear with pain.
As expected,he's not the average prey.
Don't come near me!
Don't lower your guard,not even for a moment...
A prey must always stay tenseand flee desperately
before a predator!
Sorry Sasuke.
Naruto!
The password... I forgot it!
Naruto's Counterattack:ever Give ln!
The password... I forgot it!
That's all right, Naruto!
Awesome!
Naruto!
I know you tried to be cool andintended to rescue us, but...
Don't put your nose in this!
Escape!
This thing...She's on a far different level!
Seems like you brought thatgiant snake down brilliantly, Naruto.
No matter how you look,she looks like a snake...
I get it, it was the handiworkof this woman.
The situation has never gotten any betterwith him showing up for the rescue.
But what should I do...?
Hey hey hey! Evidently you've beenbullying the weakling!
Now that l, Naruto Uzumaki is here,
I'm going to wipe the floor with you!
Darn it! If it continues like this,all three of us are done for!
What should I do?
Sasuke...
It's no good.
This is the only way.
Wait.
Hmm?
- Huh?!- Huh?
If it's the scroll you want,I'll give it to you.
I'm asking you.Just take this and go.
Huh?!
What?!
Hey, Sasuke!What are you doing?
Why are you givingour scroll to the enemy?
You, shut up!
What...?!
I see...You're sensible.
The only thing the "prey" canhope for from the "predator" is
presenting other food andpray you would be spared, isn't it?
Take it.
Wha--?!
You! Don't interfere with this!
Don't you understand this situation?!
What're you doing all of a sudden?!
As for me,I don't remember the password...
So I got no way to make sure.
But you, you're an imposterSasuke, aren't you?
Naruto!
W-What are you trying to start?!
You loser!I'm the real me!
Liar.
This, this stupid coward is...absolutely...not the Sasuke I know!
I don't know how strong she is but,
how can you be sure that she'll let usgo if we hand over the Scroll, huh?!
You're the one who choked anddoesn't understand this situation!
Naruto.
That's correct.
The Scroll.
I could just kill youand seize it.
Don't mess with me!
Run, Naruto! Stop it!
Darn it!
I've lost confidence in you, Sasuke!
Summoning Jutsu!
Naruto!
There are three corpses.
This is some kind of Ninja Art,isn't it...?
This is bad.
We have a problem,from the get go.
I'll be darned.
Inform Anko,the Proctor of the second test.
Yes, sir!
If you're going to have dumplings,you've got to have sweet red bean soup.
Okay...Once I've eaten this,
I should break through andgo wait at the tower for the kids.
With this program, the quick kidsshould clear it soon.
The Leaf Village mark, perfect!
We have a problem, Ms. Anko!
Huh? What, so suddenly?
Corpses! Three of them!
Moreover, they're strange.
Anyway, please come!
Strange?
I checked their possessionsand identification,
Ninjas from Grass Villageregistered in the Chunin Exam, but...
As you can see...
They have no faces.
Yes.
They're smooth and flat,like they melted away.
Without a doubt...
This Jutsu is...
that man's...
Why is he at this test...?
Show me the lD photos ofthese three Grass Village Ninjas.
It's on their applications.
Yes!
So this one's face was robbed.
Then, at that time it was already...
I'll return... the Kunai knife.
Thank you for your trouble.
We're in big trouble.
Huh?!
Communicate this toLord Hokage right away!
Make a call for action tothe Anbu Black Ops
to assemble more than two squadsto the Forest of Death!
Starting now,I'm going to follow these guys!
Got it?
Yes!
That guy...
That guy...has come to Leaf Village!
Cute.
You're such a cute prey.
Naruto!
Narutooo!
Well, polish him off.
Shove it!
This brat! Can't be...
Naruto... He's lost control...
But...that Naruto,why is he so strong?!
Those eyes...
There's no mistake.
That's...Naruto?!
This just got interesting.
Next is...
Sasuke.
Now what's your move?!
Sasuke!
I have to hurry.
I get this...
bad feeling.
Hey. Are you hurt?
Scaredy cat?!
Naruto!
Hey!
Are you hurt...
Scaredy cat?
Sasuke!
This stupid coward is absolutelynot the Sasuke I know!
Huh?!
Darn it!Let me go!
You stupid snake!
To think that thenine-tailed brat lived...
When you get excited, a bitof the nine-tail's power trickles out...
You've grown up interesting.
Look...
The Seal is appearing onyour skin like a tattoo.
Five-Pronged...Sealing!
Sasuke! Help Naruto!
Twelve years since the seal...
Naruto's Chakras and the nine-tail'sChakras are beginning to act in synch...
But now... you're in the way.
He's gonna fall as it is!
Naruto!
What happened Sasuke?!
Sasuke...
Naruto's certainly differentfrom you, Sasuke.
He's a klutz andkind of gets in the way.
But he's not in the least a coward!
Right?Isn't that right?
You foolish little brother.
If you want to kill me,resent me, hate me and...
continue to live your ugly life.
Flee.
Flee and hang on to your life.
No!
Just what I expect of the Uchiha clan...his blood has begun to stir...
Sasuke!
I should take my time andconfirm his true power.
Hey, can you hear it?
The clear, blue sky goes on and on
The ocean spans limitlessly
Please keep that smile on your face forever
Or else I'll cry
You won't have to search around you
It's all ok now.
Everyone is insidethis hand
when you want to cry, and you want to run away
When you forget what happiness is
Just sing.
Light is born, and darkness was born
The two are one
Harmonia, feel the telepathy
Hey, can you hear it?
I'm an avenger.
To defeat my brother,today I have to survive!
But how can a person who won't riskhis life in a situation like this
beat my brother?
Calm down, you should be able to see.
There should be some wayto intercept her movements.

Master Jiraiya... I believe in you.
The Summoning Jutsu:Wisdom of the Toad Sage!
Well well...
You don't sleep at all?
What do you want?
I thought I'd crush you now.
If I do that,there'd be the possibility for me,
after the first battle,to be able to fight Sasuke.
I know your Sand attack.
I wonder which is faster,yours or my Sound.
In the full moon...
in the full moon, his blood boils.
W-What the heck...are you?
Amazing... So that's his true form?
But... is it okay?He's a Sound Ninja...
It's all right.He's long since served his purpose.
I thought he was a guinea pigin order to see...
the power of the boycalled Sasuke or something...
Why...is he with the Sand Ninja?
No, that's not necessary anymore...
Actually, I'd already been orderedto seize Sasuke.
But I failed...
What did you say?
That's right.
...for the likes of you?
Are you looking to take me on?
You willful little brat...Don't mess around with grown-ups.
Don't be so arrogant.The situation is in my favor.
It's also been found out thatI'm a minion of the Sound.
Then... if they find out that you'rehaving a secret meeting here with me...
the plan to destroy the Leaf Villageand everything will be for naught!
I heard...that you're Orochimaru's right-hand man.
Being revealed to them and comingnonchalantly to meet with me...
You must be a fool.
Well...to be exact, my true identitywasn't found out...
I let them find out.
I wanted to see how farthe Leaf Village would go...
Even after that it wouldn'tbe too late to seize Sasuke.
If you guys are going to fail,we'll back off immediately...
It's a plan that was originallyposed by the Sound, so.
The Sand is invisible untilthe last moment.
This is the will of the Kazekage.
Holy smokes...
That's fine.
This is the carry-out plan from Sound.
Okay.
And please...tell them aboutthis plan soon.
Yeah.
I know.
Okay, I'll be going.
To think our allied nation,the Village Hidden in the Sand,
has been already associatedwith the Sound...?!
I must tell Lord Hokage about this quick.
Oh, by the way...
I'll take care of the clean up.
No, I'll do it...
As the member of Sand Villageof the Land of Wind,
I must do what I can for my allies...
Besides... it's just one mouse.
It'll be easy.
Well well, it's Mr. Proctor.
What in the world are youdoing here alone?
It seems I have no choice,but to fight.
Leaf Style...
Crescent Moon Dance!
I can't pull it out.
This technique is...the Leaf Style Crescent Moon Dance.
Being able to manage itat such a young age.
As expected,this village is full of talented Ninja.
Your talent with a sword is superb.
But, a real sword with substancecan be stopped.
However... a Wind sword can'tbe stopped by anyone.
Take that!
That does it!
Nice, nice.
Hey...
This is paradise.
Hey, I said.
Isn't it time for you to turnthis way already?
If you join my training,I'll give you lots of "service."
P-l-e-a-s-e.
So you finally came out...I was waiting for you.
What?!
Are you making fun of me?
Right back at you.
I'm hungry.
Let's get back to the inn.
Owww, darn it!
Okay... I'll teach you a technique.
Do you really mean that?
Do you remember what I told youyesterday about the two types of Chakra?
Huh? Yesterday's talk?
You know, what you said about blueand red Chakra or something.
Oh... What about it?
You said that when a great powercame out, you felt red Chakra.
Yeah, it was like that.
Try building up that red Chakra right now.
Hmm. Even you say so...
I'll give it a try, but...
How about it?
Hmm, it's not right.
It's the same Chakra as always.
Jeez, you have no talent.
Don't be talking all high and mighty!
In the first place,
I really don't understand thosetwo types of Chakra myself!
Just keep trying.
Humph... So he doesn't understand it...himself, eh.
It seems Naruto himself still hasn'trealized that
the red Chakra isthe Nine-Tailed Fox's Chakra.
Well, guessing from his story...
it seems the excitement of dangerand heightened emotion
are the key to summonthe Nine-Tailed Fox Chakra.
No good, not good.
Only the usual Chakra's coming out.
Say, Pervy Sage...
What the heck does the red Chakra andthe technique you're going to teach me
have to do with each other?
Listen, boy.
For the techniqueI'm about to teach you,
the Chakra you've had until nowis not nearly enough.
Therefore, you'll have to able topull out and use the "other" Chakra
that has been dormant withinyou at any time you need.
But how do you know thatI have such a Chakra?
Oh, just what I wanted to hear.
Actually...
it's because I'm a sage.
Jeez... that's no answer.
Anyway, the special Chakrathat only you have
will become your greatest weapon.
Greatest weapon?
Not using that is like wasting treasure.
There's no need to forcedly dothe same training as everyone else.
Everyone has what they're good atand poor at.
You have your own style.
Your training until now, maintainingand releasing a set amount of Chakra,
was in other words,
training to control the suppression ofChakra so that you wouldn't get exhausted.
But you who have a lot of stamina
should be about power ratherthan a cheap trick.
You, who has two types of Chakraand doesn't exhaust easily,
should release the largest amountof Chakra you can
and train to increase the absolute amountof Chakra that you can use.
Then there are tons of Jutsuand techniques you can use.
What, for example?
For example... summoning Jutsuthat I'm going to teach you now.
Summoning?
Right.
It's a type of spatio-temporal technique
where you sign a contract in bloodwith all kinds of living creatures
and summon whenever you likewith Ninjutsu.
Oh! That sounds awesome.Teach me quick!
Before that...
first, it's necessary touse up all of your usual Chakra.
Okay!
Leave it to me.
Well... So you can use theShadow Clone Jutsu.
I have a good idea how to get ridof my Chakra quickly.
Well, you've multiplied quite a bit.
Listen up. We're going to havea battle royal now.
The last one left will bethe strongest me...
We're going to determinethe me among me!
- Yeah!- Yeah!
I see.Good thinking considering he's stupid.
Okay, let's go!
My, this is a sexually unattractive scene.
The finale is near at last.
Well done.
Sure enough, I'm the strongest me.
It looks like you've finally used upalmost all of your Chakra.
Now, at last I'll teach youthe technique.
Oh, I've been waiting!
First, I'll show you.
Watch carefully.
Summoning Jutsu!
Ooh, so cool.
Open that scroll.
It's a contract with thesummoning toads
that I've taken over from generations.
Sign your name in your own blood
and stamp the fingerprints of one handin blood under that.
Then build up Chakra in the placeyou want to summon
and set down the hand you contracted.
The Sign isBoar-Dog-Bird-Monkey-Sheep.
NA-RU-TO U-ZU-MA-KI.
Okay... This is fine, right?
It's easier for you to releasered Chakra right now.
So give it a try.
I already am.
Boar, Dog, Bird, Monkey, Sheep.
Ninja Art! Summoning Jutsu.
A tadpole...
This kid...has no talent, after all.
Hayate...what in the world happened?
One! First, Tyson jumps and slamdunks

Ino! When I was going to visitSasuke at the hospital by myself...
why are you coming along?
Besides, what is that flower all about?
A "rose for love"?That's so lame.
I chose this daffodil for him,hoping Sasuke will get better soon.
Next time, "A Feeling of Yearning,A Flower Full of Hope"

C'mon!
Running like a fugitive,
Being chased by something
Inside my heart is pounding
My throat dry like it's withering
For no single one,
To none does belong,
This time is ours, right now...
Unraveling the pain,
Unraveling our hearts,
Unraveling shadows
Stifling our breath,
Reaching for beyond,
Tearing through the dark
In fighting and in love
To the distant light above,
Yes, we are on the way
I wanna rock...
Rockin' my heart
Is this the first time youhave faced a friend's death?
This is the way of the Shinobi...
I won't forgive you...
I'm going to kill you!
White Past: Hidden Ambition
There's murder in his eyes!
He looks nothing like he used to!
He's coming!
What?
His Chakra repelled my attack!
Then...
This should do it!
Why?!
It can't be!
Could... Naruto's sealhave been broken...?!
No.
This feeling...
True, the seal is almost off
and the Chakra of the Nine-TailedFox Spirit is escaping, but...
Fortunately, the seal is notcompletely broken!
I still have some time!
Do you hear me, Zabuza?
We're both busy people.
I know it's against your style,
but I think it's about timewe stopped playing around.
Why don't we settle this onceand for all with the next move?
Interesting.
What can you possiblydo in this situation?
Kakashi, go ahead.Show me.
No good...
I can't hold his aura down!
Zabuza...
I can't defeat this boy.
Zabuza...
I'm...
You...from that time...
Why?
Why stop?
Even though I killed your dear friend,you can't kill me?
Damn it!
What happened to theforce from moment ago?
You can't defeat me withthat kind of strength.
Wasn't he someonespecial to you?
Is there someone specialin your life?
I want to protect someonespecial to me.
I want to make thatperson's dream a reality...
That's my dream.
Many people misunderstand.
They pity and don't finish offthe enemy they ought to finish.
They let them survive.
To me, that isn't compassionor anything.
Do you know?
How it feels tonot be needed by anyone?
To live day to day without a dream.The pain of it all.
What are you saying?
Zabuza has no usefor a weak Shinobi.
You took awaymy reason for existence.
Why?
Why do you have toserve a guy like that?
He gets the money from thugsto do bad things!
Is that No-Browthe only person special to you?
A long time ago,I had other people special to me.
They were... my parents.
I was born in the Land of Water,in a small village heavy with snow.
My parents worked on a small farm.
We were very poor,
but my parents seem tobe satisfied with it.
I was happy then...
They were loving parents.
But...
When I was old enoughto understand things,
something happened.
Something?
What happened?
My blood...
Blood?
Go on!
Tell me what happened.
My father...He killed my mother.
Then he tried to kill me.
Huh?!
After the experience ofthe ceaseless civil war,
people with Kekkei Genkai werehated and feared in the Land of Water.
Kekkei Genkai?
It's special powers or Jutsupassed on through certain clans,
from parent to child,or from grandparent to grandchild.
Because of their special powers,
those of the clans were exploited inall sorts of battles.
As a result, all Kekkei Genkaiwere feared
as harbingers of disasterand death.
After the war was over,
they decided to hidetheir special powers.
If anyone knew of their secret,only death could be expected.
I'm sure that boy went throughso much suffering as well.
The greater your power,the more you were feared.
My mother had the Kekkei Genkai.
She kept it secret from my father.
She hoped that for a while...
No, she must have thought thatthey could have a simple life forever.
Look, Mommy! Look!
Isn't it fantastic?
Not you, too!
Why? Why him, too?
That hurts, Mommy!
Sorry...
I'm sorry, Haku...
I'm sorry!
However...
Father had discovered our secret.
When I came to...
I had killed my own father.
And that moment,what I thought of myself was that...
no, that is what I had to think.
And then knew that it wasthe most painful thing.
The most... painful thing...?
That l...
that my existence didn't matterto anyone else in the world.
Same with me.
You told me that...
You'll be the best Ninja in the village,and make everyone respect you.
If someone comes along andaccepts you for who you are,
no one could be more importantto you than that person.
Even though he knew I was froma clan with Kekkei Genkai,
Zabuza took me in.
My power that everyone hated...He wanted it, needed it.
Brats like you won't be neededby anyone and die like dogs.
You have the same eyesas I do...
Brat...
Do you want...to be needed by someone?
Are you willingto give everything for me?
From now on,your power belongs to me.
Come with me.
I was so happy...
Haku, bad news.
I have to leave the Land of Wateras of tonight.
However, I'll be back inthis land some day.
I will rule over this land.
To do that...
what I need isn't consolation,encouragement or empty words.
What I really need is...
I already know.
You have nothing to fear.
I am your weapon, Zabuza.
Keep me by you as a mere toolthat heeds your every word.
You're a good boy!
I apologize, Zabuza.
I wasn't good enough to bethe tool you were looking for.
Naruto!
I want you...
to kill me.
Ninja Art, Summoning,Earth Style: Fanged Pursuit Jutsu!
Whatever you do won't work!
You have absolutely no ideawhere I am now.
However...
I know exactly where you areand what you're about.
Kakashi...
You are completelyin my hands now.
W-What is that racket?
What... Just what's going on out there?
If you can't use your eyes or ears,simply use your nose.
That's what happens
when you're closing your eyesin the midst of fog.
This is the Summoning Jutsuspecialized for pursuit.
I deliberately shed my own blood
to stop your attacks both timesfor this.
Your weapons have a thick scent ofmy blood on them now.
Those are my adorable Ninja Dogs.
And their sense of smellis without equal.
You're the one whowas playing into my hands.
The fog has lifted already.
And your future is...death.
I've had enough of your bluffs!
Don't act tough!
There's nothing you can doin this situation.
Your death is certain.
Zabuza.
You were too full of yourself.
You're too ambitiousfor your own good.
You assassinated the Mizukage,but failed to pull off a coup.
You left the service withfew men under you,
and became a Rogue Ninja.
Soon after, your name reachedour Hidden Leaf Village.
You needed to raise fundsto strike back.
And you needed to hide from
the Tracking Unit'spursuit and retaliation.
Isn't that about the reason
why you hired yourself outto scum like Gato?
Zabuza.
Do you really believe I've managedto survive with just Sharingan?
Here's something I didn't copy,a Jutsu of my own...
To enlighten you!
Lightning Blade!
What the...?!
His hand is visibly overflowingwith Chakra!
You are too dangerous.
Tazuna, the man you are tryingto assassinate
is the symbol of courage in this land!
The bridge he is buildingis the hope of this land!
And your ambitions will sacrificecountless lives.
That isn't how a Shinobiis supposed to behave.
Who cares?
I have always foughtfor my own ideals.
And that will never ever change!
I'll say it again.
Huh?
Give up.
Your future is...death!
Please kill me.
What are you hesitating for?
No...
What you said is ridiculous!
You're a weapon?Just a tool for him?
How can you call himspecial to you?
Are you really okay with that?
Is that wrong?
Huh?
Tell me, what is wrong with that?
Well, uh...
It's not...
Zabuza counts on me,even if I'm worthless.
He made me feel needed.
But now, I've lost my usefulnessthat affirmed my existence.
Zabuza no longer needs me.
That's why,I am now appealing to you.
Please, make it quick
W-Why did this happen?
Is this what it means tobe a strong Ninja?
To protect someone?
Are you okay with that?
Are you really okay with that?
I don't get it.I can never accept that!
Next episode:"The Weapons Known as Shinobi."
C'mon!
Running like a fugitive,
Being chased by something
Inside my heart is pounding
My throat dry like it's withering
For no single one,
To none does belong,
This time is ours, right now...
Unraveling the pain,
Unraveling our hearts,
Unraveling shadows
Stifling our breath,
Reaching for beyond,
Tearing through the dark
In fighting and in love
To the distant light above,
Yes, we are on the way
I wanna rock...
Rockin' my heart
Here we go!
I'm gonna take care ofmy duties with gusto again today!
Whoa! Mach 5!
A New Chapter Begins:The Chunin Exam
Oh!
Good morning, Sakura!
Hmph!
Oh, not again!
These two...
They've been sort of strange sincewe got back from the Land of Waves...
Oh, it's almost uncomfortable...
Hurry up and get here Kakashi Sensei!
Cha!
Well...Good morning, everyone...
Today I got lost.
Hey!
Hey, hey...Kakashi Sensei!
Our Group Seven always hasthe easy missions lately!
Aren't there more excitingmissions where I can be more active,
where I can use my Way of the Ninjaand my soul... you know?
Oh yes yes...
I basically understand whatyou're trying to say.
Shoot!
He's always making meindebted to him
and making himself look goodduring our missions!
I won't lose, no way!
You little...!
Today for sure!
Hmm...You are so much trouble!
That's what I'd like to say!
Hey! What 're you doing, Naruto?We're going on our mission!
Okay!
You've been so annoying for a while!
I'm not gonna lose to Sasuke!
Hey you!
What?
Oh, Mrs.!
I've gotten rid of all the weeds!
What?
What's wrong?
Those...those aren't weeds.
Huh?
Those are herbsI grew in my garden!
Ouch, ouch, ouch!
Somebody... help...!
No way! Free fall!
Huh?
You idiot.
Hey!
TRAP FlELDDO NOT ENTERDon't go over there!
Hey! Please stop!
That fool...
Oh no! That's because hestubbornly chose that big dog.
Hey, hey! Wait a minute,wait a minute!
That's the trap field over there...
Yikes!
Well! It's because you're so reckless!
Geez, you are so much trouble.
Zazuge--!
If you act up any more, I'll finish you!
Mmm...Teamwork hasn't been good lately.
That's right, that's right!
Sasuke, you're to blame forthe poor teamwork!
You're always attracting attention!
That's you, you idiot.
If you don't want to owe mebig time...
you just need to becomestronger than me!
It seems like they're gettingalong worse than before...
Shoot...This is frustrating!
There're plenty of guys outsidewho are stronger than I am...
Always making me go onthis kind of lame mission.
Well then...
Perhaps we should disperse.
I do need to submit a reportabout this mission.
Okay, then I'm going home.
Oh! Hey!
Sasuke, wait for me!
Hey, how about...Why don't you and...
Why don't we work on improvingour teamwork together?
You're just like Naruto.
JUST LlKE NARUTO
If you have time to spend on me,why don't you practice a Jutsu!
To tell you frankly,your abilities are less than Naruto's!
LESS THAN NARUTO...CHA!!Less than Naruto! Less than Naruto!Less than Naruto! Less than Naruto!
That's right...
It's always that way for meduring every mission.
I'll never be able to reallydo anything at all.
Sakura! Just let Sasuke be,and let's practice together!
Huh?
Sensei disappeared.
Was he being thoughtful?
Huh?
Pretending to be...a rock?
There's no such thing as a perfectlysquare rock with perfect holes!
It's totally obvious!
Just what you'd expect fromthe man I respect!
You are my rival, aren't you!
Hey! That's too much gunpowder!
With an adult sexiness!
I'm Moegi of the senior classat Kunoichi Preschool!
I love factoring!
Udon!
The most brilliant Ninja in the village!Konohamaru!
The three of us together arethe Konohamaru Gang!
Here we are!
I knew it was Konohamaruand friends.
Huh? Why are you all wearing goggles?
We're just copying whatyou used to do, bro!
Oh...
What's with the oh!
Your reactions have beenpretty cold these days!
So, did you want something?
See? Cold.
So, leader!Do you have some free time now?
Nah!
I have to train!
What?! You said you'dplay Ninja with us today!
Oh...? Is that right?
Geez...
If I played with these guysthey would make me hang out all day.
Hmph! Why would a Ninja play Ninja?
W-What is it?
So, abilities less than this guy, huh?
You are making me blushwith those stares...
Naruto, who's she?
She's been staring at him with eyeslike she's gonna kill him!
Oh!
You've been busierthan I thought, bro...
Huh?
Is she your...?
This?
Shucks, you guys arepretty sharp for kids!
No way!
Bro!
What are you doing?!
No! Leader!
His pulse, his pulse...!
You ugly wench! Ugly wench!
Huh?!
Nooooo!
Hmph!
Are you all right, Konohamaru?
Oweee...
Darn that broad foreheaded ugly wench!Is she a girl for real?
Yikes!
That hurt...
- Huh?- Huh?
So, I have formally receivedthe report from you.
Is Naruto getting along with the others?
Hmm?
Well, he's doing okay.
I've been busy lately.
I haven't had a chance to see himeven once since his return.
I'm a little concerned...
As you know, lruka Sensei,Sasuke is also in our squad,
and Naruto sees him as a rival,which is a little straining.
But, the result is that his abilitiesare developing significantly.
Almost to the point thathe might reach yours,
the one he respects!
I see...
I wonder what it is?
Shoot!
Right now?
These guys...
Konohamaru!
That hurt, little punk!
Stop that. You'll get yelled at later!
I'm sorry...I was fooling around...
What are these two?
Hey stop!Let go of that hand!
Huh! So these are Leaf Village's Genin...
Let's play with them beforethe strict one comes around.
Let go!
You're pretty lively,you little punk...
You jerk!
Wha--?!What was that?
Leaf Village's Genin areweaker than I thought.
T-These guys are foreign...
Why are they here?
Konohamaru...
Konohamaru!
Konohamaru!
It... It hurts...
Hey! If you don't let go of him,I won't forgive you! You fool!
You're the fool!
What are you gonna doby getting him worked up!
You're ticking me off.
I-I don't like little runts anyway.
On top of that,
you're a smart aleck forsomeone younger than me.
Makes me want to break him.
It's not on me.
What's with this guy?He's crazy...
Well, after this little squirt,it's the little runt that won't shut up!
You!
Huh?
What do you think you're doingin someone else's Village, you...
Sasuke!
He's pretty cute.
Bro!
Another little punk to tick me off!
Get lost!
Wow! So cool!
Naruto, you're lame!
S-Stupid! I would've quicklytaken down that thug too!
Hmph!
Sasuke, you!
Why're you always,always meddling like this!
Hey, come down here,you little punk!
You're the kind of smart alecklittle punk that I despise the most.
Wait! You aren't thinking ofusing Crow, are you?!
Kankuro, stop that.
Huh?
You're an embarrassmentto our village.
G-Gaara...
When did he get next to me?
It's stealthy footstepson the level of Kakashi...
There is no other reason tosummon you here other than...
As I assume you already understand,
based on the facesyou can see around...
So it's already that time...
The other Lands have alreadybeen notified, right?
I've seen them here and therein the village.
And, when will it be?
In a week...
That's very sudden.
Now... I will make theformal announcement.
Seven days from today...
On the first day of July,the Chunin Exam will begin!
Yes, yes, yes!
It's the Chunin Exam,it's the Chunin Exam!
If I were to win first place or something,becoming a Hokage would be closer!
There's no way I can lose!
Konohamaru, you think so too, right?
What?
Who the heck snatched up Moegi,and what 're you gonna do?
Stop, I won't let you get away!
Next time:"ldentify Yourself: Powerful New Rivals"
As for me, I'm gonna kick butt again!Press down hard on the gas
That's right, there's no compromise
We'll slip through the night
At the final moment push hard
That's right, all the way to zero,
Until we wipe away the days
Gently open your heart
If you pull it close to you
It will reach you, without a doubt
It will come, closer
Now
We're speeding through life,squeezing it for all of its worth
Our feet are tied
But we still keep going farther
Even if I take it back, and grasp it
If you're not the one
There will be no meaning
And so we'll go far off into the distance.

Tenten vs. Temari
The fifth battle...
Tenten, Temari... come forward!
Seeing that made me all fired up, too!
Now... The second one fromthe Land of Sand, huh...
Do your best!
- Tenten!- It looks like it's going to be interesting.
Begin!
Killer Kunoichi and a Shaky Shikamaru
Go for it, Tenten!
Believe in your own strength, Tenten!
We're behind you, Tenten!
Knock her with all your strength!
That's good!
Cheer her on more, more,more with passion, Lee!
Yeah!
These guys are noisy!
That spacing is just what I'd expectfrom Tenten,
not too close, not too far.
Attacks or defense,she can respond to either one.
What happened?
Please begin.
Are you planning to wait out andsee how I make my move?
Let me just tell you,
once I start my attackyou'll be over in a second.
You're trying to be cool andsee what I do first...
A hundred years too early!
It doesn't matter to me, come first.
You said it...
Well, I won't hold back.
They missed?
That's impossible!
What happened?Is that a warm-up?
Or are you scared and your aim is off?
I thought I would enjoy ita little bit more,
but evidently it's not promising.
No way!
I can't believe Tenten's attack missed!
It's unbelievable indeed.
Tenten's weapons...
always hits the markten out of ten times.
There no reason for them to miss.
That's right...She didn't miss.
She was made to miss.
As always, she's being disagreeable.
How foolish...
How disgraceful!
Huh?
Sand wins again.
We don't know that yet.
We know.
How?How do we know?
Explain it so I understand!
Stupid... As if I'd dosuch a bothersome thing.
Shikamaru said it so,surely that's how it is.
These guys are hard to understand.
Calm down...
Don't let her get to you...
One.
Two.
Three...
If it's gonna get dodged,
I just have to makeit impossible to!
So she's measuring the spacing,next one is going to be the big attack.
I get it...
So, that fan is the secret.
If so...
How about...this?!
No way!
My flying weapons!
Is there a secret mechanismin the fan...?
This is...
the first star.
There are two more.
When the third star appears,
you will lose.
Tenten!
Don't be taken in byyour opponent, be calm!
Be calm!
I know...
Lee, I really intended to usethis in the main battle,
not the preliminary round--
but it looks like I can't do it that way.
She's already going to use it?
Pulling out two scrolls?
What does she intend to do?
Hah! No matter what you do,it won't work.
Rising Twin Dragons!
Even if you increase the amount,it's still the same!
Second star!
I'm not done yet!
Did I do it?
Third star.
She disappeared!
Where is she?
I'm over here!
Darn--!
Ninja Art!
Wind Scythe Jutsu!
Tenten!
Chakra is enfolded in that wind.
Huh?!
Tenten fought well...
But she won't be able to escape fromthat twister.
T-That's awful.
Tenten...!
How boring... really.
To think she completely interceptedTenten's weapon attacks.
This is ridiculous!
What's going on with her...?
It's just like Shikamaru said,it's the Sand's win.
That's why I said it.
There's no reason for us to lose here.
The Land of Sand is to be feared...
Temari wins the fifth battle.
Oh no!
Nice catch.
What are you doing?!
Is that something you do toan opponent who fought to the utmost?!
You're annoying!
Take that trash away already!
Stop! Lee!
Leaf Hurricane!
What?!
You're just like you look...
You're dull too.
What did you say?!
Stop! Lee!
Guy Sensei!
Temari.
Come up quick, you've beendeclared the winner.
Don't keep company with that awful-lookingguy and his chaperone forever.
What...?!
That's enough, Lee.
Gentlemen of Sand...
I wonder if I may give youa word of warning.
This kid is strong.
You should prepare yourselves.
Picking a fight with the Sand...
I absolutely wouldn't want todo it with those guys.
T-They're all awesome guys...
Don't lose to those guys!
Naruto!
S-Sakura.
Sakura... Are you okay already?
Never mind that,you should worry about yourself!
Huh? Me? I don't havean injury or anything.
That's not what I mean.
If you lose here, it's a point of dishonor.
You'd be ashamed to face Sasuke!
Y- Yeah.
And...
Thanks for earlier...
No!
Sakura!
You did your hardestto get here!
You'll disgrace women ifyou lose to that Sasuke-obsessed girl!
If it weren't for your stupid cheeringat that time...
I would have been soundlybeaten by Ino.
Yeah, that's right.
Y-You!
Okay, hurry hurry!Me next!
Next!ext is my turn!
Shikamaru Nara vs. Tsuchi Kin
Darn!
It's me.
Shikamaru, don't lose!
- Show us that you're a real man!- All right, all right.
Get her with the 1 6 combo, go!
- Win Shikamaru!- Ino’s become super energetic.
You go for it!
That guy manipulates shadows.
Be careful of the shadows...
I won't be beaten bya stupid technique like that.
Shikamaru!
Bash that one around!And while you're at it...
Man, what a pain.
Furthermore, my opponent is a woman...It's hard to get to it.
If that's what you think,I'll end this quickly.
Go, go! Shikamaru!
Well, you could say thatI know these guys' raw power
from that incident from the second test...
I don't know anything about this one's Jutsu.
On top of that, she's seen my Jutsu...
- The sixth battle.- That being said, for me...
Shikamaru versus Kin!
Begin!
I can only do this.
One trick pony, huh...?
Shut up!
Ninja Art, Shadow Possession Jutsu!
That Jutsu!
It's nothing if I just pay attentionto the movement of your shadow!
Bells...?
Heh, that's a classic.
Next, you'll throw Senbons with bells
and Senbons without bellsat the same time, right?
I'll respond to the sound of the bells,intending to dodge them.
But I won't notice the quiet Senbons,and, ouch.
Is that right?
You're a chatty guy!
So in order to not get caughtby the shadow Senbons...
I'm alert to the trickand look closely...
What?!
Behind?!
String?
Darn it!
Too late!
Shikamaru!
He took that pretty bad.
It wasn't that bad, look closely.
Huh?
F-For the moment I dodged a fatal hit.
Now it's my turn!
That's not going to happen.
W-What's this?
That happens to anyonewho hears my bell.
The sound vibration ofthis special bell
reaches the brain directlyfrom the ear drum.
And then it will make you hallucinate.
It's useless!
You can't avoid the sound ofmy bell by doing...
that...that...that...that...that...
Shoot! Which one?Which is the real one?
You can't do anything, can you?
Your shadow, which was your faint hope,doesn't even know where to stretch to...
Well... I'll cook you slowly.
Taking me lightly...!
This time it's five,next time seven...
I'll continue until you becomea hedgehog.
Y-You're lying, you brat!
Huh?!
You'd end it soon...
That's what you saidin the beginning, isn't it?
I see, you can't endure the painand want to be eased.
Well, I'll finish it here.
It's your death warrant.
W-What?!
M-My body...
At last, Shadow Possession Jutsuis a success.
W-What are you saying?
No way!Your shadow isn't anywhere...
You don't realize it yet?
I-It can't be...
It's just that, you fool!
A thread at this heightcan't have a shadow.
I can stretch and shrinkmy own shadow.
The shadow is gradually getting thicker.
This wasn't the shadow of the thread...
That's right. I stretched my shadowand made it narrow,
so it looked like the shadow ofa thread and stuck it on you.
But... How do you win with that?
I'm just gonna movethe same way as you.
Annoying.
Be quiet and watch.
Stupid!
If you continue like this and attack...
You, too,will be wounded!
I know that.
No way! You're...!
We're gonna throw shurikenat each other.
How far will we go...?
Fool, stop it!
You're only talk...
And that one's a goner.
If you're a shinobi,
you have to grasp the situationand the layout when you battle.
Even though we madethe same movements...
the distance of the walls behindeach of us was different.
I just used the shuriken and
called attention awayfrom the wall behind us.
Winner! Shikamaru Nara.
Good job Shikamaru!
Cool!
Me next...
Me next... Me next...!
That guy's dull and plain,but that was kinda cool.
Shoot!
I'm the only one left.
And the next match.
The people left are one Sound ninja,
me, Hinata, Naruto, Choji, Neji and Lee.
And that Sand guy...
Just please spare me from that guy.
This year's rookie looks quite challenging...
Naruto Uzumaki vs. Kiba Inuzuka
It's here, it's here, it's here!
What we've been waiting for!
It's finally my turn!
Yeah! Lucky us!
If it's this guywe'll absolutely win, Akamaru!
Yahoo!
- If I'm not next, Sakura will despise me...- I'm gonna do it!
- and call me Bushy Brow.- I'm gonna go for it!
- If I'm not next. Sakura will...- Just watch me! Yay!
This Lee kid, he's just likeGuy was in the past...
Do your best, Naruto.
Leave it to me.
Well Naruto, show us...
how much you've grown.
I'm going to do it!
Hey, can you hear it?
The clear, blue sky goes on and on
The ocean spans limitlessly
Please keep that smile on your face forever
Or else I'll cry
You won't have to search around you
It's all ok now.
Everyone is insidethis hand
when you want to cry,and you want to run away
When you forget what happiness is
Just sing.
Light is born, and darkness was born
The two are one
Harmonia, feel the telepathy
Hey, can you hear it?
Darn that Kiba!
I hold back a little bit andhe rides my brain.
Yap, yap, yap, yap,it's annoying! Believe it!
Just quit talking tough, and use your dogor whatever, and come at me!
I don't know what kind oftraining you've done,
but I'm the man who's goingto become Hokage.
You're the one who's goingto get his butt kicked.
Next time: "Akamaru Unleashed!Who's Top Dog Now?"
Don't take me lightly!Yeah, turn your sadness into kindness, your uniqueness into strength
Even if you get lost, let's start walking
One more time
Are you really happy
when you're always meeting to someone's expectations?
Even if you change to who you really wanna be
Will you always have a great smile?
Dreaming of only "the beginning," I wake up
and someday, I'll live on my own.
Yes, precious things are never in shape
You never know what it is when you get it or lose it
Yeah, turn your sadness into kindness, your uniqueness into strength
Even if you get lost, let's start walking
One more time

Sensei!Please stop this match right away!
There's nothing to worry about...
What?
Sasuke and l...
We didn't just get here latefor no reason.
Late for the Show, But Ready to Go!The Ultimate Secret Technique is Born!
The third eye...
There is no doubt... That Jutsu is...!
Darn... Gaara...
Tora, Saru, Ne, Tatsu, Tori,Inu, Ne...

Tora, Ushi, Ne, Tora, Tatsu...

Tatsu, Tora, Hitsuji, Saru, Tori...
As I thought, it's no good.
I, Hitsuji, Uma, Tatsu, Tatsu,Tatsu, Ushi, Ne...
Inu, l, Tori, Saru, Hitsuji, Uma...
Withdrawing like that...
I don't know what you're up to...
but the timing is perfect.
This thing of mine also takes time!
Hey, is something the matter?
No...
It must be my imagination...
Hurry up!
Sensei...
Hm?
What did you mean when you saidthat you didn't get here late for nothing?
Hmm...
You want to know why?
Like I said, this isn't the timeto be talking about that!
Shut up and watch him.
'Cause you'll get a real surprise.
That idiot...
Gaara...we never know whenthe signal is going to come!
Yeah...I'm gonna tear him open.
That's how it comes out.What?
The contents...
Lots and lots are coming out, right?
I'll give it all to you.
I'm always a good boy!
Yeah, let's do it.
Mother, I'm watching so...
Darn! He's totally useless,no matter what we do now.
He's not evenabiding by the plan.
He looks like he's just goingto screw things up!
That Gaara!
Hey, hey, wouldn't itbe better if we flee...?
Plan...?
How's it going?
All preparations are proceedingin accordance with the timeline.
Please hurry up with preparationfor Summoning.
I want to be sure we're able tomake our move at any time.
Understood!
All right, I'll leave that to you.
D-Don't tell me that...
The reason I decided totrain Sasuke was...
because he was like me.
A physical Activation?!
I see...
That's why he went throughthe physical training
and increased his speed significantly...!
That's right!
Awesome...
The Chakra is clearly visibleto the naked eye...
What in the world is happening?!
Don't tell me thathe learned that Jutsu...!
So this is the Uchiha Clan...
Exactly...
W-What the heck is that?!
What a sound!What's that technique?
That's just a jab...
Huh?!
However, it is the one used byLeaf Village's number one technician.
That's the only original techniqueof the Copy Ninja, Kakashi...
It's the special technique usedonly for assassinations...
Its secret is in the speed of the jab,
and also the physical aptitudethat gives forth a gigantic Chakra,
the ability of the Chakra tofocus solely on the target,
and moreover the speed ofthe jab makes a "chichichichichi" sound...
A unique sound attack similarto the rumbling of a thousand birds.
And that's why that technique is called...
Chidori: One Thousand Birds!
No way!That Gaara's absolute protection is...
It's impossible...
Don't tell me...
Excellent work...
That's...
Kakashi's...
Chidori...Also known as Lightning Blade.
Lightning Blade?
Lightning Blade is another namefor the Jutsu derived
from Kakashi's ability to cut throughlightning using that technique.
Huh? Cut through lightning?
Huh? That sounds fishy...
A-Awesome...
The real name of that techniqueis Chidori...
The secret is the speed of his jabthat surpasses any human limitations
and the intensity ofthe Chakra on his arm...
And that arm turns virtuallyinto the equivalent of the swing
of a celebrated sword thatcuts through everything.
But what a reckless technique...
That's not for you to say...
Right, Lee?
It's beyond my scope ofcomprehension, but...
What an awesome technique!
I can understand it...
If it were me, if I madea running start at that speed,
I wouldn't make a direct jab attackon the opponent...
Or rather, I couldn't.
For an opponent,
a straight line attack just gives himan easy chance to launch a counterblow.
And moreover, I don't have the eyesto read that counterblow.
I envy you...Sasuke!
When I fought you once, I said...
Even if one understands visually,
it's meaningless unlessone can move physically...
I was filled witha feeling of superiority.
But now, you have a body that movesat the same high speed as mine.
Moreover, you have...
the Sharingan!
I caught you!
Third Squadron.We are ready any time.
All preparations are completeon this end too.
Roger. Proceed with actionat the signal.
Looks like it's almost time.
The guy who was worrying aboutSasuke until just a moment ago...
is now jealous of him.
Sasuke...
This is the feeling!
Summoning Jutsu!
I've gotten stronger...
In order to become Hokage...
In order not to lose to anyone...
Sasuke!
In order not to lose to you.
I want...to fight you, too.
But you are...
Yeah...
What...? This warm thing...?
Mother...? What is...?
Blood... my blood is...!
D-Don't tell me that...
D-Don't tell me thatGaara is hurt?!
What is it?!
It's that thing's arm!
Darn! Doing somethingcareless like that...
Has the Perfect Possession happened?
I don't know.He seems to be injured...
This has never happened before.
It gives me the chillsjust to remember...
When I first saw that thing,I wasn't able to eat...
I mean, visually it's totally...
What is...
this sensation?
He's hurt, after all...
The shell was broken whenhis body was incomplete!
It's different! Those aren't the eyes!
W-What was that...that look earlier on?!
Huh...?
What's this...? I can't see...
Kakashi! This must be!
Yeah... a Genjutsu!
- Release!- Release!
What's going on...?
Release!
Genjutsu!Is Kabuto already moving?
In that case, it's just about time...
It's coming!
Shall we begin?!
It's the signal!
- Start the operation!- Start the operation!
Everyone makes mistakesIt's nothing to be ashamed about

Forge on strong
It got dark all of a sudden...it feels so good.
I hear something in the distance.
Sakura's voice, Kakashi Sensei's voice...
Scream? I just heard something loud.
I think I do, but...Sasuke...
I got to watch his match!
But I really don't knowwhat's going on.
Next time: "Zero Hour!The Destruction ofthe Hidden Leaf Village Begins!"

This man Jiraiya does not fall victimto any woman's allurement,
but rather his forte iswinning women's affections!
You were totally excited by a lame tacticlike a woman winking at you!
You shouldn't be the one to tryacting all suave and cool, you Pervy Sage!
Like I said, don't call methat in front of people...
Be quiet...
More importantly these peoplearen't normal, Pervy Sage!
Didja hear me, Pervy Sage?!
Like I said, don't call me "Pervy Sage"!
You are, after all, Master Jiraiya,one of the legendary Sannin...
I didn't believe thatI'd be able to stop you so easily
despite the fact that you area huge womanizer.
What?!
You know the true identityof Pervy Sage?!
Well no, that's not necessarilywho I really am...
Seems like you released the Genjutsuthat we had put on that woman.
You shouldn't call yourself a manfor using such a cowardly tactic
like casting a Genjutsu on the womanwith your hypnotic eyes
to separate me and Naruto.
Separate us...Why would they do that?
Your target is Naruto, after all.
You are after the Nine-Tailed Foxin Naruto...
No wonder Kakashi knew that as well...
I see clearly now.The information source was you.
To abduct Naruto is the No. 1 priorityplaced by our organization, Akatsuki!
What's going on...?
I can't let you have Naruto...
I wonder about that.
This is perfect...I'll get rid of you two right here!
Don't butt in...
The one that's going to kill him is...
Me!
Hate Among the Uchihas:The Last of the Clan
Sasuke...
Revenge, I see...
Right now, I have no interest in you...
Don't mess with me!
Sasuke!
Darn you!
Naruto! I told you not to butt in!
I told you before...
I've lived only for this very day...for this very day!
Sasuke...
Not yet...
You can't even make a hand signtogether at this point...
This is... my battle!
Fine.
Wha--?
You heard that didn't you?
This is their battle.Let's not bother with it.
Fine then!
Wh-Why...?
Our power difference hasn't changedat all since that time...
Why is that?
He doesn't show any mercy.
What have l...been doing all this time?
Whatever have l...
You are weak.
And you are weak...
because you don't have enough hate.
This place is...
This place is...Could it be?!
That's right.
This is our house.
Dad! Mom!
You are weak.
For the next 24 hours...
Stop it...
Relive that day.
Stop it!
Uncle! Auntie!
You're not even worth killing.Foolish younger brother...
If you want to kill me, begrudge me!Hate me!
And keep on surviving in thatunsightly manner...
Just continue fleeing and fleeingand hang onto your life!
Hasn't changed at all...
Using Tsukiyomi: Nightmare Realmon your own little brother.
Stop it already! You!
Wha--?!
Th-This...
Ninja Art: Toad Mouth Trap!
How unfortunate, Itachi, Kisame.
You guys are already insidemy stomach!
I summoned the esophagus ofthe giant toad
of the Mt. Myomoku rock cave.
You guys are wanted criminals anyway.
I'll turn you guys into fodderfor the stone toad.
What?!
Wh-What is this?
Naruto, you stay still!
Don't worry, it's my Jutsu!
Come here, Kisame!
Oh!
Darn it!
It's useless!
There hasn't been one person whohas been able to escape from this!
A wall of flesh is charging at us!
The wall is faster.
At this rate...
Hey...
Pervy Sage!
What's the matter?!
Huh!
They've gone!
I cannot believe that this wallhas been torn through...
Why must we retreat?You would be...
We have no reason to rush toget Naruto in the current condition.
Besides, I have to restmy body somewhere for a while.
Not just Tsukuyomi,
but he also made meuse Amaterasu as well...
What is this fire?
It's black...
Don't get so close!
How did those guys manage to get out?
Not only that...
What are these black flames?
The stone toad who has the abilityto blow fire had its intestine's burned...
Huh...?
All right!
Sealing Jutsu: Fire Seal!
All right! It'll be okay for now.
Now for Sasuke!
Sasuke!
Sasuke...
Dynamic...
Guy?!
Entry!
Well... Eh...
I'm sorry to have kicked you so directly.
I was in a rush and I forgot my mirror...
I used this headband instead,but it was hard to see.
And I assumed this rough-hewn facewas the enemy...
I just let the flames ofthe burning juvenescence take over me...
I'm sorry!
Is that... supposed to be an apology?
I'm a simple-minded guyjust like how my face looks.
It doesn't really matter.
More importantly, we have to get Sasuketo the Medical Team!
Yes!
He's broken his arm and ribs.
Not only that, he's lost consciousness
from some kind of mental blowhe received from the Visual Jutsu!
This boy also experienced that Jutsu...
Hey Pervy Sage!Is Sasuke going to be all right?
Seems like he's receiveda significant amount of mental damage.
I'm going to kill you!
Die!
You jerk!
You're in the way!
Darn... Why?!
What did that guy do to Sasuke?!
Hey, Pervy Sage!
We've gotta change our plan!
I got scared earlier,
but this time I'm going to chasethose black-capes and get them!
It's me that they want, right?!
Then, I'll be the one tomake my way over!
Humph, you're only going to be killedif you go now.
They're at a totally different levelfrom you.
I just managed to get youaway from them...
Then, are we just goingto keep running away?!
Are we supposed to keep living in fear?!
Shut your mouth for a second!
You are weak.
I'm sorry, Guy.
I thought that I had sparedthe boy's feeling, but...
I should have saved him much sooner.
Kakashi has also come downwith the same Jutsu...
We don't know whenhe will regain consciousness.
Kakashi Sensei?!
When my students are hurt...
I always wish,from the bottom of my heart...
If that person,who is a medical specialist, were here...
That's why we're going togo find her now.
What?
You mean, her?
Could it be...?
W-Wait...!
C-Could this money be...?!
Yup, that's right...
The one who uses the slugand drives illness away,
and who is alsoone of the Sannin like me...
All right! We're going to turn aroundour luck with this!
Princess Tsunade withthe letter "Gamble" on her back!
A cycle of hardship, right?
Inside, we were crying, right?
But the one thing we won't give upis the dream we've chosen, right?
It's a secondary role,
a role in the shadows
But in reaching for that dream,
let us stay centered,let us stay true
Over and over,we hung on without giving up
Over and over,we kept coming back up
Over and over,we believed and dreamed
Over and over,we've seen fools
Over and over,we've stood in the shadows of others
Now, it's our turn...Let us bask in our dreams
It's festival, festival,festival!
I'm going to spend likethere's no tomorrow!
Wait a minute, Naruto!I will keep your wallet for you.
Huh?!
It's been said since ages pastthat three forbidden factors:
money, alcohol, and women,are believed to cause Ninja failures.
I am not like you, Pervy Sage!
All right! I am going toenjoy the festival!
Next time: "A New Training Begins:I Will Be Strong!"
Wait. What are we gonnado about my training?Yeah, turn your sadness into kindness, your uniqueness into strength
Even if you get lost, let's start walking
One more time
Are you really happy
when you're always meeting to someone's expectations?
Even if you change to who you really wanna be
Will you always have a great smile?
Dreaming of only "the beginning," I wake up
and someday, I'll live on my own.
Yes, precious things are never in shape
You never know what it is when you get it or lose it
Yeah, turn your sadness into kindness, your uniqueness into strength
Even if you get lost, let's start walking

That darn Naruto...
Zero Motivation:The Guy with Cloud Envy!
- C'mon!- Hurry up with the match!
Finish it up already!
Stand up and start the match!
Evidently, people don't want tosee the minor players' matches
since they were really lookingforward to Sasuke's match...
If people aren't expecting anythingexciting from this battle,
makes no sensefor me to have it.
What? You're giving up, too?
My opponent's a girl again?
Hey, why aren't you moving?!
C'mon, get started!
That kid has had zero fighting spiritfrom the beginning...
C'mon! What is he doing?!
C'mon Shikamaru!Get it together and do it!
If you don't come, I'll go!
Hey! Haven't started yet...
Man, that girl is so gung-ho.
It doesn't really matter ifI become a Chunin or not.
But there's no reason whya man should lose to a woman.
Well... let's do it!
This guy's quick to run away...
Nor any reason why a man shouldrough up a woman.
But I don't want to beroughed up either.
He's the kind of Ninja thatuses shadows.
Shadow Possession Jutsu.
He's probably trying to lure me intothe trees where there're lots of shadows...
but I won't let him.
Why am I the only one who alwaysgets a woman for an opponent, cripes?!
Shikamaru! You get her witha torrent of 1 6 combination...!
Mind if I sit here?
Huh?
What... you?Your stomach okay?
What? Wasn't Sasuke's match next?
Shh!
Everything's fine, right, Sakura?After all, it's Sasuke, right?
R-Right now, I should leave her alone.
It looks like Shikamaru taking partin this final battle,
it seems like he's in the wrong place.
Don't say that!
I certainly don't think thathe has any great techniques,
but that Shikamaru isalways good at strategizing.
That's why I feel like we ended upin the preliminary round the other day.
Hmm, yeah well...
And after all, he jumped downinto the arena himself.
He seems uncharacteristically driven.
Even he can be passionateonce in a while!
Go! Shikamaru!
Geez, I envy a cloud being so free...
I guess I pretty mucham completely without desire...
Even the reason why I became a Ninja...
was because I thoughtI would have a fun life, ya know...
Get it together!
C'mon Shikamaru!
But...of course, it's not that easy.
What's going on with that stupid face?!Is he underestimating me?
Ninja Art: Wind Scythe Jutsu!
That's right, with this attack,my armed attacks also were beaten down.
I see...
Shadow Possession Jutsu!I've seen that true identity!
Evidently there's a limit tothe stretching and shortening,
changing shape of the shadow...
No matter how much youchange the shape of the shadow,
even when you stretch it,
it can only span up tothe size of your own shadow.
That's right isn't it?
You got it...
Even if I assume that he's made upthe distance,
by stretching his shadow from the edgeof the shadow of the arena wall...
This is the limit to how farthe shadow can stretch.
This is the scope of his attack!
1 5 meters, 32 centimeters!
She took the distancewith the folding fan.
Temari is stronger at long distancebattles than she is at close range...
the outcome has already been decided.
What? What is that sign...?
That's no sign. That's like, his habit.
Habit...?
He enjoys passing time slowly.That guy's like an old man.
That's why he likesJapanese checkers and chess
and always makes me be his opponent.
When he's stuck on a move,he always does that.
Why?
He's working out his strategy.
And, I've never beaten him.
A strategy...but this is an actual fight.
It's different from a game.
But it's said that formation piecesthat were used to build battle strategy
eventually becomegame pieces.
Shikamaru is like a brilliant general.
Wait a minute.
When we grouped the Genin,I saw his scores.
They were at about thesame level of that Naruto's.
He said that moving his pencil duringwritten exams at the academy is a pain,
and during the tests,he always sleeps instead.
A pain...?
He was so good at strategy games,I felt something wasn't right...
so I had him take an IQ testunder the pretense that it was a game.
And... how did it turn out?......
He was more than brilliant.
With an IQ of over 200,he's a super genius!
T-Two hundred?!
He's done thinking...It starts now.
Looks like you've got somefighting spirit now...
It's pointless to hide!
I wonder if he's really got a strategy...
M-Maybe...
With that he has no approach!
Shikamaru! Go for it!
It's pointless, isn't it?
He'll give up soon.
He hates thingsthat are a pain in the butt.
You're wrong!At least, I hope so...
But you may be right...
How long are you going to run away!Cut it out!
It's no use.
As long as I'm on theoutside of this line,
he absolutely can't catch me...
No, wait! Close call!
You caught on well.
So you were dragging your feetto wait for the sun to set...
in order to make the surfaceof your own shadow larger
by stretching the shadow line of the wall.
As the sun goes down,the shadows lengthen.
Isn't that so?
That was close! Shikamaru...
But why is he using shadows?
After all, Shikamaru is insidethe shadow of the field.
If there's even a little bit of light,he can make a shadow within a shadow!
You don't know a thingabout Shikamaru!
A shadow... in a shadow...?
Even if I calculate the heightof the sun now
and the limit to the distanceof the previous attack,
there's no mistaking the distance!
Temari! Up!
I see.
What's this?!
Darn it!
I won't let you escape!
I didn't expect that he wouldcreate extra shadows to reach me
by making a parachute with his jacket...!
He's impressive.
Once I notice the parachute from above,I'll take my attention off from my feet.
That's a sneaky trick to catch meoff my guard!
However, now it's clear.
Shadow Possession Jutsu is
one in which other shadows are usedto get your opponent,
a skillful technique!
She's dodged this trick too...
Not careful enough in the final stage.
And his opponent is fairly analytical.
She's good at thinking ahead.
If this battle takes too long,
the shadows in the arena will grow,and his territory will increase.
I'll defeat him with the next one!
Should I make a diversionwith Clone Jutsu...?
Now his shadow is...
Okay!
Clone...
N-No way...!
My...body is...?!
At last...Shadow Possession Jutsu is a success!
What?!
What's going on...?
That boy...
How much is he planning ahead...?
That's Shikamaru's skill.
Why...won't my body move?!
The shadow shouldn'thave reached this far.
I'll let you take a look behind you...
T-This hole...!
You saw it too, didn't you...?
That hole is the hole Narutoburrowed and flew out of.
So it's connected to thebig hole in front of you.
I didn't expect that...a shadow in a tunnel of a hole...
Right.
Pure and simple,a calculated chess move.
So his purpose to make Temari measurethe limit of the shadow several times
was to lead her to his final trickof using this hole.
Temari battled on the outsideof the limit of the shadow
that she measured and followed,
but he caught her from behind,trailed by the shadow she couldn't see...
There is no escape from this.
I-It can't be...
The attack that he usedwith the jacket,
was it a device to lead meto right this spot...?
Was that an underplot too?!
Why that--?!
Checkmate with the next one.
My body is moving on its own!I can't resist it!
Before anyone knew it,they fell under the spell of this match.
That guy with no markis quite a dark horse.
Yes! You did it!
Go! Shikamaru!
Check...
Good grief... I give up!
What?!
See I told you... he'd give up.
Ino doesn't know anythingabout Shikamaru.
W-What did you say?!
I've used too much Chakra from ShadowPossession Jutsu in rapid succession.
I can't hold it another 10 seconds.
I thought of the next trick 200 times.
But I'm out of time...
This has become such a pain.
Doing one match is good...
That guy is a strange one.
The winner is Temari!
One! First, Tyson jumps and slamdunks

Wow, this is the largest cheerfrom the audience ever!
Of course. The featured battleof this final tournament is about to begin.
Hate to admit it,but I'm looking forward to it myself.
Hey, Shikamaru.I can't hear what you said.
There's not a single person who'snot excited about the featured battle.
Next: "Dancing Leaf, Squirming Sand"
I can't take my eyesaway from this battle!Connecting old words that have been used up
I just want to convey my simple thoughts
That day's faint wind blows away
at the castle ruins of yesterday
I'll laugh with you and live for the moment
Still that incident will continue to trouble you, right?
That's why it must be good-bye
Leaving nothing behind, let us share what is left
In time, we'll realize that it was everything
And sadness will touch our cheeks, creating a river of tears
Trembling thoughts swept into a vortex and melting away

This is not good,looks like a storm is coming.
What?
Idate...
Run Idate Run!agi lsland Awaits!
Aoi... Rokusho!
I thought you had run away.
Wasn't running awayyour specialty?
Shut up!
I'm different from you!
No, you are the same kindof human as I am.
A betrayer who doesn't trust others.
Betraying your own brother,walking away from the village,
and capable of thinking only of yourself.The worst kind of man.
Such a man...doesn't deserve to live!
Die!
Sakura, is your wound okay?
Uh-huh.
A wound like this is nothing.
But...
Those Rain Ninja... huh?
Yes.
Hah, they're nothing!
No, it's not that!If they're headed towards Idate...
Oh! Idate is in danger!
That's what I've been saying!
Hey, Naruto!This is no time to be playing around.
No!
They're here now.
Naruto!
Lucky us!
We are invincible in water.
Geez, what a troublesome guy.
They've now fallen into our trap.
Water Clone Jutsu!
Sakura!
Shadow Clone Jutsu!
How stupid. What use canShadow Clones have in this situation?
There's no way they can defeatour Water Clones in water.
Even if you try to trick us,
I'm hanging on to the real bodyright here.
What are they trying to do?
N-No way!
What a whirlpool...Chakra is intertwined in it!
Naruto...you...
This is the applicationof the first step
in my training forthe Rasengan!
Sakura!
Sakura, hang in there!
Sakura! Just hang in there!
Come on! Sakura!
Sakura!
Pull yourself together! Sakura!
I-I guess...I've got...to...do it...
S-Sasuke....
I'd like it if Sasuke is the one to do...
the CPR...
S-Sakura...
What the hell are you doing, idiot!
Sasuke?
We don't have any time to spare.We need to meet up with Idate.
Wait, Sasuke.
Hey... Don't leave me.
It's about time...
Fukusuke reaches Modoroki Shrine.
There's no chance for youto win now.
You can't even runor stand up now.
When that pain spreadsthroughout your whole body,
you'll reach a different finish line.
The finish line of death.
What are you thinking of doingwith that dirty knife?
Don't touch it!
Looks like you still don't understandyour situation.
All you have to do is run away.
You have no right to eventhe slightest bit of integrity.
Boss...
I'm sorry...
Boss...
I couldn't keep...
the promise I made with you.
Idate!
You bastard!
Darn, what a downpour.
Are you the boss of the Rain Ninja?!
Looks like it was too harda task for them.
Even if they werethe same Genin as you,
seems like the Hidden Leaf onesare better.
This is terrible...
But can Genin-level Ninjafight against me?
Shut up!
Above!
Humph... So that's your level, after all.
I'll use the same methodI used on Idate,
and send you to hell.
No need to waste my Chakra.
Sakura!
Th-These darned things...
Those are poisoned needles speciallymade by the Hidden Rain Village.
They will send you to hellin a few minutes,
no matter how strong you are.
Don't you look down on us! Bastard--!
Looks like Fukusuke has reachedModoroki Shrine.
Die gasping.
It's a deaththat fits you Genin brats well.
Is Wagarashi winning this one too?
Isn't there a God or Buddhain this world?
I miss the old times whenJirocho was in charge.
Terrible, terrible, I'm drenched.
You are amazing, Fukusuke.
Keep on running to the goal,and make our Boss Wagarashi happy.
Watch it, you scum.
Who do you think you are talking to?
What?
My victory is already assured.Let me relax for a while.
Bastard, think you're so hot?!
Cut it out...
Brother...
What if something goes wrongduring the race?
Who knows what our bosswill do to us.
All right.
Just wait and see.
Darn, that bastard!
Naruto, Sasuke...
Take this.
Sakura... What's that?
Before leaving the Leaf Village,
Lady Tsunade handed this to me.
Take this with you.I am sure it will come in handy.
Old Lady Tsunade?
I think he'll recoverconsciousness now.
Sasuke and Naruto,you take this, too.
O-Okay.
Also, we'll be too cold here,so we need to move somewhere else.
Brother!
Look! I've finally becomea Ninja, too!
I see...
I've got to become the bestin everything!
I'll train hard,and complete lots of missions.
And I'll become a Chunin super fast.
Then after that, a Jonin.
I'm going to be like you, Brother!
I'm Idate, the Swift Runnermaking headway in life.
Brother?
Listen Idate...
In the world of Shinobi,
there is something more importantthan success or power.
Something more important?
Until you understand that,it's too early for you to talk that way.
Oh!
He's conscious now.
Are you okay?
What happened to Aoi?!
He disappeared...
So that Rain Ninja is called Aoi?
Idate, do you know him?
He...
was a teacher whenI was in the Leaf Village.
You...are from the Leaf Village?
Aoi... betrayed the Leaf Village
and became a Jonin of the Hidden Rain.
What the hell do you mean?
Not yet.
You have to rest a little more.
How is your hand there?
That hand...
You kept it clenched all this time.
Darn! I'd come all this way,and yet l...!
It's too early to give up!
And you tell us that you were oncea Shinobi of the Leaf?!
I forgot all about the Leaf...
the momentI walked away from the village.
You walked away from the village?
I was depressed after failingthe first test of the Chunin Exam.
That was close, Idate...
Don't take it so hard.
There are ways to becomea Chunin other than the Chunin Exam.
Really?!
Yes, really.
Just do as I tell you.
Okay!
Aoi Sensei...
Idate...
Aoi Sensei,I'd brought them as you told me to.
All right.
These are indeed the Scroll of Sealingand the legendary blade,
the Blade of the Thunder God, believed tohave been used by the Second Hokage.
Well done, Idate.
Now I can become a Chunin, right?
Sure you can...
in the Village Hidden in the Rain.
You are leavingthe Leaf together with me,
taking these as gifts to them.
But...
Of course.
There's no way you can get away withstealing the village's treasures.
You tricked me!
To survive in this world,you must not believe in others...
Remember that.
Well, what are you going to do, Idate?
Either way, you are alreadya Rogue Ninja.
You'll be chained in jail for life,if you are lucky.
You'll be chained in jail for life,if you are lucky.
Ever since then,I haven't returned to the village.
I am an irresponsible manwho can't do a single thing right.
But Boss Jirocho believed in me.
Even though I'd neverbeen of any use to him.
Boss Jirocho had faith in me!
And yet, l...!
He's...
He's...like the old me...
No one will ever accept you!Die Naruto!
Duck down, Naruto!
I'm... a worthless guy...
W-Why?
Because we are the same.
He's like me of the old days.
I go around and around,and get nowhere...
I can't do anything right.
Aoi is right.
I have... no right to live--
You idiot!
There's a personwho still trusts you, right?
I know, Naruto.
You felt alone...and you were suffering!
One is enough!
The race isn't over yet!
You never know how things will turn outunless you try until the very end.
But...
Stand up now!
Naruto, it's not possible!Idate's body is still...
If he can't run,then I'll carry him on my back and run!
The opponent must already bein Modoroki Shrine...
Don't give up!
Hey... Naruto...
Sasuke...
Let's leave it to Naruto here.
Jirocho is waiting for you, right?
Pull yourself together!
Boss, don't you thinkhe actually ran away?
He'll come.
I believe in Idate!
If you run away now,you'll be a loser for your entire life!
For the people who believein you and wait for you...
It's the fastest boat around here.
I'm grateful.
No problem.
Edged tools aren'tfor hurting people...
Show them what you've got!
Naruto! Please take me there!
All right. Leave it to me!
Once in a long while, once in a while
The remnants of a personbroken by dreams

Clinging to the Divine,clinging to Buddha
The remnants of a person crying
Look like a mountain

With a bye-bye rhythm that never ends
Look like a mountain

Hey you!
What're you jabbering about,lecturing like you're something else?!
You are so annoying!
Come on, Idate.
Boss Jirochi is waiting for youat the finish line, right?
I don't care if this guyis a Jonin or whatever.
I'm gonna beat him and make forthe finish line with all my might!

Water Style!
- Water Shark Bomb Jutsu!- Water Shark Bomb Jutsu!
The same Jutsu as me?!
Why have you shown up too?
Well... I asked you to take careof them earlier.
But I kinda felt uneasy, you know.
What business doesa Rogue Ninja like you
have in this village now?
Kakashi Hatake...
Eye to Eye: Sharingan vs. Sharingan
What?! Why?! Why?!
Why do I have to go on a research tripwith you, Pervy Sage?
Oh no, this isn't just any research trip.
There's a woman whose dataI want to collect.
So we have to look for her first.
I really don't have time to accompany youon your perverted research trip!
Because I have training!
Hm? T raining?
I will take lessons from Kakashi Senseiand learn a variety of things, like Chidori!
Kakashi Sensei has beenplaying favorites lately!
Well, I think that techniqueis impossible for you to learn.
More importantly...That woman is really beautiful.
You want to meet her, don't you?!
Not at all.
I'm not some kid who canbe cajoled by you, Pervy Sage!
Anyway, no!
Well, it can't be helped...
Oh, well... I know Jutsu more amazingthan Chidori, but...
It can't be helped...Maybe I'll take Sasuke?
Of course I'll go!
I'll pack my bags right away.
Pervy Sage, don't move!
I'll be darned... He's really a cute kid.
Those eyes are exactly the sameas they used to be in the past.
That being said,he is a true inheritor of the Sharingan...
I have to assume the worst-case scenario,just in case.
This is a surprise...o wonder you copied my Jutsu...
So there really is a fellowbesides Itachi who has that eye.
Your name is Kakashi,the Copy Ninja, wasn't it?
I'm the one who was surprised.
I saw strange men in the tea houseand wondered who they were...
There they were Itachi Uchiha and...
the Mystery Man of Hidden Mist Village,Kisame Hoshigaki.
Well, well... You know even my name.It's an honor.
I see. You're one of the"Seven Ninja Swordsmen of the Mist."
That huge sword is the "Shark Skin," right?
I heard that kid Zabuzahad it out with you?
Yeah...
You are someone who'swell worth lopping off...
Stop it... Kisame.
If you were to go at it with that man,it won't end without cost.
And if you spend too much time,another Shinobi would come running.
However...
Don't lose sight of the goal...You didn't come here to get injured!
Let me hear that "goal" then...?
Just came to find somethingwe're looking for.
Something you're looking for?
The thing you're looking for...What is it?
I'm different from Kisame,I won't take time.
Ninja Art: Water Style.Water wall!
That's some Jutsu speed.My eyes couldn't follow the Sign.
That Shuriken in the right handwas a decoy...
to use a Water Style Jutsu to launchan attack below my foot...
That's what to expect from you, Kakashi.
Your power of analytical eye... is great.
A Shadow Clone?!His Jutsu speed is too fast!
A water clone?!
The Copy Ninja has done well this farwith Jutsu of my village.
Nice! Kakashi!
Get down, Kurenai!
This one is the Shadow Clone...
Huh?
Kakashi! Kurenai!
He made the Shadow Clonebody explode?!
A new Jutsu, a new Jutsu.
Sakura's going to start to like me...
Maybe!
Kakashi Sensei and Sasukewill be surprised!
Kakashi...!
Don't lower your guard...
He's the guy who became a division chiefof Anbu Black Ops at 1 3 years old...
To think he's this powerful...
No, you haven't seenthis guy's strength yet.
I didn't expect that you who are nota member of the Uchiha clan
would have masteredthe Sharingan to that extent...
But your body isn't the "Uchiha clan" bodythat goes with the eye.
That's right. As a result,my stamina doesn't last...
There's a reason why the Uchiha Clanwas deemed the strongest and feared...
I'll demonstrate the true strengthof Sharingan, the Kekkei Genkai!
I-It can't be!
This is bad!
Both of you! Don't look at his eyes!
Both of you! Don't look at his eyes!
Both of you,absolutely do not open your eyes...
It's all over now if your eyes meet.
Only people with Sharingancan have a go with that technique.
Indeed with Sharingan,
you can resist this Mangekyo Sharinganto a certain extent.
However...
this special Visual Jutsu of Sharingan,
Genjutsu: Tsukuyomi, Nightmare Realm,is unbreakable.
The only person who can bring me downis someone
using the same Kekkei Genkai,a Sharingan user...
Sasuke...
I wonder how much you can takewithout the Kekkei Genkai?
The one just now was...Genjutsu?
In the world of Tsukuyomi...
Both space and time...
and mass...I control them all.
For the next 72 hours...
I'll stab you continually with swords.
That's...
In the world of Tsukuyomi...
Both space and time...
and mass...I control them all.
Calm down... This is Genjutsu.
It's best not to be optimisticand think it's an illusion.
This pain is not an illusion.
This pain is absolutelyno different from reality.
How long will your spirit sustain?
There's...71 hours 59 minutes 59 seconds left.
Wha...?!
S-Since then...?!
That's all the time that has passed?!
What happened, Kakashi?!
Are you saying we should keepour eyes closed still?!
N-Not... yet...
What happened?!
Just as that guy finished speaking,you suddenly fell over!
Three days in that world is less thana moment in the actual world, huh...
But...why doesn't he kill me?
He could easily do so, if he wants to...
Whoa...To take that Jutsu without causinghis spirit to collapse.
But Itachi...
it's also dangerous for youto overuse those eyes.
The thing you're looking for...
is it Sasuke?
No...the legacy of the Fourth Hokage...
These guys.What the heck are they planning...?
So, Naruto, is it...?
It's been a long time...
How many years has it beensince you returned to the village?
Kakashi...
I will keep Naruto under my care.
It was an understandable decisionof the Third Hokage
who appointed you tothe role of watching over Naruto...
But even at your level,you may not be able to handle it properly.
What in the world are you saying?
I've been observing Orochimaruever since he left the village...
It was obvious that he would returnto this village sooner or later.
All told, at first I was concernedonly about him, but...
What is it?
The guy joined an organization.
An organization?
What are the details of the organization?
I don't know much of the details,
but it's a small organization knownas Akatsuki made up of nine Shinobi.
Until recently, they weren't makingany dramatic moves
except some cloak-and-dagger activities.
The biggest concern isthe members of that organization.
Almost all of them are listedon the Bingo Book,
all S-rank deviant criminals.
That Itachi is among them.
If the nine of them get together,their intent will not be volunteer activities.
Since you've been told this much,you already know what it means.
But recently, Orochimaru pulled outof the organization.
And at that time,
other members of the organizationwent in to action in different areas,
in pairs gathering Jutsu and things.
Is there proof that one of thosethings is the Nine-Tailed Fox?
It's possible.
Because it's one of the spiritswho possess the strongest Chakra...
Kakashi...
Sooner or later, that Naruto will haveto live watching his back...
That's his destiny.
For now, you should keepyour eyes on Sasuke.
It's necessary for you to teach himhow to use his Sharingan.
I'll take care of Naruto for a while.
The Nine-Tailed Fox inside Narutois your target?
I know that you two aren'tthe only ones on the move...
The name of your organization isAkatsuki, right?
Akatsuki?
Kisame! We'll take Kakashi.Erase the other two.
Severe Leaf Hurricanes!
Who are you?
The Leaf's noble, blue fierce animal...
Mighty Guy!
What a sight...Shouldn't you be called a strange beast?
Don't underestimate that man...
That man is Itachi!
You did this to Kakashi...?
Don't look at Itachi's eyes, Guy!You'll be caught up in his Jutsu!
I know that already!
In order to fight Kakashi,I devised ways to battle the Sharingan.
Open your eyes, both of you!
B-But...
When you battle with the Sharingan,
it's not a problem ifyou don't look at those eyes!
You work around it bygaining insight into his movements
by looking constantly at his feet.
Now that you mention it,you're probably right, but...
You're the only one who can do that.
That's true...
There's a knack to reading
all of your opponents' movementsonly by his feet.
But I can't teach it to youin this emergency.
Just get used it right now!
What should we do?
Kurenai, get Kakashi to the medical team.
Asuma, you are my back-up!
Okay!
And until the reinforcements ofAnbu Black Ops I arranged for arrive,
I will hang out with you guys.
Interesting...That's some nerve...
Kisame... Pull the plug.
We didn't come to have a war.
It's too bad,but no more of this nonsense.
We're leaving.
Too bad... I was finally feeling motivated.
It can't be helped.
All right!
Here I go!
Y-You're putting too much spirit into it.
You're not training on a mountain retreat,you know that, right?
A cycle of hardship, right?
Inside, we were crying, right?
But the one thing we won't give upis the dream we've chosen, right?
It's a secondary role,
a role in the shadows
But in reaching for that dream,
let us stay centered,let us stay true
Over and over,we hung on without giving up
Over and over,we kept coming back up
Over and over,we believed and dreamed
Over and over,we've seen fools
Over and over,we've stood in the shadows of others
Now, it's our turn...Let us bask in our dreams
There's a super beautifulyoung lady over there!
She just winked at us!
Look, Naruto!She must be interested in us!
She may be cuter than Sakura!
- All right, Naruto!- Yeah!
Go back, train,then go to bed.
You always do that to me!
Next time: "Jiraiya:aruto's Potential Disaster!!"
What are we gonna doabout my training?!
C'mon!
Running like a fugitive,
Being chased by something
Inside my heart is pounding
My throat dry like it's withering
For no single one,
To none does belong,
This time is ours, right now...
Unraveling the pain,
Unraveling our hearts,
Unraveling shadows
Stifling our breath,
Reaching for beyond,
Tearing through the dark
In fighting and in love
To the distant light above,
Yes, we are on the way
I wanna rock...
Rockin' my heart
The Village Hidden in the Leaves.
This is a Hidden Village that has producedmany superb Ninjas.
- Hey Naruto!. Why did you do such a thing?!- You're really gonna get it this time!.
The number one prankster of the village,aruto Uzumaki,
is a boy who is alsostriving to become a first-rate Ninja.
I don't care!.
Transform!
His strongest skill is the Sexy Jutsu.
- You fool!- However, Naruto had a secret inside him.
- Stop making idiotic spells!- that even he didn't know about.
At one time, the nine-tailed fox drovethe Village Hidden in the Leaves
to the brink of destruction...
That nine-tailed monster fox issealed within Naruto's body.
- Look at that one.- Therefore, he's been abhorred
- I hear he's the only one who failed.- as the Demon Fox by village grown-ups.
Serves him right.
Imagine what would happenif he becomes a Ninja.
Okay, you may open your eyes now.
Congratulations on your graduation.
However, that Naruto,
- Iruka Sensei!- on my sufferance,
- That hurts!- graduates from the Ninja Academy.
Say cheese!
He starts off on his first step as a Ninja.
Ninja missions are conductedby three-man cells.
Sasuke Uchiha.
A descendant of the Uchiha clan,
a distinguished family inHidden Leaf Village.
He is a boy towards whom Naruto harborsintense feelings of rivalry.
Sakura Haruno is a Kunoichi whoaruto has the hots for.
As a Ninja, Naruto carries out missionswith these two rookie Ninjas.
The one who observes andinstructs them,
Kakashi Hatake,also known as the Copy Ninja,
is Konoha’s most skilled Ninja.
One day, Naruto's group takes onthe mission to guard Tazuna,
a master bridge-builderof the Land of Waves.
All right! We're off!
However, Tazuna is targeted by a mannamed Gato
who attempts to controlthe Land of the Waves.
Stop your darned grumbling...!!
- Next time I'll kill him with...- And Gato had hired a terrifying man
- head chopper!- for Tazuna's assassination.
Zabuza Momochi...
A Rogue Ninja of the Village Hiddenin the Mist.
He was a man who had excelled atSilent Killing and
had successfully carried outmany assassinations.
Naruto and the gang havea tough time of it
in the face of Zabuza’s attacks...
Hey! You, with no brows...
Record in your Bingo Bookabout the man
who'll one day becomethe Leaf Village's Hokage.
Naruto Uzumaki!!
It's not so easy!
A Shuriken in the Shuriken's shadow...!
However, the shoe is on the other foot,
thanks to Naruto and Sasuke'sclose team work.
Kakashi copiesZabuza's Jutsu with Sharingan.
- W-What's that?!- It breaks Zabuza's composure.
Me...?
R-Ridiculous!
Is that his Genjutsu (illusion Jutsu)?
The Water Style! Giant Vortex Jutsu!!
No way!
It's over...
A Tracker Ninja boyfrom A Hidden Mist Village
is the one who deliveredthe final blow.
I must get rid this corpsebecause it contains many secrets.
Now then, please excuse me.
However, this boy, Haku...
was Zabuza's comrade.
Will you be all right the next time?
The next time...
I'll be able to see rightthrough the Sharingan.
Kakashi who has inferredthat Zabuza is still alive,
gives Naruto and gang...
- Ready!!- new training in preparation...
- Here I go!- for Zabuza's second assault.
And then,One week later...
This mist...
Sasuke! Sakura! They are coming!
This means a rival has emerged, Haku.
So it seems.
The time has come!
Secret Jutsu...
Crystal Ice Mirrors!
Now then... I'll start.
Take this!
Naruto Uzumaki...
is finally here!!
The Number One Hyperactive,Knucklehead Ninja Joins the Fight!
Now that I've come, you're all right!
Oh...
Naruto!
The hero of a story generally appearsin this kind of situation
and takes out the enemy in no time!
Heh... That brat, eh...
He's long on talk...
Man, that idiot!
Making such a conspicuous entrance...
There's no point if you don'tcatch the enemy off guard!
That boy...
What're you doing in a placelike this from morning?
Training!!
Why are you training?
I want to get stronger!
All right, here I go!Shadow Clone Jutsu...
Huh?!
Oh, no!
Huh?
Get out of the way, Naruto!
Whoa!
What?!
He's saved...
To think the enemy attackswould cancel each other out...
That was super lucky...
Hey! What're you doing, Naruto?!
Hey! What kind of idiotwould attempt
to cast a Jutsu directlyin front of an opponent?!
What?!
The essence of a Ninja is deception.How you deceive your opponent.
Even casting one Jutsu,you avoid the eyes of your opponents,
catch them off balance,and outsmart them...
The way you made your entrance earlier,that's just you coming to be a target...
N-Nooo.
But I went to the troubleof coming to the rescue.
What concerns me more than that is...
That guy...
Haku... What's the idea?
Zabuza, leave this kid to me...
Please let me fight this battle my way.
What did you say...?
So you mean no interfering... Haku?
You're naive... as usual...
I'm sorry...
Naive, eh...
True enough...
Judging from these wounds,
there's no mistaking thatI was attacked with a Senbon.
But no vital areas havebeen targeted so far.
Does he mean to half-kill me...?
If so!
As for me, I'll take you out first, so...!
It's impossible.It's too much for Naruto!
I should be the one to...
Hey. Don't get any ideas...
If you move,
you know what'll happento that old man, right?
True...
If I move away from here andhead towards Naruto,
Zabuza will kill Tazuna.
No way can Sakura completelyprotect him by herself.
How about it?
Let's just see how those young guysfight against each other.
That mask...
You were Zabuza's comrade, after all,weren't you!
You've got nerve to deceive us!
I'm sorry.
But, your teacher also said it,didn't he?
Things like deceiving andcatching one off guard is a Shinobi's duty.
Please don't take it personally.
You don't have that luxury, either!
Huh?
Sasuke?
I haven't...forgotten about you.
Here I thought he had disappeared...but he was there...
I would rather you hadjust gone down quietly.
But it looks like it won't workthat way.
Fine. I'll put an end to it first.
H-Hey!
Naruto. I'll get to you later.
W-What's with him...?
This is it!
So the real body is over there, eh...
Okay!
I'm over here.
He moved...? How?!
- Sasuke!- Sasuke!
What was that just now?!
Sasuke's body suddenly got battered...
How's he doing it?!
What kind of Jutsu is he using...?
It's conceivable that he has cloneshide in the mirrors and
gets them all to throwthe Senbons simultaneously...
No, they're too fast considering...
What does it mean...
not being able to see eventhe trajectory of the weapons...?
Also, if it's a mere Clone Jutsu...
I don't see a reason forthese ice mirrors...
In any case, there's no way to questionthat these mirrors are pivotal for his attacks.
What I can do is to launch attacks...
from both the outside and inside.
The thing to do is to figure outthe meaning of the mirror!
I'll take care of here!
All there is to do is...
for me to attack the inside and have Narutotry attacking the mirrors from the outside.
Yo! I came to save you.
You okay, Sasuke?
Oh...
What good will it do youto catch your ally off guard...?
Y-You idiot!
If you're a Shinobi,you'll move more cautiously!
What's with you?!
I came to the rescue, you know!
If you also come inside the mirrors...
Dang it! I've had it, you fool!
Fool?What do you mean by fool?!
As to be expected of thenumber one unpredictable Ninja.
He is making the situation worse andworse by coming to aid.
Since it's come to this,all that is left is to smash the mirrors!
Fire Style!
Hey! What're you going to do?!
These are mirrors madewith freezing water...
If so...
Fireball Jutsu!
It's not working at all!
They won't melt with thatlevel of firepower.
Darn it! Where'd he attack from?!Is it the clones?
Where's the real body?!
It's useless for you to evenattempt following with your eyes.
I absolutely will not be caught.
Humph. Shadow Clone Jutsu!
Don't!
If so, I'll find out which isthe real body by hitting them all!
This is a teleportation Jutsu that usesmirrors that can reflect only my image.
Watching you from the speed I move,
it almost seems as ifyou aren't moving at all...
I knew it!
Is that Jutsu... the Kekkei Genkai?!
Kekkei...Genkai...?
It's the same type as my Sharingan...
Deep blood ties...Lineage of paranormal individuals...
A type of Jutsu that is passed ononly through those traits...
Then...!
That's right...
It's impossible even for meto copy that Jutsu...
And there's no way to destroythat Jutsu, either!
Darn it...
So...what?!
I can't die here yet.
'Cause I have a dreamthat I must turn into reality...
The dream to have my strength recognizedby everyone in the village...
and become the Hokage!
Dream...
Pathetic brat.
Brats like you aren't neededby anyone
and die without ever knowingany freedom or dreams...
You have the same eyes as I do...
For me, becoming a Shinobi completelyis difficult.
If I can, I don't want to kill you guys...
And I don't want to get killedby you guys...
But if you guys aregoing to come at me...
I'll kill my feelings with a sword andcompletely become a Shinobi.
This bridge is the battlegroundthat connects each of us to our dreams.
I, for the sake of my dream.
And you, for the sake of your dreams.
Please don't hold it against me...
I want to protect the person dear to me...
I work for the sake of that person,I fight for that person,
and I want to make thatperson's dream a reality...
That's my dream.
For the sake of the dream,I will completely become a Shinobi...
and kill you guys!
Crystal Ice Mirror defeated!
Cuz' I've finally discovered the wayto break through it!
Heh-heh. Okay, Sasuke.
Let's pull out of this place andgo assist Kakashi Sensei.
I've had this bad feeling froma while ago.
Sensei, Sakura, please hold out somehowuntil we get there.

I never thought he'd attempt to usethe Fourth Hokage's Jutsu.
But it's still just this level...
It's completely differentfrom the original one.
That Tsunade...Incredibly strong as always.
I remember a long time ago,
getting punched by her andknocked back nearly 100 meters...
At any rate, Naruto's hopeless.
Are you okay?
Jiraiya, was it you...
who taught him that Rasengan,the Spiral Chakura Sphere?
Rasengan...?!
I'm his teacher, after all.
Humph...You and the Fourth Hokage arethe only ones who can use that Jutsu.
Are you in your right mind...
showing someone Jutsuthat he can't master?
Don't give him false hope.
That's why the moony kid starts jokingabout becoming a Hokage!
It's no joke! Stupid! Stupid!
If I have three days,I'll master this Jutsu!
You said it, kid.
Men don't go back on their word!
Hah! I stand by my words.
That's my Ninja Way.
Then... how about a wager?
A wager...?
I'll give you one week.
If you can master that Jutsu,
I'll acknowledge that you havewhat it takes to become the Hokage
and give you this necklace.
Lady Tsunade! That's the precious--!
I don't need such a sorry necklace!
Don't say such things, Naruto...
That's the only one of its kind in this world.
And you could buy three mountainsif you were to sell it.
It belonged to the First Hokage.
A-Awesome...
Well, that'll be fine!
He'll do anything for money...?
Good...
However, you lose if you can't masterthe Jutsu in one week!
And you'll give me all the moneyyou have on you.
Oh! Gama-chan!
When did she...?!
Lady Tsunade! Why?
That necklace is...
He won't be able to do it, anyway...
Let's go, Shizune.
She never once usedthat necklace for a bet...
You don't have to answer right now.
However, I want it in a week.
Inheritance!The Necklace of Death!
Huh? Who is it this late at night?
Okay, okay. I'm coming.
I'm sorry to bother you so late, Naruto.I need to talk to you...
As for me, I'm going to geta good night's rest and train tomorrow!
I'm sorry. But I didn't want youto misunderstand Lady Tsunade...
As well as the necklace...
Humph! I could care lessabout an old lady like that!
Lady Tsunade is not the typeof person you think she is!
Don't speak of her like thatwhen you don't even know her!
I-I'm sorry...for raising my voice.
She didn't used to be like that.
She was a kind personwho loved the village.
But, she changed...
After that day...
That day?
What's that day?
The day she lost her dreams,her love, her hopes... Everything.
All that was left wasthat necklace of memories...
It's as precious as life to Lady Tsunade.
It's really not somethingto be offered in a bet.
I don't care about that!She bet it on her own, right?!
Besides... that necklace is reallynot something for you to wear.
It's not just a necklace!
It doesn't acknowledge anyoneother than Lady Tsunade.
If someone else wears it,that person inevitably...
... dies!
Nawaki, happy twelfth birthday!
I'm not a kid anymore,so I don't need gifts on my birthday!
What're you saying?You're still a kid, aren't you?!
But never mind that.Hurry up and open your present!
You'll definitely be pleased!
Big Sister, could this be...?
Yes... It's the First Hokage's,our grandfather's necklace!
I love you, Big Sister!
I thought it'd be better than me having it.
You've been wanting it all along, right?Take good care of it.
Not just this necklace!
This village is grandfather's treasure!I'm going to protect it!
Nawaki...
I'm the grandson of the Hokage whobuilt the Village Hidden in Leaves, so...!
You said it.Men don't go back on their word!
Right!
Someday, I'll become just like Grandfather.And the Hokage name will be mine!
Becoming the Hokage is my dream!
Take off your headband, Nawaki.
Just hurry up and take it off.I have another present for you.
It's a charm to makeyour dream come true.
It's best if you don't lookat the remains.
There's nothing wrong with that,is there?
Even if she were to look,
she wouldn't be able to determinethat it's her little brother.
Enough, Orochimaru!
We are at war, now.All Shinobi end up like this.
There are no doctors onthe battlefield, so...
However, children really getmuch too excited, don't they?
Especially on the day afterthey receive a present.
Not just this necklace...
This village is grandfather's treasure!I'm going to protect it!
First, in a mission wherea Four-Man Cell must act alone
for a long period of timein enemy territory,
by deploying one of the fourto be a medical specialist,
the survival rate as well asthe mission success rate
should go up significantly.
Therefore, establishing a framework
to foster Ninja possessingadvanced medical skills
and the development ofa medical institution
should be consideredan urgent task for the present!
Yes indeed, it's as you say.
But we're in the middle of a war now.
It takes too much time toestablish a medical framework.
And at present,we don't have enough knowledge...
Enemies don't wait.
What did you say?! Hey, old man!
Then we'll never...
I agree with her.
I don't want the lives of the Shinobiwho died to be for naught.
There should be somethingwe can learn from that.
Excuse me!
Thanks for earlier.
What you said was right.
Umm...
It's late.Shall I walk you home?
What? Is that okay with you?Where's your home?
The other way.
Then don't bother.
I don't mind.I also want to talk with you.
And I would always use this pathto the Academy to pick up my little sister.
I loved this path.
What? You loved?
Yeah. In the battle when the Leafwas attacked at night one year ago,
my little sister was...
This man...is the same as me.
Tomorrow's mission will bewithin enemy lines...
Fighting and losing cherished peopleis not the only way for a Shinobi.
Uh-huh.
I'm living in a world of Shinobiwhere death always hovers.
I want to risk my life to bringthis war-torn world under control.
I love this village and my comrades.
So I want to protect them.
Since my little sister died,that sole thought has sustained me.
So I'll become the Hokage...
An existence that protects everyone...
Becoming the Hokage is my dream.
Dan...
I'd like you... to take this.
Hang on, Dan!
Tsunade... I don't want...to die yet.
I have many things that I must...do.
Don't talk, Dan!
His kidney has been blown out...
It's futile even for Tsunadewho is known as one of the Sannin...
I... must not...die here.
It'll be okay. I stopped the bleeding.
So it'll be okay... You'll be saved, Dan!
Really?
Thank goodness...
Dan! Hang on!
Dan!
Dang it! Don't come out...
Stop... Please stop!
Stop... Stop...
Stop... Stop...
Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop!
Stop, I say!
That's enough. He's dead!
You understand, don't you, Naruto...?
Ever since that day,
Lady Tsunade has been...in a constant turmoil.
Naruto...?
I'm heading out...for training!
Oh, you are already at it, I see!
Hi, welcome!
Why are you here?
You're cold. Don't say that.
Master Jiraiya...
Shizune, could you leave us?
It's been a while.I want to drink with her again.
Master, sake! And some radish!
Coming up!
I'm counting on you, Master Jiraiya.
Your radish is ready.
Ooh. This looks good.
At any rate, to think you'd still be takinggood care of that necklace...
I thought you'd have lost itlong since to gambling.
It's a memento of those two, right?
Is he on your mind...?
Who?
Naruto.
Not particularly...
Still, it's immature,taking on that kid as an opponent...
He shouldn't be able to masterthat Jutsu in a week, right?
That's not what's called a bet.
What's with the fit of despair?
It's not a fit of despair!
Are you going to meetOrochimaru again?
I can tell by looking at Shizune's face.
I don't know what kind of dealhe proposed,
but don't rush to a decision.
And... let me just tell you one thing.
The successive line of Hokageshave protected
the Leaf Village and those living in it.
They brought troubled times under controland helped the village to prosper.
They risked their livesfor this dream, this ideal!
You're not someone who can't understandthe feelings of the previous Hokages.
Just try doing somethingto betray the Leaf Village.
When that happens, I'll kill you myself!
It has nothing to do with me now!
A person who has experiencedthe death of people close to them
and doesn't feel anythingis just a butcher.
You're different, aren't you?
No one cared for the welfareof the villagers more than you.
At that time, too...
That's enough with the lecture!
Why... did you bring that kid?
Becoming the Hokage is my dream.
He resembles him, doesn't he?
His age is about the same, too...
Not just that...
Becoming the Hokage is my dream!
Geez, you do nothing,but reckless things.
Do you want to die?
You're still a Genin,so on the battlefield just run away.
Don't tell a man to "run away"!
That dream... And his cockiness as well...
No good! Dang it! Dang it!Tomorrow, for sure...!
My head hurts.
I totally got sick from drinking,thanks to her...
It seems Naruto never came homelast night...
He's such a fool.
Why don't we make a deal?
I'll resurrect the little brotherand man, both of whom you loved...
with the Forbidden Jutsu I've developed.
Don't you want to see those two,Tsunade?
If I treat your arms...
What do you intend to do with them?
This time, I will completelydestroy Leaf Village!
No! You must not believein their sweet talk...
Their wishes...
Moreover, Tsunade, your wishes...And dreams... Did you forget them?!
I'll be straight with you.
Tsunade, the village has demandedthat you become the Fifth Hokage.
I believe your promise,its a true heart give me courage
Always I feel itthe precious time with you
On your still shoulder
I feel the wind that blowstowards tomorrow
The city lights are like pieces of stars
That hold us together
"Each one of us glows differently, "
you say laughingly
but you look most dazzling
Like a comet,
like the rainbow after the storm
You bring light into my heart
Being lost can be the answer
Let's promise we won't cheat
Uh...like a shooting star,we do go ahead.
Darn it! What am I doing?!
I fell asleep at suchan important time!
Moreover, today is the dayof the bet!
Meanwhile, I don't even know wherethat old lady Tsunade has gone to!
My training is not completed yet...
I've got to play it by earand rely on a one-shot deal!
Next time: "A Dubious Offer!Tsunade's Choice"Connecting old words that have been used up
I just want to convey my simple thoughts
That day's faint wind blows away
at the castle ruins of yesterday
I'll laugh with you and live for the moment
Still that incident will continue to trouble you, right?
That's why it must be good-bye
Leaving nothing behind, let us share what is left
In time, we'll realize that it was everything
And sadness will touch our cheeks, creating a river of tears
Trembling thoughts swept into a vortex and melting away

Not yet? Idate hasn't come, yet?
My lord, we finally found evidence
regarding the matterwe were investigating.
Oh, I see.
Mm, good work.
My lord, is there something amiss?
No, it's nothing.
Concentrate on my Chakra.
We're saved.
Sasuke, are you okay?
Naruto, I'm counting on you.
Protect Idate.
The Last Leg:A Final Act of Desperation
Poison needles won't work on me.
How dare you do thatto Sasuke and Sakura?!
Rest easy.
I'll send you to the placewhere they are real soon.
I won't go so easily!
Naruto.
But what do I do?
The Rasenganwon't work on his sword.
It doesn't matter.
Those two are waiting for my help!
Saving each other again, huh?!
They wouldn't survivefalling off this cliff.
Shut up!
Multi Shadow Clone Jutsu.
Oh... you're going to run awayfrom here using such a diversion?
Don't mess with me!Who's going to run away?
Naruto, it's futile.That technique won't work on that sword!
It's futile!
Naruto!
Just like the Uchiha loser earlier,
why is it that each and everyLeaf Village Ninja is an idiot?
Shut up!
I'm going to save those two!
Are you seriously thinkingthey're alive after falling off this cliff?
You should've gotten out of here.
As if...
I'd abandon my comradesand run away!
That's my answer to the tenth problem!
What're you saying?
One more time.
Eat this.
Idiot.
Rasengan!
Naruto...!
You still don't get it?!You don't have a chance of winning!
Damn!
That's...
the damage Sasuke inflicted.
That's it!
If I aim for that...
I can win!
You saying you still want to fight?Give it up, already!
Shut up! Shadow Clone Jutsu!
Sasuke...
Sasuke gave me a chance!I won't waste it!
Naruto...
Stay still!
Sasuke! They're usingthe Water Clone Jutsu!
I know!
Trust us, Idate!We'll protect you, no matter what!
S-Sakura...
Go on ahead.We'll be right behind you.
Sakura!
I...
I hate people who don't knowwhen to quit.
This is the end.
A foolish cheap trick.
What?!
I'm saying I can't stand thissaving each other business.
Idate!
Your opponent is over here!
Above!
Rasengan!
What?!
It can't be!
Naruto, you did it!
Naruto...
You're really something.
Yeah, well...
Sakura!
Naruto...! Idate...!
Sakura!
She's okay?
Sasuke's okay, too.
I'm coming to save you now,believe it.
Idiot. Forget about us andget going to the finish line, quick!
Oh, that's right.
But what should we do about this?
Leave it to me.
We'll cut the rope and goto the opposite bank in one swing!
I get it!
I thought the worst of myself.
But Boss Jirocho trusted in me.
I trust you more than anyone.
It was the first timeI was trusted by someone.
So I wanted to win this racefor the boss, no matter what.
But in reality, I can't winjust with such feelings.
So many times along the way,I felt like giving up.
Watch out!
But each time,
you guys risked your livesto save a lame duck like me!
Naruto, I'm sorry.
I should've trusted you guysfrom the start.
What're you saying?
Say stuff like thatafter winning the race.
You're right.
Naruto!
Idate!
Okay, do it!
Right!
Boo! Boo! Boo!
Now that's a rousing welcome.
Naruto, at this rate,we'll crash into the rocks!
I know. Leave it to me!
Release Chakra fromthe bottom of my feet.
It's the very last Chakra!
Then stick tothe rocks with Chakra!
All right, Naruto!
Now dash to the finish line!
Sakura, I'll come backto help you right away!
Okay. Let's go, Idate.
Right!
Run steady, Fukusuke!
Stay sharp until the end.
Shut up! I know.
Geez...spoiling my good mood.
I can see the Todoroki Great Shrine.
Boss!
Blast it!
Good, good.
Idate.
- Hey!- Oh!
Hey! What's that?
Here he comes!
Idate of the Wasabi Family's here!
Go!
You can still catch up!
What?!
Idate!
Idiot!
What're you doing, Fukusuke?! Run!
Damn it!
I won't lose.
I will not lose!
I won't give up until the very end!
Like heck. I won't be passed upafter I've come this far!
- All right!- He caught up.
Blast this guy...!
I won't lose, you little...!
Blast...
Idate...!
Come on, Idate!
Boss!
Go! Idate...!
All right!
I did it!
Idate.
You ran a fine race.
Boss!
You did well.
Boss, I'm sorry. I'm truly sorry.
You fool. What're you apologizing for?
You won.
No, please let me speak.
I really want to apologize now.I'm truly sorry!
You're making no sense to me.What a totally weird guy.
Well done, Idate.
I was wrong about you.
Okay, Idate.Go receive the winner's blessing.
Yes!
Hey, Idate!
Hey, you idiot!
Bringing shame upon the boss!You're prepared, aren't you?
I-I'm sorry!
The winner!
Idate Morino of the Wasabi Family!
He finally did it.
Hey, hey... Just a minute.
Kyuroku.
Along the way, he rodeon the back of a hired Ninja.
This is a violation.
W-What?
There's proof.
Look at this photo.
Racing until the end on your own strengthis the rule of this race.
Therefore, Idate is disqualified.
The winner is Fukusuke Hikyakuyaof the Wagarashi Family.
No way.
H-Hold it. That was...!
I'll hear no excuses!Jirocho, it's a promise.
I order the Wasabi Familydissolved immediately.
Just a minute.
There is no such rule anywhere.Do not speak nonsense!
M-My lord!
Or perhaps...
you have a reason for wantingthe Wagarashi to win at all cost?
No, nothing like that.
Could it be because you wouldnot be able to do things like this?
Look.
You fool!Retire and enter the monastery!
Yes, yes, my lord!
Kyuroku Wagarashi.
Y-Yes?
Word of your evil deedshas reached my ears as well.
Your sins against the peopleof Degarashi Port are severe.
Therefore, the Wagarashi Familyis to be dissolved as of today.
Understood?
Y-Yes, sire.
Today is an auspicious day.
With this, the matter is settled.
Thanks for the help, Naruto.
Idate, this is good-bye, huh?
I've come to get the wounded.
Ibiki.
B-Big Brother!
Where are the wounded?
Over here.
Okay, get him on the boat, quickly.
R-Right.
Um, excuse me.
What is it?
N-Nothing.
Brother!
Wait, Big Brother!
Who are you?
The man who called meBig Brother died three years ago.
Big Brother... I figured outthe answer to the tenth problem!
I'll never betray a comrade again!
I can trust others now!
He's looking good now.
'Bye, Idate. Let's meet again.
Good-bye. See you around.
Yeah. You guys come again, too, okay?
I wish you good health, Boss!
Yeah...
See ya!
Take care!
An interesting guy as always.
No wonder the Fifth Hokagesees potential in him.
Naruto! Thanks!
Idate! Next time,it'll be a battle with me, believe it.
Sasuke, does it hurt?
No.
Thank goodness.
Those wounds will heal immediatelyonce we get back to the village.
Right.
The rumors were true.
The survivor ofthe village's honorable Uchiha Clan...
is just a good-for-nothing kid...
I couldn't beat him!
And yet, he...
that Naruto...!
Once in a long while, once in a while
The remnants of a personbroken by dreams
Look like a mountain
Clinging to the Divine,clinging to Buddha
The remnants of a person crying
Look like a mountain
Rendezvous with a happy dance circle
This is my victory pose, round and around(round around)
Shake shake shakeLet's look
With a bye-bye rhythm that never ends
Look like a mountain
Look like a mountain
Look like a mountain
Look like a mountain
Hey Sasuke and Naruto,what's happened to both of you?
This is a hospital,and Sasuke's still recuperating!
Even you should know better, Naruto.

Sasuke...
My, my arm!
Are you okay, Lord Orochimaru?
Please take this medicine quickly.
Oh, my...
Just as I get back,I have to clean the room.
Please make sure you to takeyour medicine.
I don't need that kindof lip service.
It's medicine that I prescribed.
The pain should subsideat least slightly.
The pain on this armthat seems to burn...
I never thought that it causethis much suffering.
Sarutobi... known as Third Hokage.It's his last curse, after all.
Enough of the talking...
More importantly,has that individual been found?
Yes... She seems to be at a placecalled Tanzaku Town.
Tanzaku Town...
Is that so...?
But the opponent is one of the Sannin,the Legendary Three Ninjas.
It won't be that simple.
Good medicine tends to taste bitter.
Here.
It's the same one...But this is the trick?
You're the type who was yelled atat the academy
for not having concentration, right?
That doesn't have anythingto do with me now.
Look at this paper.
Uh?
I've seen it.
Fine, then.
Look at it again.
Hmm?
So what is this?
It's not something thatI need to explain in length,
but when you first lookedat this blank piece of paper,
you just glanced atthe whole thing, correct?
Probably.
Then where do you look on this one?
Most likely the point in the middle?
When a human being looks atjust a blank piece of paper,
he doesn't know where to look,so the eyes wander.
But if you put even a single point on it,
the mind focuses there...
This is concentrating at a single pointand as you focus your mind,
you become spiritually stable andyou are able to extract unexpected power.
Huh?
When you opened a holeon the rubber ball,
you must have beenconcentrating desperately
to fill up the Chakrain the palm of your hand.
Yeah, yeah.
When you concentrate,power emerges.
But without a target,it is difficult to concentrate.
That's why we have this...
Listen Naruto, from now on,
when you store up the Chakrayou build in your right hand,
try to store it up by concentratingon that mark.
Concentrate...
All right, I'll try it!
Focal Point:The Mark of the Leaf
Concentrate!
Darn it. It's not supposed to be like this.
It has to break like "pang."
Concentrate!
Hello... I'd like to make a little inquiry.
Dang it.
Concentrate.
Concentrate!
No good.
Dang it. What does it meanto concentrate?!
Damn you, Sarutobi!
All right then...
I'm going again to gathersome information.
What...? But you just came.
I don't have any time to waste.
Hey, hey...!
Isn't there going to be evena little soulful game of catch
between the master and pupil?
You scoundrel.
Strike!
Here, the game of catch is over.
See you later.
Humph... I'll forget about that Pervy Sageand work hard by myself.
That's the only way, Naruto...
You have to do this training alone.
You have the ability to approachthe Fourth Hokage's level...
Grasp it by yourself!
Hmm... Never seen her.
If that's the case...
Sorry to bother you.
I know the person.
As well as where she is right now.
I'll buy you a drink.
There's no need.I was able to win a tidy sum...
Thanks to that lady.
Yeah...you are indeedthe Legendary Sitting Duck.
She lost again, huh.
Her losses started to pile up...
So she was talking aboutchanging her location.
Where to?
One of the Sannin, Lady Tsunade,is staying at Tanzaku Town over there.
Then this arm can finally...
Even if it's good medicine,
you won't get away with justa bitter taste with that person.
It's fine.
Seven, seven, seven...
Seven, seven, seven...
Seven, seven, seven...
Here it comes!
Congratulations to the customer!
Fever has startedon machine number 44.
Now, please keep on getting it outlike a flood.
Lady Tsunade, a rare thing does happenonce in while.
A 3-7 for me?
Oh wow, lady.
Yeah, what a great work.
Wish I could be favoredby good fortune too.
- Oh, here it comes again!- Here it comes again!
Yay... it's "fever" again!
A person like me pullsa big hit like this...
I have a bad premonition.
I also have some knowledgeregarding Lady Tsunade...
I did use to be part ofthe Medical Corps, after all.
She was the first person to proposewhat is now an accepted practice
of assigning one medical specialistto a small squad of four.
This was a very revolutionary-idea...
A small combat unit that doesn'teven have emergency medical skills,
what would happen to them in a battlefieldis clearer than seeing fire.
Countless experiences in war
simply became knowledgeto equip themselves with.
Many who were sacrificedled to the creation of that style.
A person understands the natureof things for the first time
after losing them.
And the thing created byone of the legendary Sannin,
who is known as the medical specialist
is that sacrifice.
Not working...
I got to concentrate even more.
Concentrate, concentrate.
Concentrate, concentrate.
Concentrate!
Concentrate...
Concentrate on one point.
Strike!
Strike!
That stupid perve's face floats upin my head
and I can't even concentrate.
Oh boy...
Some gal somewhere is talkingabout me again.
Pinball Games
Wait for me, Lady Tsunade!
What's the matter?
Your winning this much is like a miracle...
But you don't look pleased at all.
This town.
Huh?
I get a bad premonition.
We're going to hurry up and leave.
But this is a tourist resort...
We should take our time andgo see the famous castle and all.
Then we're going to hurry upand see it so we can leave.
But... Lady Tsunade!
Lord Orochimaru!
Let's get this business over with.
Even if we have to usea slightly rough method.
I got to do it.
Ouch!
Ouch... It hurts so much,I can't even build up my Chakra...
He might be reaching his limit soon.
Just a bit...just a bit more rest.
Hey!
You guys, we're in class right now.
You...fools!
You guys have no concentration at all...!
This is not the way tobecome fine Ninja.
How can we stay still at a table,right, Akamaru?
I'm hungry.
Sensei, if it's a scolding,do it quickly.
What the--?! You, you guys...
From now, we will havean after-school lesson
to teach you guys more concentration!
- What?!- What?!
What's this?
You guys are going to do from now
what the predecessors ofthe Leaf Village
used to perform every dayas a concentration method!
It is training to build up Chakra
by concentrating your entire energyon the leaf on your forehead.
It's an ancient way of learning
how not to become distractedfrom anything else
by concentrating on a single point,the leaf.
The one who hones his concentrationis truly a great Ninja...
This is the origin of the Leaf Symbolon the headband.
That sounds like a lie.
Aren't you making that story upto force us to try harder?
I'm not making this up!It's a true story.
Anyhow, can you really becomea great Ninja
by just polishing your concentration?
At any rate,a great Ninja is a guy who's strong.
Hey, you have a point.
This stuff...
Bye, bye Sensei!
Hey, hey, you guys wait a minute.
- We won't wait!- We don't have time for that!
Hey! You misfits!
This is the same thing.
I should have paid more attentionto what Iruka Sensei was saying...
I'm so stupid.
But nothing will startif I just keep on regretting.
All right, I'm going to master this!
Concentrate, concentrate...
Concentrate!
Wow! Tanzaku Castle sure does havea commanding presence!
It's worth being designatedas the cultural heritage.
Don't dally...
We're going to hurry upand leave this town.
Lady Tsunade, please look more carefully...
It costs nothing to view.
Lady Tsunade?
What is this chill?
Now!
What a kid...
Raising the density in Chakrato the point that it burns the palm.
He never ceases to amaze me.
It broke.
Good! The second step seemsto be complete.
Hurry... The third step.
That will come later.
We'll now go meet Tsunade.
That's...
Orochimaru.
I found you.
A cycle of hardship, right?
Inside, we were crying, right?
But the one thing we won't give upis the dream we've chosen, right?
It's a secondary role,
a role in the shadows
But in reaching for that dream,
let us stay centered,let us stay true
Over and over,we hung on without giving up
Over and over,we kept coming back up
Over and over,we believed and dreamed
Over and over,we've seen fools
Over and over,we've stood in the shadows of others
Now, it's our turn...Let us bask in our dreams
I can master the third step while walking?Give me a break!
Fool! If we don't hurry it up,we'll lose Tsunade!
Besides, she's short-temperedand impatient!
Where are we heading?
If she's here in this town, we'll justlook for her from somewhere high up.
- So we'll climb up a castle.- Castle?!
- Can't you see over there?!- Which way is "over there"?
I'm saying...
Oh! What the--?!
Next time: "An Impossible Choice:The Pain Within Tsunade's Heart"Yeah, turn your sadness into kindness, your uniqueness into strength
Even if you get lost, let's start walking
One more time
Are you really happy
when you're always meeting to someone's expectations?
Even if you change to who you really wanna be
Will you always have a great smile?
Dreaming of only "the beginning," I wake up
and someday, I'll live on my own.
Yes, precious things are never in shape
You never know what it is when you get it or lose it
Yeah, turn your sadness into kindness, your uniqueness into strength
Even if you get lost, let's start walking
One more time

Hey! Geez.
Hey, Pervy Sage!
Weren't you going towatch my training?!
I'm researching now.
Do it yourself!
All right, then I 'll summon a frog,a frog so big you'll be shocked!
The Summoning Jutsu!
Hmm? What's wrong?Did a frog appear?
W-Wait a minute!
What part of that's a frog?!
If you don't get serious,I won't help you!
Shut up! I am being serious!
Then somehow find your Chakraas if your life depended on it!
That's what I'm doing!
Huh?!
Sasuke...
Hey Sakura!
Huh?!
Sakura! It's about time you wakeand help me over here!
I'm not sleeping!I'm busy right now!
Yes, yes...Then when won't you be busy?
Later!
I can't believe it... Geez!
A Feeling of Yearning,A Flower Full of Hope
Some of you have probablyalready heard but...
Gekko Hayate's corpse wasfound near Kikyo Castle...
What... Hayate?
No way...
That's ridiculous!
Is the opponent Orochimaru?
No...we shouldn't jump tothat conclusion so easily.
The one Hayate was followingwas likely a Sound spy called Kabuto...
Well, it's certain that Orochimaruis trying to do something but...
So...we'll cancel Chunin Examand go after Orochimaru...?!
No, he revealed his identity to Anko...
sending us a threat not to cancel.
Not to cancel the Chunin Exam
for which all of the Ninja ofthe Alliance have gathered!
What does it mean?
Orochimaru possesses enough powerto take down a small Land on his own.
He's a Ninja that probablyevery land has eyes on.
Moreover, he conveniently holdsa grudge
against this Village Hiddenin the Leaves.
Any Land would desire him.
So could it be...
that any Land in the Alliancewould unite with Orochimaru
and betray the Village Hiddenin the Leaves?!
Well, the Alliance Treaty is atthe same level as a verbal agreement!
As was in the former Great Ninja War...
In any case,
there's too little informationright now.
Let's end these unnecessarysuspicions.
We've already dispatched Anbu,
the black ops to each Landto collect information.
It's dangerous to act carelessly...
That could be what the enemyis aiming for.
And also...
I trust all of you!
When the time comes,
we'll bring all the powers of Hidden LeafVillage together and simply fight!
At that time...
Be quiet about this bruise!
Should I have stopped him forcefully...?
No visitors...?
That's correct.I'm sorry but...
I know he's been hospitalized,but no visitors...?!
What's going on?
We're also not aware of the details so...
There's no use worrying about it here.
Huh?
Should I bring get-well flowers?
So pretty.
Oh no!
Oh... How unusual for you to comeby to buy our flowers.
N-Not really!Why would you care?
Besides, isn't it unusual thatyou're minding the shop?
I'll choose quickly.
People don't like flowers withroots when they're in the hospital
since they don't want tobe "rooted"in the hospital...
So cut flowers are fundamental.
W-What are you talking about...?
Playing dumb won't work.
You're going to see Sasuke, right?
Mom! I'm going out for a bit!
I-Ino?!
I won't let you be the first to visit!I'm going with you!
A get-well visit!
Shucks... Ino pig!
I'm taking this flower...
One "rose" of love!
That's so cliche...
Then I'll make mine this."Narcissus"!
A noble flower that doesn'tsuccumb to the cold of the winter,
but hopes for the spring andwaits with dignified presence...
with the wish for release fromthe hospital as soon as possible.
You've gotten pretty knowledgeable.
I told you I wouldn't lose to you!
Oh, yes yes, so one narcissus, right?
Uh... I need two.
Why? One is fine.
No... One for Lee too.
More please!
- Huh?!- Huh?
Ten orders of kalbi!
You sure can eat.Just watching you makes me feel ill.
Here you are!
It's here!
This is mine, all right?Don't eat any of it, Shikamaru!
I won't eat any!
What's going on with you guys,barbecue in the middle of the day?
- Oh...?- Huh?
Ino and Sakura...
Shikamaru, shouldn't you be going throughsome special training or something
to prepare for the final exam?
I am...
Every single day...
Asuma is so persistent.
Actually, Choji's been joining usin the special training.
Really?
So you took it on?
Yup! In exchange, he's treating meto as much barbecue as I can eat!
I see...
Oh, I shouldn't have held onfor the Final Round.
Don't be ridiculous!
There are numerous people whowant to participate, but can't!
That's right!
From what I've heard,
they're doing some awfullydifficult things
over at Guy and Kurenai's team!
W-What's that?
Even though we've madeit this far,
to get totally thrashedwouldn't be very cool...
Aw man, what a drag...
Whatever the circumstances,
we've exceededa human being's limits.
So I've used too much Chakra...
Neji, are you all right?!
Summoning Jutsu!
What?! A tadpole again?!
You haven't madeany progress whatsoever!
See how it's biggerthan the ones earlier?!
How the heck should I know?!
So you want to seeSasuke Uchiha...?
Just five minutes.
I can't allow you to visitany longer than that.
His body still needs to rest...
Yes...
Sasuke. You have visitors...
Two cute young ladies...
Oh...!
- Huh?- Huh?
Sasuke, Sasuke?
His clothes are gone!
- What?!- What?
It's terrible! He's in no conditionto be walking outside yet!
Doctor! Doctor!
Sasuke...
No way...
Sasuke will, withouta doubt, desire me...
Sasuke... Where in the worldhave you gone...?
Could cliff-climbing be so taxing...?
Damn, my body is sluggish...
Will I make it in time...?
Open!
Huh?
Y o!
Huh... You finally made it here...
We'll search for Sasukeon our end.
But if you happen to see him,please contact us.
- We will.- Yes.
And also...you wanted to see Lee, right?
- Yes.- Yes.
He's also in no condition to move,so please make your visit brief.
Lee, you have visitors.
Two cute young ladies...
Oh?!
- Huh?!- Huh?!
Really... even Lee!
Lee! Lee!
Lee...
Huh?
Look!
Huh?
Lee...?!
Sakura, let's go!
Okay!
200 one-armed pushups...
If I can't do them,1 00 one-legged squats...
1 90...!
Lee! Stop it!Lee! Stop it!
1 91...
Lee!
Please don't touch me!
Don't... interfere...with my training...
I need two...
Why? One is fine.
No... One for Lee too...
Speaking of which, Sakura,did you hear about that Lee?
What? Hear what?
Well, that Lee...
his injuries were serious andhe can no longer...
continue as a Shinobi.
1 95...
1 96...
1 97...
1 98...
I'm...not finished...yet!
There's no value in makingan effort for someone
who doesn't believe in himself!
One...one hundred... ninety... nine...
One... One more...
One more time...!
- Huh?!- Oh!
Lee...!
I'll... go get the stretcher.
Please keep an eye on him.
Yes.
Hey... Ino...
Huh?
Why do boys...have to push themselves?
Don't ask me that.I'm a girl you know!
Sorry...
The Human...Boulder!
Ninja Art: Shadow Possession Ju...!
Darn it, I don't have enough Chakra!
What's the matter, Shikamaru?!
Have you hit your limit already?
Man! What a drag...
All right, Choji!One more time!
Who brought that...?
The rose I went to the troubleof bringing was a waste.
My narcissus too...
Oh... How boring.
Hey, Naruto!
The swimsuit gals have gone,so why don't we call it a day?
What? Let's stay a little longer!
Come on, a little longer...Just a little longer!
I'm hungry. And I'm pretty tired too.
You haven't even done anything.
You should be thankfulI hung out with you!
He's getting ticked off at me.
All right, I got it... Sexy Jutsu!
Oh!
What, that's it?
What I want to do isn't the Sexy Jutsu,but Summoning Jutsu!
All right, all right...Then try it out.
Here goes--!
Summoning... Jutsu!
I did it!
You should die!You have no talent!
Take a careful look!
Huh?
See, it has rear legs!
You idiot! Conjure one up withhands, feet and ears!
Shut your mouth!Having legs is better than before!
One! First, Tyson jumps and slamdunks
Two! He kisses and hugs everyonerandomly and says "l LOVE YOU"
Three! Masala masters Yogabut hates curry
Four! Sanchez is a lousy bullfighter. Ole!
All over the world, the sky's smiling,so look up and smile too
Oh yeah! Oh yeah! Oh yeah!Fight! Fight! Fight!
One! Bodimahattaya-san devoteshis time for digging black ships
Two! Peking Duck, Action Scene,Chen Lee speeds around on his bike

All over the world, the sky's smiling,so look up and smile too
Oh yeah! Oh yeah! Oh yeah!Fight! Fight! Fight!
Ichiraku's ramen isas good as usual!
If the training continues like this,I don't mind doing it forever!
Eat, keeping eating more becausethis will be the last...
What? Did you say something?
Do you like the food?
Hey master, one more bowlof ramen please!
Good. Just keep eating away soyou'll have no regrets about your life.
Next time, "Live or Die:Risk it All to Win it All!"

Sasuke...?
No... Who is he?
He's got the same Sharinganas Sasuke.
Really...
who'd believe a kid like you tohave the Nine-Tailed Fox in him.
Why does that guy knowabout the Nine-Tailed Fox?!
Naruto, you will come with us.
Roar, Chidori!Brother vs. Brother!
That guy is...close by!
That guy!
Elder Brother...
Today...
when school's over,help me train for a Shuriken Jutsu...
I'm busy... Have father teach you.
But you're better at Shuriken Jutsu,Elder Brother...
Even I can see that.
You always treat melike a pest, Elder Brother.
Ouch!
Forgive me Sasuke...Some other time, okay?
I don't have time topay attention to you today.
You're always jabbing my foreheadand saying "Forgive me, Sasuke!"
You also say "not today,"but there's never a day.
Father.
Huh?
Why doesn't Elder Brotherpay any attention to me?
That guy's a little strange...
He's the type that doesn't really liketo become intimate with people.
Why?
I don't know.
I am his father andstill I can't read that boy...
Here!
Your boxed lunch, Sasuke!
If you're worried about doingShuriken Jutsu practice,
I will watch you when you get home.
They're not practices,they're training!
See you later!
Sasuke, are you onyour way to school?
Yes.
I saw Itachi earlier on.He's really become a man.
He's already a top-notch Shinobi.
He graduated at the head of his classat the Academy at the age of seven,
and attained Chunin levelat the age of ten, didn't he?
He became adept at usingSharingan at the age of eight.
Yes, I remember.
That boy is trulythe pride of the Uchiha clan.
By the way,how old are you now, Sasuke?
I'm the same age aswhen Elder Brother graduated,
but I can't...
What's the matter?
Hey!
Stop talking nonsense!
Oh my, dear.
Sasuke, both you and Itachicome from the same Uchiha clan,
the pedigree ofthe Hidden Leaf Village.
Have confidence!
You'll be an amazingShinobi just like Itachi one day.
Yeah!
See you later!
Do your best!
Study hard!
That's right...
I come from the same Uchiha clanas Elder Brother...
I won't lose to Elder Brother!
I'm pretty late...
What was that?
I had the feelingthere was someone there...
The lights are out.Even though it's not time for bed...
What's this?!
W-What's this?!
What in the world is this?!
Uncle... Auntie...
Father... Mother...!
Father? Mother?
Aren't you here?
There's somebody here!
Move!
Move!
Move!
Father! Mother!
Elder Brother!
Elder Brother!Father and Mother are...!
Why? For what reason?!
Who in the world would dosomething like this...?
Elder Brother... What are you...?
What are you doing,Elder Brother!
Foolish little brother...
Mangekyo Sharingan!
My legs...!
Stop!
Elder Brother!
Don't make me see this!
Why...?
Why did you, Elder Brother...?!
No...!
No...
Auntie! Uncle!
Father! Mother!
Stop it! Elder Brother!
Don't kill Father and Mother!
W-Why...
Why did you...? Elder Brother...?
T o measure my abilities...
Measure your abilities...?Just for that?
Are you saying that...
Just for that...you killed them all?
That is of great importance.
What do you mean...?
Don't talk rubbish!
I'm scared...
I'm scared!
Don't kill me...!
D-Don't kill me!
You are not even worth killing...
Foolish little brother...
If you want to kill me, begrudge me!Hate me!
And keep on surviving inthat unsightly manner...
Just continue fleeing and fleeingand hang onto your life!
Shall we go outside...?
These guys aren't just anybody...
Itachi, it'll be a pain in the neckif this kid moves around and...
Maybe I better chop offa leg just in case...
W-What did he say?!
Now then...
Long time no see...
Sasuke.
Itachi Uchiha!
Itachi... Uchiha?
The same as Sasuke...An Uchiha...
Huh...Sharingan...
And moreover,he resembles you a lot...
Who the heck is he?
He's my younger brother.
But I heard that the entire Uchiha clanhad been murdered.
By you.
Itachi Uchiha... I will kill you!
I must kill one certain manwithout fail!
That man...
My elder brother...
I thought I couldn't die...without killing him, but...
That's the guy that Sasukewas saying...
The man he wanted to kill...
It's just as you said...
I held a grudge against youand hated you.
For the singular purpose ofkilling you, l...
I...
have lived my life!
Sasuke...!
Chidori...?
I will kill you!
Die!
W-What's going on?!
I can't believe that Sasuke's Jutsuwas so easily thwarted...
This doesn't look good!
I've got to do something!
Chakra permeates the air...
I see...
So this is the Nine-Tailed Fox Chakra!
You jerk!
You're in the way!
Sasuke!
Darn it!
Ninja Art: Summo...
You're too slow!
Huh...? I can't feel the Chakra...
Darn! Darn! Why is it?!
My sword Shark Skinhas the ability to...
cut through and eat Chakra!
It's a pain in the butt
if the kid moves aroundand uses Jutsu like that...
Before these legs...
Should I chop off these arms?
Why doesn't it emerge?!
It's pointless...
What?
You guys just don't know me much,do you?
This man Jiraiya does not fall victimto any woman's allurement,
but rather his forte iswinning women's affection!
I'm not made to blindly follow aftera woman's feminine charm!
When you get to my level,
women yelp with delightat my sex appeal!
A cycle of hardship, right?
Inside, we were crying, right?
But the one thing we won't give upis the dream we've chosen, right?
It's a secondary role,
a role in the shadows
But in reaching for that dream,
let us stay centered,let us stay true
Over and over,we hung on without giving up
Over and over,we kept coming back up
Over and over,we believed and dreamed
Over and over,we've seen fools
Over and over,we've stood in the shadows of others
Now, it's our turn...Let us bask in our dreams
Watch out, Sasuke!
Naruto, don't help him.
But... Sasuke is!
It is your duty to watchthrough this battle, Naruto.
What?!
This is his fight...
This represents everything thathe has been carrying up to now.

I've done it!The water is turning!
It seems it's going to be easierthan I thought to break it.
Then I'll go take a little restuntil it's done...with this.
Hey! What is that?!
I need it to kill the time.And also to get some sleep.
Huh! The way it's going,it won't even be an afternoon nap!
Is that so...?Call me when it is broken.
Just wait!
If it keeps up like this,I'll learn it within today!
Keep on Training!Pop Goes the Water Balloon
Oh man! Why doesn't it break!
Huh? Are you done with it?
Ah...well, it's almost doneor how should I call it.
Oh boy...
It seems like I went beyondan afternoon nap and had a deep sleep.
Hey, hey... how do I break it?
Didn't I tell you I can't givea detailed explanation until it's broken?
All right, I understand...
Naturally, you're supposed to realize itthrough trial and error
when mastering a Jutsu, but...
Yeah, yeah.
I guess I'll teach you justa tiny bit on the Jutsu...
You, try rotating the water!
Oh, okay.
Right or left...which direction did youimagine when you rotate it?
Hmm...well, to the left...
Hey, come over here.
Okay...
Huh, I thought so...
W-What?
You are in fact a right-rotation type.
Right?
In order to build up Chakra,
it is necessary to blend the energy...
ChakraSpiritual energy Physical energySo everybody unconsciously builds upChakra inside the body by rotating it.
Right LeftWhether the rotation at that pointis to the right or to the left
differs in the individual.
Therefore, if you imaginethe rotation of the water balloon
opposite to that of your rotation-typein this training,
your Chakra flow divides and resists
and the momentum ofthe rotation does not get on track.
You should be able to figurethat kind of stuff on your own.
But how did you figure out thatI'm a right-type so fast?
The cowlick on your head!
It's pretty much determined that you'rea right type if a whorl rolls to the right
and you're a left-typeif it rolls to the left.
It's simple.
Huh, so I have a right roll!
Yes, so if you want to rotate it,you have to imagine a right rotation.
I never really paid attentionthat until now...
But this Jutsu is just the one for you.
Hand sign is completely unnecessary.All you need is Chakra.
There is no need to learna finicky hand sign!
It's okay to be stupid!
I'm not stupid!
I'm the man who's eventually goingto become a Hokage!
It's easy once you understand!
This Jutsu, I'll completely master itif I got three days!
Three days, huh?
This Jutsu is a Ninjutsuthat the Fourth Hokage passed on to us.
Huh...?
It took him three whole yearsto perfect this Jutsu...
This Jutsu is second from the top
on the six degrees ofdifficulty in mastering...
It's an A-rank, super high-level Ninjutsu.
In order to learn this move,there are three steps in the training.
This "Water Balloon Breaking"is the first step.
It took the genius Ninja,the Fourth Hokage...
Three years...
There's no point in explaininganymore to someone
who can't even clear the first step.
Do the rest by yourself!
Take care!I'm going to return to the town.
I have to gather some information...
What will you do?
A-rank in degree of difficultyin mastering...
The Ninjutsu left behindby the Fourth Hokage...
I'm not gonna go back yet!
Huh...
So long... Don't go overboard with it.
Now, what will happen?
It's something to be concerned about...
Mister!
Why don't you stop by?
This month is our special service month.
Whoa! It's a special service month?
The more you visit,the more you benefit.
Here you go, a stamp card!
I'll give you lots and lots of service!
I'll come, I'll come!
Hey! Come on down, Shu!
Hey, hey, where is the toilet?
I don't have time to spend three years.
All right now!
T raining, once again today!I'm gonna work hard like a blaze!
Break! Break! Break!
Why won't it break?
Little Jiraiya, you're so naughty!
Men are all naughty!
Dang it!
Three days have passed sinceI got the tip from that Pervy Sage...
The rubber is stretched this much,but why won't it break?
What am I doing different fromthat Pervy Sage?
This is great! This is so great!
What the--?
Whoa, he stinks of alcohol.
I'm gonna eat now!
Huh?
What's the matter?
Oh dang it!
Darn it! Why is it like this?!
No need to learn a finicky hand sign!It's okay to be stupid!
He said that there's no need to forma hand signal, but...
Hey! That's not your toy...
This is it!
Hurry up and wake up!Hey, you Pervy Sage!
Uh... G-Good timing.
Why don't you bring me some water...
Water?
The first step is cleared!
Cleared...?
Well, let's have you show it to me.
All right! Watch it carefully!
Left hand?
Go!
All right! See that?! See that?!
You're sleeping!
Sorry, sorry.
I'm tired from the days and nightsof gathering information.
But that seems suspicious to begin with!
You still stink of alcohol too!
Nevertheless...
You rotate the water inside the water balloonthat you hold in your left hand
by repeatedly applying itwith your right hand...
It seems little strange of an idea, but...
You're an interesting kid.
You understood the trick pretty well.It's all thanks to me, though.
It's thanks to this guy!
Huh?
I realized after I saw this cat playingwith the water balloon.
He kept on flicking it withhis paw many times
and the water inside shockedin all different kinds of direction...
Then it came to me like "bingo!"
How did it come like "bingo"?
The time when the Pervy Sagefirst showed me breaking it...
I remembered how the water balloonsurface was not smooth.
Until then,I was always only rotating the water
in the one same direction...
I realized that the Pervy Sage'swater balloon was not smooth
because the water inside was rotatingin different directions.
And after doing it in my own way,it broke!
It seems it's still not possible for you
to rotate it violently with one hand, but...
I suppose you thought it outin your own way.
That's just what he expected of me!
Anyhow...The first step is complete for now.
All right!
Do you want to see it one more time?One more time!
Oww!
You used too much Chakra andit gradually reached the point
where there's burdenon the Chakra Network...
But the next one won't be like this!
Okay. Now, we will proceedto the second step.
Yeah!
It seems like we can finally gointo some serious training!
- Here you go!- Huh?
Rubber ball?Something like this again?!
Now, you'll break this one!
It's one hundred times harderthan the water balloon!
It's hard...
The first step is rotation,the second step is force.
Since there is no water inside,
it's more difficult to imaginethe rotation of Chakra,
so it becomes more difficultto rotate the Chakra as well.
That's true...
I'll leave that to your own judgment.
I need to learn a trick againto do this, don't l?
Well then,I'll go gather some information.
Hey! Wait, wait!
Let's train together forthe first time in a while!
I don't mind if you take a nap.
Don't depend on me!
You must have some kindof misunderstanding!
I did say that I'll teach you the Jutsu,
but I don't have the obligationto teach you every step of the way.
If you can't do it by yourself,then that's it.
Don't be childish forever...Become more respectable like a Shinobi!
Well, well then.
If you can at least teach me...the trick again...
Money!
Money... money... money...
W-What do you mean"be respectable like a Shinobi"?!
Even though you say that,you're an dirty and greedy adult!
You're not a respectable Shinobi at all!
It's way more difficult thanthe time with the water balloon...
A-And...
my hands and arms hurt.
Dang it! How many days am lgoing to be doing the same thing!
Second from the top inthe difficulty of mastering...
Don't depend on me!
You must have some kindof misunderstanding!
Dang it!
Hey, Naruto.
What did you come here for?
Go buy some food from the town below.
What?! Why me?
Hey you...
Even if for a while, you're stilllearning the Jutsu from me.
Here you go, thanks for waiting.
Thank you.
How dare he put on a master's faceonly at a time like this
when he doesn't teach me anything...
Dad, buy me some ice cream.
I want this one that cracks.
Here.
Why? I can eat all of it by myself.
Nope, when you get home,your mother will have supper ready.
Okay!
Hey...you know...
Huh?
Can you be around my trainingfor just a while...today?
I don't have time for that.
I have to immediately go to town.
Unless you think for yourself andget a grip of the trick for yourself,
it'll never work.
I thought I told you three weeks ago!
Don't be spoiled like a kid.You are a Ninja.
I know that withoutyour telling me!
Just thought I'd ask.
Hurry up and go,you Pervy Sage!
Oh no, little Jiraiya,you tell so many lies!
What do you mean?!Everything is true!
Dang it! It doesn't breakno matter how much I try...
I'm just dripping awaymy Chakra this way.
Also...
The more I increase the amount of flow,the worse the pain gets.
But... How do I say it?
If I don't go all out as ifto explode the Chakra,
it's not going to break!
That's it!
If I understand the amount of Chakrathat flows from the pain I feel...
Then I can bear the pain to the limitand all at once...
No, not yet...
Not yet!
Not yet...store it!
Now!
Oww!
Hmm... There seems to have beena little progress.
Humph!
I've still only opened a holeand it hasn't popped with a bang!
Hey, don't pretend to be so tough. Here!
You've done well,all on your own power.
It's so good!
Yes...
Oh yeah. Maybe we'll test a bit.
What, what?
Give me your right hand.
What's this?
A cycle of hardship, right?
Inside, we were crying, right?
But the one thing we won't give upis the dream we've chosen, right?
It's a secondary role,
a role in the shadows
But in reaching for that dream,
let us stay centered,let us stay true
Over and over,we hung on without giving up
Over and over,we kept coming back up
Over and over,we believed and dreamed
Over and over,we've seen fools
Over and over,we've stood in the shadows of others
Now, it's our turn...Let us bask in our dreams
He tells me"focus, focus, focus!"
But I've never been good at it, ever.
Speaking of concentration,
Iruka Sensei used to scold me oftenat the Ninja Academy
for my lack of concentration.
Oh... I would've listened to him betterif I knew this would happen.

The Third Hokage, Forever...
Sarutobi...
At the very least this sword...
It was a fitting end for somebody like you
who has masteredthe Way of the Shinobi.
It feels like my arms are burning...
Master Orochimaru!
This is where we call off our plan.
Release the Barrier.We'll head back.
- Yes!- Yes!
- Release!- Release!
The Barrier...!
It's released!
Where is Lord Hokage?
Let's go!
We won't let you get away!
Ninja Art: Spider Web Net!
An adhesive type of stringfilled with Chakra...?
Kakashi! They're on the move!Do we go after them?
No, wait, Guy.
That's right...
If you make a move withoutany data on the situation up there,
you will get caught inthe enemy's trap.
I'm totally aware of that.
But regardless of whetherthere is a trap or not,
we can't let the enemy get awayat a time like this!
That is the way of the Leaf Shinobi!
So...are you just going to watch?
Kabuto?
So you did know, after all.
So...what are we going to do?
It's about time thatwe made a retreat.
You're going to run awayfrom me again?
Right now...
if we show our cards,they're most likely going to be copied.
Then again,
it doesn't seem like you've completelymastered that eye like the Uchiha clan.
Well then...
Temari...
Kankuro!
I'm leaving Sakura with you.
H-Hey!
Why is...this guy so strong?
My existence will not disappear...
I will not disappear!I cannot disappear!
I told you not to talk to that guy!
Let's go.
Oh, there! That's him...
Go away!
Monster! Monster! Monster...!
You monster! Die!
That's him... Don't get involved, fool!
Don't look at him!
Go away!
To them, I'm just a relic of the pastwho they want to see disappear.
So what did I have in this life,why did I keep living?
And that time, I thought of myself that l...no, that is what I had to think.
And then knew thatit was the most painful thing.
That l... that my existence didn't matterto anyone else in the world.
D-Don't come any closer!
The pain of... being all alone...really is unbearable, isn't it?
The way you feel...
I don't know why,but I completely understand that it hurts.
But I've met people who arevery important to me now.
I won't allow those important people...to get hurt!
If not, I will stop you even ifthat means...that I have to kill you!
Why...?
How is it that you can fight so muchfor other people?
They saved me from the hellof being all alone.
They accepted me for who I was.
That's why... they are important to me!
Love is a heart that desires to servea precious person who is close to oneself,
to love and watch over that person...
Love...
That is why he is so strong?
That's enough, Naruto...
Sakura is okay.
This guy's Chakra musthave been depleted as well...
Sakura's sand crumbleda long time ago.
Oh, I see...
I've had enough... Stop here.
Gaara?
I've never seen Gaara in sucha weakened state before...
All right.
Naruto Uzumaki, huh?
LOVEOne of these days, even l...
Temari... Kankuro...
- Huh?- Huh?
Sorry...
D-Don't worry about it...
Rain...
The sky has started to weep as well...
We will begin the memorial service
for the Third Hokage,who lost his life in this battle,
as well as the other victimsof this battle.
It's started...
In the end,all we could do was just watch...
Why?
Why did Old Man Hokage have to die?
Why...?
It's already been a year...
It's not easy to laughhiding your sadness.
I heard from your teacher thatyou're the center of laughter...
I'm not sad at all!
It's a very honorable thing fora Shinobi to die doing their duty!
My dad and mom sacrificed their lives
to protect this villagefrom the Demon Fox...
They're heroes!
I am the child of the heroes!I'm not sad to be alone.
And besides, these are tears of joy.
It's all right.
I know that you're curled upholding your knees by yourself.
But you're not alone...
Huh?
The Ninja of the Hidden Leaf Villagehave the will of fire...
Will of fire...?
It's the strong will to protectthe Leaf Village.
As long as they have this will of fire,everybody in this village are all family.
Iruka... I wonder if you have it?
Yeah...
For Hayate...?
The Third Hokage's funeralhas already started. Make it quick.
You too, Kakashi, is it for Obito...?
If you're always thinking ofan excuse for your tardiness,
you should just come earlier.
I do...from early in the morning.
It's just that,whenever I come here
I just want to punish myselffor being such a fool in the past.
Humph...
Shinobi, no matter what kindof situation they are in,
cannot show their emotion.
You must always prioritize your mission,
and never shed a tear inany kind of situation...
Iruka Sensei...
Hmm?
Why do people risk their own livesfor other people?
When one person dies...
their past, their present life, and their futuredisappear along with them.
Many people die doing their dutyand fighting in battle...
And shockingly easily, too.
Hayate was one of them.
Those who pass away alsohave dreams and ambitions.
But everyone has something else,just as important.
Parents, siblings, friends, lovers...Those who are dear to them.
They trust each other and help each other,
the people whom they've cherishedsince the day they were born.
And that string which connectsthose people
becomes stronger andthicker as time goes by...
It can't be explained by logic...
Those who hold those strings just do it,because it's important to them.
Yeah, I kind of get it.
But...
It's tough to die.
It's not like he just died for nothing.
He left us something very important.
Well, you'll eventually understandone of these days.
Yeah, I kind of get that too!
The rain's stopped.
Bye! Iruka Sensei!
Yeah...
Lord Third Hokage,the will of fire you spoke of
seems to have been passed onto the young Leaves.
The flame in their heartswhich you lit
will burn bright and strong...
And it will shine upon this village,and watch over and protect us.
It will become a new Hokage...one of these days...
They did manage to avoid annihilation,
but it seems the damageis pretty extensive.
The village that was onceat the height of its glory...
How sad...
How unlike you.
You have lingering affectionsfor your old home?
Even you?
No, not at all.
A cycle of hardship, right?
Inside, we were crying, right?
But the one thing we won't give upis the dream we've chosen, right?
It's a secondary role,
a role in the shadows

Over and over,we hung on without giving up

Over and over,we've stood in the shadows of others
Now, it's our turn...Let us bask in our dreams
The ritual ends, and morning mistwill be covering all soon.
Silence...
In that white mist,the shadow quietly sharpens its fangs.
It awakens childhood memory,disappointment, ire, and resolve.

Is everybody here?
- Y es, sir!- Y es, sir!
Big Brother Omasa,we're missing one!
What? Who is it?!
It's Idate! Morino Idate!
Darn, he's such a hopeless kid!
What should we do?Shall we wait?
We have no choice...
What the--?!
Who is it?!
You people are from the Wasabi Familyof the Land of Tea, correct?
Who are you!
You should know your place.
Hooligans like you peopleare no match for a Shinobi!
Please don't worry.I won't take your lives.
If you've learned from this,
you should give up the raceat Todoroki Great Shrine.
Blast it!
I have to at least deliver this letterto the Hidden Leaf Village.
OK! Mission! Mission!I'm so eager to do it!
But Kakashi Sensei is not here.
Is he late as usual?
No, Kakashi will not be coming.
It's Old Lady Tsunade!
Don't call me an old lady!
Excuse me... Lady Hokage...
What do you mean byKakashi Sensei will not be coming?
As you three already know,
most of the Jonin including Kakashiare on different missions.
This time, the three of you will haveto execute the mission by yourselves.
This is a B-rank mission,escorting an important figure!
Escorting an important figure...
Of course,depending on the situation,
the mission has the possibilityof becoming an A-rank.
And, who are we protecting?
Don't know...
What do you mean"don't know"?!
In the neighboring nationof the Land of Tea,
they have a Dedication Ceremonyat the Todoroki Great Shrine
once every four years.
We've received a requestto escort the runner
who will be participating inthe race that will be held there.
But an assailant from the opponent's side
attacked the messengersbefore they arrived here.
Assailant?
Excuse me, but I still don'tquite understand the mission.
Well, you should get the detailsdirectly from Boss Jirocho.
Boss Jirocho?! Oh yeah!The boss from that time!
That's it.
Now that you three understand,depart immediately!
Get to the Land of Tea by today.Snap to it!
- Yes!- All right.
Okay!
Roger that!
I'm counting on you.
Mission! Help an Old Friendin the Land of Tea
Hey Sakura, aren't you hungry?
Well, a little bit...
Then it's decided!
And perfect timing!There's a teahouse right over there!
Hey, Naruto.
You're here...?
Aoi Rokusho has now arrived.
I had you go throughall that trouble,
but Jirocho of the Wasabidoes not know when to give up.
Is he still trying to take partin the race at Todoroki Great Shrine?
That's right.
And there's new informationthat they have also hired Shinobi.
I see...
Then next time, let's beat themto a pulp at the race...
Welcome!
Ma'am, I'll have sweet bean soup.
Then I'll have dumplings.
How about you, Sasuke?
Jelly...
All right, please wait for a moment.
Ninja from the Leaf...
I'm gonna work so hard!
Naruto, don't take unnecessary actionby yourself.
Oh, okay.
Having sweet bean soupwhen it's so nice outside.
The Ninja profession sureis carefree!
What did you say?
Things must really be peacefulfor the Leaf Village.
Such a dense-lookingbunch of guys...
What?!
Hey! I didn't know there wassuch a cutie here.
I take back that previous comment!
Ah... pardon me.
I'm Idate Morino.
What's your name, young lady?
Don't you talk to Sakurain such a familiar tone!
Sakura... That's a good name.
Hey, even a chance meeting is dueto karma from a previous life.
Why don't we talk about our future?
Huh? Talk about...the future?
I'm talking about you quittingthe Ninja life and becoming my bride...
Hey you! How dare youhit on her all of a sudden!
Don't be silly!
Just joking.
But hey, you fool!
Idate here hates Ninja!
If you wander aroundthe Land of Tea anymore,
there'll be a price to pay!
That's amusing! Bring it on!
Hey, Naruto!
Ridiculous! We don't have timeto waste on a hooligan.
Be quiet, Sasuke!
I'm not going to forgive a guywho makes fun of Shinobi!
I'm going to punish this guy...
Huh?
He's gone...
Impossible!I didn't even notice...
Where did that guy run away to?!
Here, thank you for waiting.
Dang it!
Thank you for your patronage.
What? Two bills?
This is...?
Oh, that kid who was here left,saying that you guys would pay.
That guy!How dare he make fools of us!
The sound of footsteps is far off...He has considerable speed!
He made us look like idiots!
I can't stay quiet.We have to chase him!
Missus, thank you very much.I'll leave the money here.
Thanks!
All the customers todayseem to be in such a hurry.
He has incredible speed.He must have trained very hard.
Who is he?
Doesn't matter, we're definitelygoing to catch up to him!
Stupid Ninja!
There's no waythey can catch up to me!
Owww!
Darn it... Swift Runner Idatemakes a mistake of a lifetime!
Serves you right!
You have some nerve,trying to run away from us.
I'm so sorry!
Huh?
I'm sorry...
I had my wallet stolen and was at a loss,then you guys showed up.
So I did that...
You kinda feel sorryafter hearing his story.
Then you should have said thatfrom the start!
Ow! Huh...?
What's this?
Don't touch it!
This is mine!
Wh-What the...?!
On your mark.
Get set...
Go!
Weights?
Try to catch me now, you idiots!
Hey! He escaped again!
That guy!
He simply doesn't get it!
Is he for real?
What a speed...!
No way!Even we can't catch up to him...?
That's it. We don't have a chanceof catching up.
Dang it! He'll get itwhen I see him next time!
All of you, thanks for coming.
Begging your pardon!Begging your pardon!
I was born and raisedin the Leaf Village in the Land of Fire.
I was bathed in birth waterat "Ichiraku Ramen."
My given name is Narutoand the surname is Uzumaki.
People call me--
Loser!
Loser...? Nah, not that!
You're funny as usual.
Boss Jirocho,you're looking good yourself.
Hey, Naruto!
That's okay.A boy should be this spunky.
The greetings seem to be done,so I'll get to the main topic.
The Fifth Hokage told us to getthe details of this mission from you.
Yes, in fact...
Do you know of the Dedication Ceremonyat the Todoroki Great Shrine?
To...Todo...what?
Well, make yourselves comfortable.
The legend goes...
A long time ago,in order to subdue a storm,
Ryuko's Jewels were dedicatedto the Todoroki Great Shrine
and the storm subsided.
It became a customary eventthat happens once every four years.
At first, it was just to dedicate the jewels,but several decades ago,
it became a festival in whichthe first-place runner
became the man of the year.
In recent years, the festival hastaken on another face.
For ages now,in this port town of Degarashi,
two families,the Wasabi and the Wagarashi,
have controlled local operationsand policed the town.
It's embarrassing,
but conflict between the two familieshas never ceased and
there have been numerous skirmishesover territorial rights.
As the struggle intensified,
the town residents became entangledand even got injured...
In order to put a stop to the conflict,for the first time,
there was talk of some kind of mediationin the presence of the lord.
And it was agreed that the power holderof the town
would be determined in a contestrather than through brawls.
So that contest is...
It is the Todoroki Great ShrineDedication Ceremony
that is held every four years.
Four years ago, the Wagarashieasily won by hiring a Shinobi,
and we have learned thatthey've hired a Shinobi again this year.
In order to counteract that,
we sent messengers tothe Hidden Leaf Village with a request,
but they were ambushed and attacked.
I beg you guys!
Please lend us your power.
We cannot afford to lose this raceto the Wagarashi Family!
Leave it to me!
And, who do you want usto escort?
Oh, so you'll take this job?
Did you call for me, Boss?
Oh, you guys know each other?Then that makes the story fast.
That might not actuallybe the case...
Boss Jirocho is an important person!
By rights, he shouldn't bowhis head to Ninja like you!
Even if he did bow his head,I'd flatly refuse to escort a guy like you.
Oh yeah?!
As if I'd go with some guy who camefrom who-knows-where!
"Some guy from who-knows-where"?!
I am the brilliant Ninja,aruto Uzumaki,
who will eventually inheritthe name of Hokage!
Hah! Hokage is no big deal!
Hah! The boss of hooligansis even less of a big deal!
You idiot! Boss Jirocho isa very honorable person!
The Hokage is a great Shinobi
who puts his life on the lineto protect the village!
Boss Jirocho is a very,very, very honorable person
who always puts his lifeon the line to protect the town!
Hokage is more, more,more incredible!
Even though it's a tourist resort,everything seems so expensive.
Sorry about that.It sure is expensive, isn't it?
Oh no, I didn't mean...
We actually don't want to sellat this kind of price,
but after the Wagarashi familycame into power...
P-Please forgive me!
How dare you?!
Do you know who you haveto thank to do business?
Are you actually thinking about turningagainst the Wagarashi Family?
N-Not at all.But I have to get paid...
You're slow to understand.
- Hey!- Yes, sir!
P-Please stop!
Huh! First of all, we'll destroy you...
Wh-Who are you?!
Get out of here before you get hurt!
- What?!- What?!
Please run away!
These people are fromthe Wagarashi...
It'll be fine.
- You punk!- Wise guy!
We'll let you go for today!
If you've learned your lesson,never defy us again, kid!
Or you'll pay whenwe see you next time!
- Y-You won't get away with this!- Y-You won't get away with this!
Young man...
Thank you very much.
What a refreshing feeling!
We definitely need Boss Jirocho'sWasabi Family to win the upcoming race.
Sasuke...
Yeah...
Boss...
Of all people,did you have to ask the Leaf Shinobi?
Don't sulk like that, Idate.
I'm not sulking.
It's just that...
Idate...
I believe in you morethan anybody else.
The rest depends on you.
Why don't you believein people a little?
Idate...
please run for this town.
I beg you!
Boss...
Okay.
Even in exchange for my life...
Wow, I didn't think it was goingto be this big!
But what kind of race is it?
I'll explain the course soa dummy like you can understand.
The starting point is Degarashi Port.
After the start, you head forModoroki Shrine which is the midway point.
This is Modoroki Shrine...?
Yes... It seems the fastest wayto get to Modoroki Shrine
is to use a boat from here.
Then you take one of two Ryuko's jewelsfrom Modoroki Shrine and
dedicate that jewel at theTodoroki Great Shrine on Ouzu lsland.
That's the only rulefor the race.
So shortcuts, obstructions,and secret maneuvers are all allowed.
So hiring a Ninja is nota violation of the rule either.
Who are the Ninja thatthe other side hired?
They're hiding somewhereand checking the situation.
Don't be careless, Naruto!
R-Right!
You guys can just relax and watch.Don't follow me around!
What?!
I'm saying I don't wantan impediment.
You!
Calm down.Let's join forces here.
- Not with a guy like this!- Not with a guy like this!
They seem to strangely bein harmony, these two.
All right, everybody!
The Todoroki Great Shrine Racewill start soon!
Wasabi Family's runner,Idate Morino!
Idate...Morino?
Wagarashi Family's runner,Fukusuke Hikyakuya!
On your mark!
Start!
All right! We're going too!
Wh-What the--?!
Is he running away?!
Where are you going, Idate?!
Hey, wait!
Wh-What is he doing...?
Wait!
I believe your promise,its a true heart give me courage
Always I feel itthe precious time with you
On your still shoulder
I feel the wind that blowstowards tomorrow
The city lights are like pieces of stars
That hold us together
"Each one of us glows differently, "
you say laughingly
but you look most dazzling
Like a comet,
like the rainbow after the storm
You bring light into my heart
Being lost can be the answer
Let's promise we won't cheat
Uh...like a shooting star,we do go ahead.
What the heck is he thinking?!That idiot!
So fast. He's moving atan incredible speed.
Darn it! The opponent's alreadyfar out at sea!
This is bad!
If the distance between them getsany greater, it'll be impossible to win!
That idiot!
- Kick it up a notch, Sakura!- Right!
We're gonna bring him back at all costand make up the difference!
Next time: "The Race is On!Trouble on the High Seas!"

As for me...I stand by my words.
That's... my Way of Ninja!
If you die, there will be no dreams,no nothing!
Just get out of the way!Run away!
Just like our wager,
I will definitely winthat unlucky necklace from you.
I...
I will absolutely not dieuntil I've become Hokage!
This way, I can hold on to you.Here I go!
I-It can't be...
The Fifth Hokage!A Life on the Line!
Rasengan!
This is...?!
Way to go, Naruto.
That Nine-Tailed Fox kid...
a kid like that,doing a technique like that...
I-It can't be...
He can't be, really...
In only one week,that Rasengan...
You... Even after you receivedthat Jutsu...?!
I gathered the Chakra in my stomach,
and before I received the JutsuI had started healing.
The reason why Orochimaru favors me...
is not because of my use of Jutsuor my sense for Jutsu...
It is because my recuperative power.
The power to energize cellsand make new cells.
On the other hand...I've used up almost all of my Chakra.
That Jutsu...seems it was Naruto's last effort...
Wh-What?!
I-It can't be...
Even with my powers of recuperation,this much damage.
I don't...have...enough Chakra.
Arrhythmia!
Drats! His heart muscle is in tatters...
Why did that happen...?
That moment?!
At that moment of release...
did he shred the musclesaround his heart...?
Stop shaking!
Hey, Big Brother Gamakichi.
Are we really getting a snack?That guy looks like he's going to die.
You're annoying! Be quiet!
It's all over...for Naruto.
I... cut... his heart's Chakra Networkwhich restores the strength...
through the Nine-Tail's Chakra...
With all my strength.
In order to eliminate the possibilitythat he would heal with his own power.
There's no way he can recover...
Even with you.
Shut up!
I'll kill you later...
He's stopped breathing...!
Dammit!
Dammit!
Dammit!
It's dark...
Dark...
Why is it getting dark?
My strength is... Why...?
What...?
Don't die...
Don't die!
Don't die!
Don't die!
Don't die!
The bet...
I won it.
I-It's impossible...
"Hokage is... my dream," eh?
For the last time...
For the last time...
Just one more time...
I want to bet on you...
That child, he's not well...
Tsunade is a medical specialist.
Don't worry, there's no need toworry about Naruto's body.
That's not what I meant.
What?
Your battle is with me,there's no time to look away.
Who would have imagined this?
If that child is found by the Akatsuki,there will be trouble.
In other words,if I'm to kill him...
now is the time!
Shoot!
He's aiming at this child!
Tsunade... You're the only oneI wasn't going to kill...
If that child lives,
there will be trouble in the futureon a variety of levels.
Don't get in my way.
This is one child...
This is one child...I will absolutely protect!
Trembling at the sight of blood,why would you, one of the Sannin,
risk your life to protect that Genin kid?
To protect...
my hometown...the Leaf Village...!
To protect the Leaf Village...?
Because...because...
this small child...
is the kid who will becomeHokage some day...
What utter nonsense...
By the way...to hell with Hokage!
Only a fool does that job.
To hell with Hokage!Only a fool does that job.
The wishes of the two...
More importantly, Lady Tsunade,your wish...
Have you forgotten your dream?
The successive lines of Hokagehave protected
the Leaf Village andand those living in it.
They brought troubled times under controland helped the village to prosper.
They risked their livesfor this dream, this ideal!
Anyone who makes fun of the old manand the Fourth Hokage...
It doesn't matter ifyou are a woman!
I'll clobber you with all my might!
And now,I also will put my life on the line!
If your life is worth throwing awayfor a kid like him...!
Then dying now would bea fitting end!
All that's left... is Naruto.
Lady Tsunade!
Make it in time!
She's still able to move evenafter I pierced her down to her lungs!
You mean you'll still protect that kid?!
That's what I said...
From now...
I'm putting my life on the line!
You, half-dead corpse!
No matter how cool you try to be,your trembling doesn't stop.
You can't get away fromthe curse of hemophobia.
And yet, why would youtake the blows for that kid?
Why would you battle for the Leaf?
No way!
Tsunade's trembling has...
has stopped?
That is because... I am...
the Leaf Village's... Fifth Hokage!
That sign is?!
Lady Tsunade has conqueredher fear of blood,
but that's...
What are you saying you'll do,after all this time?
You can't fight with that woundeven if you've conquered your fear.
W-Wait! I'll treat that wound.So don't release that seal!
Tsunade: Release the Secret Seal!
Ninja Art: Mitotic Regeneration!
What is this Jutsu...?!
It looks like I'm not the only onewho develops new Jutsu.
What in the world is this Jutsu?
Well...
For many years I've stored Chakrain my forehead.
The mass of Chakra stimulateda variety of proteins.
The number of times my cells dividespeeds to a dizzying rate...
The cells rebuild...
and all the organs and body systemsare revitalized.
It's not the ability to restore,it's the ability to reincarnate.
That means I won't die...from battles.
But the number of times a person's cellsdivide in their lifetime is fixed...
If that is sped up,it essentially shortens the life!
Lady Tsunade!
That action is...
Lord Orochimaru!
Come out!
Hurry!
Ino, inu, saru, tori, hitsuji!
- Summoning Jutsu!- Summoning Jutsu!
I believe your promise,its a true heart give me courage
Always I feel itthe precious time with you
On your still shoulder
I feel the wind that blowstowards tomorrow
The city lights are like pieces of stars
That hold us together
"Each one of us glows differently, "
you say laughingly
but you look most dazzling
Like a comet,
lilke the rainbow after the storm
You bring light into my heart
Being lost can be the answer
Let's promise we won't cheat
Uh...lilke a shooting star,we do go ahead.
The time to conclude this long, fatefulconfrontation has come, Orochimaru.
You have sunk too deeply into vice.
You are no longer a comrade!
Comrade? How odious.
That word makes me shiver.
I will bring you down!
Today is the last day thatwe are called Sannin!
Next time:"Deadlock! Sannin Showdown!"Press down hard on the gas
That's right, there's no compromise
We'll slip through the night
At the final moment push hard
That's right, all the way to zero,
Until we wipe away the days
Gently open your heart
If you pull it close to you
It will reach you, without a doubt
It will come, closer
Now
We're speeding through life,squeezing it for all of its worth
Our feet are tied
But we still keep going farther
Even if I take it back, and grasp it
If you're not the one
There will be no meaning
And so we'll go far off into the distance.

Now, let the tenth round begin.
Do your best!
Fatso!
Damn it!
Those two better watch out!
I'll end this match quickly andturn you into mincemeat!
Then let's not play around...
I'll finish you off quickly, Mr. Fatso.
You bandaged cucumber roll!
I know his Achilles heel all too wellfrom my last battle with him.
Those holes in his arm emita pulsing sound, so...
Ninja Art!
Expansion Jutsu!
Followed by theHidden Leaf-style Taijutsu!
All I have to do is to prevent himfrom aiming at my ears!
Human Boulder Jutsu!
Hooray for Big-Boned!
Good!
Squash him, Choji!
This guy can attack sonically withouteven touching the opponent...
But that's only when ears are showing!
With Choji's whole head buried,it's like he's wearing ear plugs.
how does anyone make a sonic attackon a meat ball,
let alone one that's rolling?
The way you are...you can barely move, can you?
That's where I attack!
It's no use, I'm wearing ear plugs.
No, this is the end!
Oh?!
The human body is made up of 70% water,and water is able to transmit sound waves.
In other words, your whole body is likeone big ear.
And the winner is, Kinuta Dosu!
Lord Orochimaru...no, Orochimaru!
I'll have you know that...I'm more than a mere guinea pig.
Are you all right?
I-I want to eat meat...
Oh man...And the guy went easy on him, too.
Although he lost, the least we cando for him is take him for some BBQ beef.
It's finally over.
At long last, the Final Round...
With this, the preliminaries forthe third exam is completed.
A Shadow in Darkness:Danger Approaches Sasuke
I wonder what's happened to Naruto?
Let's go outside now.
Iruka Sensei hasn't been alert recently,so now's our chance.
Hey!
Konohamaru!
You intend to sneak out again, do you?
I-I need to go to the bathroom!
Liar!
To everyone who has advanced tothe Final Round
of the third test of the Chunin Exams,
there's one person who's missing,but, congratulations.
Sensei...
Hmm?
I have a question.
About Sasuke?
Well, I'm sorry, but I don't know much.
But don't worry too much.
From here on, it's up to Sasuke.
Sakura, I have to step outfor a moment.
Please inquire about thedetails of the Final Round!
Sure.
Here, in our house,including Sasuke who's not here,
we have five Leaf,
three Sand,
and one Sound.
Well, I will begin the explanationof the Final Round.
Finally!
The preliminary battles haveended without incident.
It seems they're now enteringthe Final Round.
This land really has becomepeaceful, hasn't it?
This peaceful time has putthis country in slumber...
while all the other lands are busy racingto expand their military.
Would it be possible for usto take it now?
Humph, I suppose.
Though, I don't know how much funit would be to take out that old man.
Is that so?
To me, it looks like you are still havea hesitation about it.
From now on, the power ofeach Hidden Village will clash
with one another in a longand violent manner.
The Sound village is also one of them...
You intend to be the triggerfor all of that...
And use him for a bullet.
Our Sasuke... right?
You guess well.
So well that it's a bit creepy.
Not in the slightest.
I still had no idea aboutDosu, Zaku or Kin.
In gathering information on Sasuke,
I desired to learn their skills
and carried out tactless things likedeliberately subjecting myself to an attack.
You overestimated me.
It seems that you...
you don't trust me completely... yet.
Was it necessary to tell you,my right-hand man,
about the likes of those three?
You see, therein liesthe very proof of my trust.
And because I do...
I would like to leave Sasukein your hands.
The Curse Mark that was given to him...
appears to have been sealed by Kakashi.
Though, that won't matter much.
While there is still somedarkness left in his heart...
I want you to abduct him.
That's an uncharacteristicallyhasty request, is it not?
There's a little something troubling me...
Is it Naruto Uzumaki?
You're quite a sharp one,aren't you?
Sasuke has lived for revengeagainst his older brother Itachi,
and will not rest until hehas achieved that aim.
Nevertheless, in battle with me,
he was aware that there were thingsbeyond his power and
faced death without fear.
I didn't think he'd be the type ofperson who would be in a hurry to die.
According to your information,
contact with that Nine-Tailed kid hasaltered Sasuke's heart and mind.
So much so, that he possessessome influence over Sasuke.
The best thing to do is to get Sasukeaway from him immediately...
And quickly turn him in my color.
Well, then...
Kabuto...
You...
If you wish to stop me...
You have no choicebut to kill young Sasuke, now.
You can't possibly kill me...
Though you are strong, you're onlyin the same league as Kakashi.
Just kidding...
Now, run along.
I trust you.
That face...
I wonder what could possiblybe going on in his head?
The Final Round is whereeach one of you
will show off your battle skillsin front of everyone.
I want you to satisfactorily demonstrateand show off your ability
as representative battle forcesof your respective lands.
Accordingly, the Final Round willcommence one month from now.
W-We're not going todo it here, right now?
This is so that there'sa suitable period of preparation.
What do you mean?
That is to say...
Along with the announcement ofthe conclusion
of the preliminary match to eachcountry's Daimyo and Shinobi leaders,
readying the summons forFinal Round requires preparation time-
not to mention the time it takesfor you examinees to prepare.
This old man always has sucha roundabout way of saying things.
I don't quite get whatyou're trying to say.
What do you mean?
In other words,in order to know your adversary,
in order to prepare yourself,time is necessary.
Time to analyze what you learned aboutthe adversaries in the preliminaries...
time to take stock of your successes.
The battles until now werelike actual battles-
it presupposed situations in whichyou can't know your adversary.
That's for sure...
I never dreamed that this guycould make sand into a weapon.
However, this is not the casein the Final Round.
Some of you might have alreadyrevealed everything in front of your rivals...
In the spirit of fairness and equality,
you will have a month totrain yourself to further your skills.
Now, I can't be thinking of this
as some sort of month-longholiday and do nothing! Believe it!
Seriously! Seriously!
It might not be good idea toexcel too much, is it?
We failed to stay out of Orochimaru'swatchful eye,
and it was unfortunate for us both.
Under this gentle exterior,a seed of evil took root -
and it was this seed that was exploited...
Someday, through that Ninjutsu...
this child will as well...
Kabuto...
Who knows?
Perhaps he really will kill Sasuke.
I have to give it you, Kakashi...
Stopping my attack from your blind spot...
But, you'd better ready at least10 of your men next time.
The Anbu that I prepared weretaken out without difficulty...
You're not an ordinary Genin are you?
You caught a whiff of me and immediatelyreadied your weapon...
you're quite impressive.
No, I'm not all that.
What do you want with Sasuke?
Depending on circumstances,I'll haul you off to questioning.
I wonder if that's possiblefor the likes of you...
Are you looking to take me on?
You are the son of the chief of theLeaf medical corps, aren't you?
Your name, was it, Kabuto Yakushi?
Are you affiliated with Orochimaru?
If you arrest me here now,
you might never be able to provemy connection to Orochimaru.
Shut up and confine your answersto my questions.
What if I say "No"?
I'm the one asking thequestions around here.
Now give me some answers.
You'll find out before long anywayif you let me go,
so can you make an exceptionjust this once?
You, willful little brat...
Don't mess around with grown-ups.
Don't be so arrogant.
The circumstances are in my favor...
I should have known.
A shadow clone!
Darn... I've let him escape.
Impressive...
As I suspected...
This is the Dead Soul Jutsu,
where one temporarily animatesand controls the heart of a dead body.
Meticulously transforming even the face...
and also stopping his heartbeatsand eliminating all traces of his body odor...
in order to prepare an escape byimpersonating a murdered Anbu...
He wasn't raised as the adopted son ofthe chief of the medical corps for nothing.
If someone this good is workingfor Orochimaru...
I can't stay as I am now...
Now that that's done...
I'd like to let you take your leave...
But first, for the Final Round,
there is one more importantmatter to take care of.
Let's get on with it,so we can get to training!
Now, now. I want you all tocalmly take one slip of paper
from the box that Anko is holding.
I'm going to go around in order...take only one.
Good, everyone has takena number.
Then, from left to right, tell methe number on your slip of paper.
I'm eight.
I'm one.
Seven.
Five.
Three.
Nine.
Two.
Six.
In other words, he has number four.
Uh-huh.
Very well, I will tell you
about how the Final Roundtournament will work.
Huh?
Is that what thesedrawing lots were for?
Ibiki, bring forth the pairings.
Yes, sir.
He's so far away.
Is that all the Final Round is,a tournament?
Shoot! I have one extra round.
Vendetta for Choji?Give me a break!
I'm so relieved to know thatI won't be in the same section as Gaara.
Sasuke Uchiha...
Perfect.
Hyuga Neji, right off the bat?
This couldn't be better!Believe it!
Sasuke has to go up against him...?
Could I ask a question?
Go ahead.
Does this mean that there willonly be one winner of the tournament?
That only one of us will beable to become a Chunin?
No, on the contrary.
The judges of the Final Round,of which I am one,
will be made up of the Kazekage,
the Daimyo from various countrieswho will assign you your missions,
and the Shinobi Leaders.
Through this tournament,
these judges will be able to makea thorough evaluation,
and come to a decision as towhether each one of you
possesses the qualities incumbentof a Chunin.
Even if someone loses the first round,they can still become a Chunin.
So there's a chance that allof us will become Chunin?
Correct, but conversely,there's also a chance that none of you will.
To "advance" in the tournament,
means maximizing chancesto appeal yourselves to the judges.
Understood, Shikamaru?
This is all a real pain in my...
Thank you for your patience.
We will adjourn until next month.
The second round will either beo Eyebrows from Sand or Sasuke, huh?
That guy is so strong he kickedBushy Brow's butt.
Sand Coffin!
I want to fight you, too.
Now that it's come to this,I've got to see Kakashi Sensei.
Umm, where's the roomthat Sasuke's in?
I'm sorry. Mr. Sasukeis not allowed visitors.
What?! Hey, hey!What's up with that?!
I'm sorry, those are the rules.
Why, Sis, tell me why?
Naruto, this is a hospital.Keep it down.
Kakashi Sensei!
Say! Say!
I've got a favor to ask!
You don't need to say it all.
Well, I thought it wouldcome to this so...
I searched for someoneto watch your training.
Why?! I want you to, Kakashi Sensei!
I have some matters to take care of.
I don't have the time to troublemyself with you.
Oh! Aha...!
You're going to trainSasuke, aren't you!
Well, don't say that.
I found a sensei who'smore reliable than I am!
Well...who is it?
It's me!
Huh?
You!
The Closet Perve!
Such insolence!
Hey, can you hear it?
The clear, blue sky goes on and on
The ocean spans limitlessly
Please keep that smile on your face forever
Or else I'll cry
You won't have to search around you
It's all ok now.
Everyone is insidethis hand
when you want to cry,and you want to run away
When you forget what happiness is
Just sing.
Light is born, and darkness was born
The two are one
Harmonia, feel the telepathy
Hey, can you hear it?
Darn! I'm not satisfied with this!
I don't care if you're elite tutoror whatever,
but there's no wayI'm not going to get stronger
if I 'm to learn from the Closet Perveweaker than me!
I have to get strong by anymeans necessary, no matter what!
If you're really a strong ninja,
just try to convince mewith your sheer strength!

Okay! Let's go!
Huh?
"Let's go,"with so much energy...
Don't act like a little kid!
Oh? You're in a bad mood.
Because! Because!It's in the middle of my training!
There are three stepsin the training, right?!
I'm only done with the second step!
You can do the third stepeven while walking.
What! Really?!
A balloon?
Here!
What's this...?An ordinary balloon?
The first step is "Spin."The second step is "Power."
And finally, the third step is this.
An Impossible Choice:The Pain Within Tsunade's Heart
Which one is "this"?!
Watch me, it looks as ifI am simply holding a balloon...
You say it "looks as if,"but nothing is really happening.
Then, I will do the same thingon my left hand.
Let's see what's really happeninginside the balloon.
Wow!
The Chakra is randomly spinningand going faster and faster...
But still, it's perfectly round...It's almost like...
Like a small typhoon, right?
What's happening in your left hand...
is happening inside that balloonin your right hand, too?
Yeah! That's right.
Cool...
The balloon isn't moving at alleven if he's spinning that much Chakra...
There's more power thanthat time the rubber ball popped,
and it's spinning a lot more too!
Listen, in this third step,
you've got to use 100% ofwhat you have learned...
and retain them.
In other words, while keepingthe "Spin" and the "Power" at their max,
imagine creating a single layerwithin the balloon
and compressing the Chakra within it.
Got it!
So, this training is about keeping
the spin and power that I didin the second step,
and conversely,trying not to pop a delicate balloon!
Oh! That's the most perceptiveyou've been so far!
Huh?
But, what's the point in goingto all the trouble?!
In short, it means this.
Watch! It's like this up untilthe second step of the training.
Next, after you have masteredthe third step!
This is what happens!
If you can keep this small typhoonthe size of your palm,
the force won't disperse.
The spinning gets faster and faster
and the power getsmore and more compressed.
And the destructive powerwill reach its max.
Well, so, that's that.
All right! I'll do this, too!
Okay, this feels right...
Now!
Retain it here!
Retain...
Retain...
No cutting-corners!
You've got to put out 100% spin and power,and retain them.
You gotta be kidding...
Unless I can perfectly control all my power,it's impossible!
Now I can see it...
This third step...
It's on a totally different levelcompared to the others.
I told you...
With an achievement difficulty of Rank A,it's a super advanced Ninjutsu.
Well, I'm done explaining!We'll continue as we go on walking.
Hey, hey!
We don't need to rush so much,until I can properly...
We have already wasted enough timewaiting for your body to recover.
There's no guarantee thatTsunade stays in this town much longer.
What?!
But, but...
It's not like an old acquaintanceis going to conveniently pop up
and start talking aboutthe good old times with her...
Come on, let's go!
All right...
Long time no see...Orochimaru.
I'd looked for you everywhere.
What do you want from meafter so long a time?
You aren't thinking of talkingabout the old days...?
Actually, I need to ask youfor a little favor...
His heartbeat is fast...
From that complexion,he must have a high fever.
He must have been fatiguedfor quite some time...
And that arm...
Lady Tsunade.
You must have understood by now.
Go to someone else,I don't treat anyone any more.
That won't do...
You must know how seriousthis wound is...
No one can treat this wound.
Except for one of the Legendary "Sannin"
who won her fame asa medical specialist, Princess Tsunade...
You...
That arm...it's not an ordinary wound.
A special Sealing Jutsu or something...?
What have you done?
Well, it just happened...when I killed the Third Hokage.
You... Really?
Humph. Don't look so scary.
Anything that has a formwill one day decay...
Same goes for humans.
You must already know that too.
For you have let two ofyour most beloved ones die...
Let two of the most beloved ones die?
I see... He thinks of terrible things.
That was a really terrible way to die...
You!
Poisoned...
She's fast!
Get out of my way!
Won't let you!
Calm down, Shizune!
This attendant...is an expert.
Orochimaru...
Your personality's been like thisfor a long time.
And you know my personalityvery well...
So stop fooling around with me.
I'll kill you, bastard!
She's powerful...
And so scary...she definitely must be single.
Tsunade is impatient and short-tempered...
Hey Naruto,there's no time to be falling.
If we don't hurry,
who knows where that shrewwill disappear again.
Hey you, Pervy Sage!
That's no way to speak toa hard-working apprentice!
Shut up. Tsunade is the first priority now,not you.
Well, what the heck!
To have this Pervy Sage comeall the way to meet her...
Who could this Kunoichi Tsunade be?
Hope she's still here...
We didn't come here to fight.
We just want to negotiate with you!
Negotiate?
Y es.
Don't make me laugh!
I've already told you once.Get out of my sight!
We can't do that.
Get out of my sight.
You are the only onewho can treat Lord Orochimaru's arm.
Get out of my sight.
We're not asking you to do it for free.
Let's make a deal!
I'll count up to five.Leave before I'm done.
Or else, I'll make you disappear myself.
Please calm down.It won't be a bad deal for you...
Five...
Four...
Three...
Two...
One...
I'll resurrect the little brotherand man, both of whom you loved...
with the Forbidden Jutsu I've developed.
Since we haven't disappeared yet,
I'm guessing that the deal is made?
Yes. I do know this young lady...
Really?
Yeah.
To win back the money she lost here,I think she said...
she was going over there.
Spin... Power...
Letting them out to their maxand retain it...
Hey, kid.
Hmm?
Wanna gamble a bit, too?
Over there? Where is that?
Hmm?
See, if the total number of the pipson these dices
comes out as even numbers,that's "Cho"
and if it's odd, that's "Han."
Shut up! I am training right now,don't bug me!
What nonsense!This is a gambling house.
Instead of that balloon,let's play with these.
No way! I don't have any timeto be playing with those dice!
Ha, what a boring kid!
Shut up!
So...can you tell me where that is?
Well, you can't expect things to be freein a gambling house, you know?
Okay...
Let's make a deal.The information will be free if you win...
And if you lose,I'll give it to you for 1 000 ryo.
All right!
So choose, odd or even!
Okay! Here we go...
Well, so...since I am exactly 50 years old.
I'll go for...even!
If it's odd, I win...
I'll open it now.
Oh no! 2 and 5, odd!
W-What the heck--?!
1 000 ryo...
Nice, Naruto!
Looks like I won...
Darn! It didn't work again!
Retain...
Where shall I look next?
Geez, she's nowhere to be found!
Hm? Me?
Lotto?
Kids, grownups, everyone loves it.
Come and play withthis fun, fun Lotto.
There's one that you knowthe result right away.
Which one do you want?
Really, you are so much cuterbeing chubby!
I can't believe he wonwith just one draw.
He's very talented in this...
though his talent in Jutsuis still immature.
Well...anyhow...
Where could have Tsunade gone?
She couldn't have gone that farin this short amount of time.
I guess we'll have tosearch for her from a higher place.
If I remember it correctly,this is a castle town.
If we go up to the castle...
Naruto! This way!
Don't you want to see those two...Tsunade?
Nawaki...Dan...
If I treat your arms,what do you intend to do with them?
Well, I don't like to lie...
So, I will tell you the truth.
Hey, hey! Where is the castle?
It's not there...?
In addition to getting what I want...
This time, I will completely destroythe Leaf Village!
A cycle of hardship, right?
Inside, we were crying, right?
But the one thing we won't give upis the dream we've chosen, right?
It's a secondary role,
a role in the shadows
But in reaching for that dream,
let us stay centered,let us stay true
Over and over,we hung on without giving up
Over and over,we kept coming back up
Over and over,we believed and dreamed
Over and over,we've seen fools
Over and over,we've stood in the shadows of others
Now, it's our turn...Let us bask in our dreams
Hey, enough already!
Who cares if she is one of the Sannin?!
Who cares if she isthe legendary Kunoichi?!
Who cares if she'sthe medical specialist?!
There's no way I'll acceptthis person as the new Hokage!
If she belittles the Thirdand Fourth Hokages...
I don't care if she's the candidateto be the Fifth Hokage!
I'll kick her butt!

You go after Idate.
- Right!- Right!
Hey, Idate!The ocean is that way!
Where are you going!Come back!
Hah! There's no wayI'm going back!
Let's go!
Right!
What does that kid thinkhe's doing?
Looks like he's run away.
Idate's been like thatfrom long ago.
You know him?
Yes, kind of...
The Race is On!Trouble on the High Seas!
I knew he'd run away,that bastard Idate.
Knowing him this long,you must've figured this would happen.
It was a mistake to let him run!
You idiots!Idate isn't that kind of kid!
- Boss!- Boss...
I believe in Idate.
He must have a plan.
Jirocho!
Chief Retainer!
How do you thinkyou're going to settle this?
You've turned this grand traditionalfestival into a mere farce...
And worse,in the presence of the lord!
Sir, the race has just begun.Please watch it until the end.
Since you insist that much,you had better win.
If you lose...
I'll ask for the dissolutionof your family!
Agreed! I'm a man of my word.
If Idate loses,you may do anything you wish.
How like Wasabi's Jirocho.Such confidence.
Don't let us down.
I'm counting on you, Idate.
Boss...
Give me your money!
Just be still!
A starving thief, huh...
Sh-Shut up!
A kid trying to act tough!
With that little thing,
you can't even peel an apple,can you?!
Here!
Take this.
Edged tools aren'tfor hurting people.
You don't have anywhere to go,do you?
I'm Jirocho of Wasabiof Degarashi Port.
Wasabi... Jirocho?
How about it?Why don't you come to my place?
I-I just tried to...
Anyone on the verge of starvationwill make such mistakes...
I don't hold it against you.
Ah...this...
I gave it to you.Keep it.
Don't ever do stupid thingslike stealing...
M-Mister!
Listen!Make me your henchman!
No, I mean...could you please, Boss!
What's your name?
Idate...My name is Idate Morino.
Shall we go then, Idate?
Boss, just trust in me!I will win, no matter what!
We can catch upto him in a bit!
But it's too late now!
He can't win ifhe's this far from the port!
No, he may've planned to comethis way from the very beginning.
What?
Huh?
How lucky!
Now, we can stop them here.
At any rate...
who would've thoughtthey'd be escorting him.
Double Lucky!ow I can pay them back.
For what they did to usduring the Chunin Exams.
You two go ahead.I'll keep them here.
All right!
Finally, we've caught up to you!
Hey, wait!
Geez! Why on earthdid you come this way?!
Shut up!It's none of your business!
What kinda attitude is that?!
I said to shut up!
Watch out!
They aren't aware of it, are they?
Of Genjutsu?
Hey, I said wait up!
I've already been here?
Darn! Looks likeI've been tricked by Genjutsu.
Wha-?!
If that's the case...
Release!
There!
H-Hey!
No! Don't go that way!
Huh? What's going on?
I'm out of it!
Just be still!
We'll get pulled up now!
That was close...
A double Genjutsu.
Pretty elaborate trick.
You idiot! It's your fault thatwe're going through all this!
What did you say?!
Hey, stop! Stop, I said!
My Ninja tools!
That was an unnecessary help!
Did you say unnecessary?!
Hey bastard, can't you eventhank us for saving you?!
You saved mebecause it's your duty!
No need to thank you!
What did you say?!
Stop, Naruto. He's right.
But if you don't want to die,you should stay close to us.
Hey, where are you going?!
Aren't you going backto Port Degarashi?
Stupid, I'm heading north from here!
North? Is it faster that way?
Yeah...
Who knows...I really don't trust this guy!
This is why Ninja are no good.
What?!
At this time of year,
a strong seasonal wind blowsacross this ocean...
At the starting point, I watched the cloudsand realized it...
That the wind was coming.
On top of that,at the port to the north,
there's an ocean currentthat flows straight to Nagi lsland.
This part is different from you guys.Right here!
Looks like it's getting a bit rough.
Hey, don't push it!
Head more towards the south!
But that'll take up quite some time.
Once we get on the land,no one can run faster than I can.
My victory is already set!
All right...
I taste salt in the air.
It's the ocean!
What is it that far out on the ocean?
It's the halfway point --agi lsland where Modoroki shrine is.
I can get there within an hour.Wait for a sec.
Hey, old man, I'm here!It's Idate from the Wasabi Family!
Ah, I've been waiting for you.
Looks like I was right.
I'll need you to lend me a boat.
I see. I have it ready.
Use that boat.
It's the fastest boat around here.
I'm grateful to you!
No problem. Boss Jirocho has doneso much for me.
So, don't lose to Wagarashi!
I'm fed up with howthey handle things.
Leave it to me!
I may be down on my luck now,
but I'm Idate, the number onehenchman of the Wasabi Family!
Rest easy and leave it all to me!
Yeah, right.
We should start seeingagi Island's port soon.
I hope we can get therebefore Fukusuke.
Hey, Naruto...What do you think?
Hm? What about?
That Idate...
He's definitely notan ordinary man.
He can run extraordinarily fast.
He could have receivedspecial training...
What kind of training?
Like, maybe he'd beenin a hidden village.
A guy that stupid can't be a Ninja!
Who's talking here?!You're as stupid as he is!
B-But...
I made it to the final roundof the Chunin Exam!
You were in the final roundof the Chunin Exam?!
Yeah, that's right!
If I weren't interruptedin the middle of it,
I could have won the tournamentand become a Chunin!
Hah!
Then you must have hada darn easy proctor.
Really, the level ofthe Chunin Exam has dropped...
Oh!
Idate, so you are...
I remember now!
Idate Morino.
Morino... That's right!
Wasn't the proctorof the first test....?
Be quiet, you rotten runts!
Sorry to have kept you waiting.
I'm the proctor forthe first test of the Chunin Exam.
My name is Morino Ibiki.
Morino... Ibiki...
What did you say?
Brother I-Ibiki is alive?!
Yes...
Of course, he's alive!
He gave me a weird problemon the 10th question...
Is that true?He really is alive?!
Wh-What's this?!
An ambush!
How is it?
As you can see,it's right in front of us.
Then, let's get startedon our plan!
Darn!
Naruto and I will chase them away!
Sakura, take care of Idate!
Isn't it better to run...?
Too late for that!
I'll cover you. Remove the ropes!
Gotcha!
Darn! I have to cut these!
Darn it! I lost them all that time!
Hey, lend me that thing!
What?!
Just hand it to me, hurry!
Bastard, this is more importantthan my life.
There's no wayI'll let you use it...
This is no time to be sayingstuff like that!
S-Stop you idiot!
Hurry up, you loser!
Heh, piece of cake!
Sakura! They are just clones!
Only the real one can attack you,so don't worry!
Sharingan!
Sakura, Naruto!
The real ones are hiding amongthe clones! Be careful!
Sasuke! Guide us!
Idate, stay close to me!
Hah! I don't want a Ninja's help!
Are you still saying thatin this situation?!
Naruto! Behind you!
Naruto!
A clone?!
Oh, shoot!
- Clone for clone!- Clone for clone!
Damn, they got away.
Nice work! Naruto!
That Shadow Clone kidis troublesome.
The next plan, Kagari!
We'll kill them all!
Water Style!Black Rain Jutsu!
Sasuke! They've changedinto Water Clones!
I know!
Rain?
No! This is oil!
How annoying!I'll get rid of them all at once!
That's Tiger Seal!
Sasuke, no!
Oops...
Unlucky...
Humph, not really.
Fire attack?!
B-Brother...
Go! Having you stay will bea burden to me!
B-Brother...
Idate?
N-Nothing!
Sasuke, what can we do?!
If the fire is this strong...
We'll have to dive into the ocean!
From here, we can swimto the port of Nagi lsland!
Right! There's no other option left.
Idate, can you swim?
Y-Yeah...
Hurry! I'll cover you, so go first!
This smoke should help youescape unnoticed!
Idate?!
There's no way!
Wha--?
You are tricking me intobecoming a decoy!
What are you talking about?!
You're trying to getthe enemy's attention to me!
That's nonsense!
No! I don't trust Ninja!
What are you doing? Go!
Having you stay will bea burden to us!
Go! Having you stayis a burden!
Hurry up and go!
There's no way we willuse you as a decoy!
N-No...
Cha!
Idate! Duck down!
Trust me Idate!I promise I'll protect you!
Watch out!
Sa...!
Sakura!
S-Sakura...
Go on ahead...
We'll follow you right after!
A-All right...
Well, shall we withdraw now?
Withdraw?
The most enjoyable partis still left undone.
Darn, they areunexpectedly tenacious.
Yeah. But we won'tlet them get away.
I-I should be okay here...
Long time no see, Idate.
Y-You are...
I have taught you so many timesnot to trust anyone.
Such a fool, you are...
I believe your promise,its a true heart give me courage
Always I feel itthe precious time with you
On your still shoulder
I feel the wind that blowstowards tomorrow
The city lights are like pieces of stars
That hold us together
"Each one of us glows differently, "
you say laughingly
but you look most dazzling
Like a comet,
like the rainbow after the storm
You bring light into my heart
Being lost can be the answer
Let's promise we won't cheat
Uh...like a shooting star,we do go ahead.
Fool or whatever...It doesn't matter now how you used to be.
This race is not over yet!
You'll never know unlessyou try 'til the very end!
Boss Jirocho believes in you.
If you have time to stall and act cool,why don't you show some guts?!

Hey... don't you want to see it?
It's about time.
What?
You know what I'm talking about.
Kakashi Sensei's...real face!
What are you doing?!
That's stupid!
I'm not interested.
Today's mission is over,so I'm going home...
Yeah, I agree...
Aw geez... It sounds like fun.
Maybe he has...
lips like cod roe?
Lips like cod roe, lips like cod roe,
lips like cod roe, lips like cod roe,lips like cod roe...
Take one more push!
Or maybe a buckteeth?!
Buckteeth?!
Buckteeth?! Buckteeth?!Buckteeth?!
Gotta See! Gotta Know!Kakashi Sensei's True Face!
But this is rare...
Here you go! Thanks for waiting!
All three of you treating me...
Snow might fall--
- Great success!- Great success!
You know what I mean?
Here! Thanks for waiting!
All three of you treating me...
Snow might fall today?
Or if it's not that...
- Great success!- Great success!
Maybe it's that...
Here! Thanks for waiting!
All three of you treating me...
Snow might fall today?
Or if it's not that...
are you guys up to something...or not?
- Great success!- Great success!
... like that.
Or if it's not that,are you guys up to something?
Wh-Wh-What are you saying?!
K-Kakashi Sensei, we're celebratingyour release from the hospital!
N-Now! P-P-P-lease eat, eat!
All right...Then I'll eat it without hesitation.
Thank you for waiting.
The pork slices are our treat.
Thanks for the treat.
Oh! Sasuke...What a coincidence!
Get away! Ino Pig!
Wha--?!
Aw man! I can't see at all!
I'm finished! That was good...
- So fast!- So fast!
Huh? Something wrong?
N-Nothing's wrong.
Hey!
- Huh?- Huh?
- Wow! I'm really curious!- Wow! I'm really curious!
Now, I will not allow myselfto be denied a glimpse of him!
But how are yougoing to see it?
That's...
We'll see it somehow...
I'm asking you how! You idiot!
Then, then, do you havea good plan, Sakura?
That's...
We'll follow by completely marking him.
If we do that, he'll eventuallytake his mask off.
Sasuke, you are really bright.
What's that big deal?That was so average!
Did you say something?
Well, that's fine.
What's Kakashi Sensei doing?
I'm disappointed in him.
He noticed us!
Stupid Naruto!We were found because of you!
I tell you it's not my fault!
What?!
I-It's being made into a movie?!
I'm going to go buyan advance ticket.
Hey, he's begun to move!
We'll follow his track!
Yeah!
What? He's gone!
Darn, he got away...
Darn it, where did he go...?
What are you guys doing?
Do you guys havesome business with me?
- N-Not really...- N-Not really...
Hey, how did he find us out?
Isn't it because thereare too many of us?
If the presence is erased,the number of people shouldn't matter!
Or... have you forgotten the Jutsu?Sakura...
That's you!
It will be good training to shadow him.
From now on,we'll go about it individually.
Y-Yeah, let's just leave Naruto here!
What?!
And Junko then says..."Oh, I am losing you."
What? What?
He got away...
Clumsy as usual...
You idiot...
Sorry.
Gosh, what is Kakashi Sensei doing?
He hasn't moved forsuch a long time...
No way!
Sasuke! How did it go?!
No more shadowing.
Off we go!
Today's mission is to help at a farm.
The mission itself is not a big deal.
We're definitely going to look at it...
- Kakashi Sensei's real face!- Kakashi Sensei's real face!
What's the matter?
You guys seem to havelots of energy today.
- I have lots of energy!- I'm ready to go!
Oh, that's excellent.
I've finally found you...
Kakashi Hatake!
Kakashi...
It has been a long while,
but I will settlemy long-standing grudge!
Boss, what is your grudge?
Fool! Have you forgotten?!
I cannot forget.
It happened in the springof three years ago...
No!
You don't need to be that scared.
No!
Our boss says he has somethingto talk to you about...
Your boss?!
I love you... Please marry me!
- Boss is so cool!- Boss is so cool!
No...
There's no need to be embarrassed.
You can be honest andfly into my arms.
No...
Don't worry.Even though I look like this,
I have a tidy sum of money!
I am telling you, no!
What? You're turning me downin these surroundings?
When I say no, I mean no!
I made it such a romantic setting,but why?
I don't like what I don't like!
Why don't you stop it around there?
- Huh?- Huh?
Hey, the girl doesn't like itand no matter how you look at it,
you're being rejected, buddy.
Yeah, yeah.
You're pretty gutsy.
Do you understand who we are?!
Are you challenging us, knowing thatwe are the Moya Ninja Threesome...
fearsome enough to silencea crying child?!
Moya Ninja? Never heard of it.
You don't know Moya Ninja?!
How dare you make fools of us!
Who the hell are you?
It's not worth enough to introduce, but...
Well, my name is Kakashi Hatake.
- You're introducing yourself!- You're introducing yourself!
Hey you...
You're going to regret it.
For getting in the way ofsomeone's romance!
Romance?
Isn't it just an annoying,one-sided love?
Enough!
Men! We're going to attack!
- Yes, sir!- Yes, sir!
4... 3... 2... 1...
- Hustle! Hustle!- Hustle! Hustle!
Please! Somebody help me!
Hey! I can't stand heights!
I'll take you back to the village.
Stop talking! Hey!
Hey, quit sighing!What, are you just leaving us here?!
That's how it went...
- Don't be so proud!- Don't be so proud!
- You lost!- You lost!
So it means revenge fromthree years ago!
Boss has become strongerin the last three years,
and he's going to beat him upin a face-to-face match!
That's so dramatic!
Fool! Who would take such risk?!
Huh?
If we're going to do it,
we'll do it stealthily fromthe shadows! Stealthily.
- D-Dirty!- D-Dirty!
Welcome!
Welcome! Welcome! Welcome!
Welcome!
Incredible!
Looks delicious!
How extravagant.
Please take your time...
Kakashi...
Now eat, this will beyour last dinner party.
That meal containsa tasteless and odorless medicine
that causes uncontrollable hiccups.
Just keep on havingthe ceaseless hiccups and die suffering!
It's a fitting end for you!
Something wrong?
Not one of you haseven laid chopsticks on the food.
Not really, but why don't you,Kakashi Sensei, hurry up and eat?
Well, I'm on a diet.
Figured he'd say something like that.
Then I'll strip off that maskif it kills me!
My hands slipped...
How could you!
Oh, sorry, sorry, I unintentionally...
- What do you mean "unintentionally"?!- What do you mean "unintentionally"?!
What a pity! The meal...
- How could he do such a thing?!- How could he do such a thing?!
Hey, what's the next move?
Don't worry. I have an idea.
- An idea?- An idea?
I see, this is pretty good thinkingfor Sasuke.
A person would normallytake off the mask here.
Never mind that.Just be quiet, you idiot!
Kakashi, you will die here!
From this needle on the blowpipe arrow,
coated with medicine I preparedthat will make you laugh uncontrollably...
You'll die laughing...
That is the fitting way for you...
Darn...
I wanted to see it too,but this is a hot spring...
But I want to see!
Kakashi Sensei!Aren't you ready yet?
All right, I'm coming in now.
I do want to see it!
Here he comes!
Great!
Oh, I can't see at all!
Thanks for waiting.I'll just soak for a little while.
- Why is it like this?!- Why is it like this?!
Now!
Huh? Something wrong?
And slowly, I sink in.
What the--?!
What happened?I want to know!
What in the world isKakashi Sensei thinking? Huh?
Darn, I'm completely flushed... Huh?
- Our clothes are gone!- Our clothes are gone!
Please come again!Please come again!
Thank you for coming!
Please come again!Please come again!
Crap... I'm going todefinitely defeat you, Kakashi Hatake.
But it was great thatwe brought spare clothes.
I wonder who took them away...?Our clothes!
All right,each of you work at your own posts.
Now, break up.
I can't stand it anymore...
I have too much stress stored inside.
I'm almost at the end ofmy patience as well...
Sasuke... actually, me too...
Then, it's the last resort!
- Last resort?- Last resort?
What is this?
Can't you see? It's Shinobi outfit.
When did you get this ready?
Well, well, never mind that,never mind that.
What do you do with this?
We'll strip away the mask.Even if we have to use force!
Darn Kakashi...
Boss! Look at that!
Hey, Kakashi Hatake!
Hey, what are you guys up to?
W-What are you talking about?We are simply Ninja.
It is not that we want to seewhat is behind your mask--!
Fool! Don't say unnecessary things!
That's...!
Boss! There's somebody else besides youwho holds a grudge on Kakashi!
Now is the chance!
Right! Let's go!
- Right!- Right!
Stop right there!
Kakashi! It's time for youto pay for your crime!
You shall die!
With this medicine I preparedthat will make you cry... What?!
Oh, just when I thought how longyou guys were going to sneak around...
you finally come out.
Ah, well, you know...
But before that,Sasuke, Sakura, Naruto!
Why are you guys dressed like that?
Huh?! Well, yeah, so...
Oh no...
We have to make up an explanation,whatever it is!
Caught you!
We were well aware thatyou three were targeting Kakashi Sensei!
What?! Then our plot was exposedfrom the beginning!
Of course!This was a trap to lure you guys out!
We caught you off guard!
So we were completely caughtin the trap.
Darn! We underestimated you,thinking it was kids!
I never heard that story!
Nice, Sakura!
I don't quite get what's happening,but oh well...
- Please forgive us!- Please forgive us!
There's no use talking...
- O-Oh no!- S-Stop!
It's the same as three years ago!
This time, we're hung by just one rope,combined with the same movement.
By the way, who are you guys?
- And he doesn't even remember us!- And he doesn't even remember us!
Hey, Kakashi Sensei.
Yeah?
What is behind that mask?
What? You wanted to seewhat's behind this mask?
Yeah!
Then you should have saidthat from the beginning...
Well, can you show us?
I don't mind...
What the--?!
Sure thing.
All right...
Is it like cod roe?
Buckteeth?
Or a tiny mouth?
Behind this mask...
- Behind that mask...- Behind that mask...
There happens to be another mask!
- What?!- What?!
What--?!
What in the world is that?!
I believe your promise,its a true heart give me courage
Always I feel itthe precious time with you
On your still shoulder
I feel the wind that blowstowards tomorrow
The city lights are like pieces of stars
That hold us together
"Each one of us glows differently, "
you say laughingly
but you look most dazzling
Like a comet,
like the rainbow after the storm
You bring light into my heart
Being lost can be the answer
Let's promise we won't cheat
Uh...like a shooting star,we do go ahead.
Begging your pardon!Begging your pardon!
I was born and raised in the Leaf Villagein the Land of Fire.
My given name is Naruto,and the surname is Uzumaki.
People call me--
"The No. 1 HyperactiveKnucklehead Ninja"!
I'm not "the No. 1 HyperactiveKnucklehead Ninja"!
What's thisyou've been practicing?
We're going to meet withBoss Wasabi.
A proper first greeting's important!
Next time: "Mission:Help an Old Friend in the Land of Tea!"Press down hard on the gas
That's right, there's no compromise
We'll slip through the night
At the final moment push hard
That's right, all the way to zero,
Until we wipe away the days
Gently open your heart
If you pull it close to you
It will reach you, without a doubt
It will come, closer
Now
We're speeding through life,squeezing it for all of its worth
Our feet are tied
But we still keep going farther
Even if I take it back, and grasp it
If you're not the one
There will be no meaning
And so we'll go far off into the distance.

We now start the second testof the Chunin Exam!
Look for the brats!
Those three, right?
All right! Let's go!
Okay! First we search for that thing.Can you do it, Hinata?
Yes.
Slow down, Lee! We just started.
I know. But...
I can't stay still!
Who knows what kind ofpowerful foe is waiting for us?!
As you already understand,we have only one target!
It sounds like they've already started.
Huh? That was someone'sscream just now, right?
I-I 'm kinda getting nervous.
I-It was nothing, Sakura. Believe it!
I-I have to pee.
Y-You... Fool!
What are you doing in front of a lady!
Go to the grass!
Eat or be Eaten: Panic in the Forest
Oh...! Ohhh...!
Aaah... that was a lot!
Feels much better!
C'mon Naruto! I told you not to saythings like that in front of a lady--!
What?!
S-Sasuke...
no matter what,you don't have to go that far.
W-What was that for?
Where's the real Naruto?!
Huh?
I don't know what the heckyou're talking about!
What happened to the scratchyou got earlier from the Proctor?!
And... your Shuriken holsteris on your left leg.
That guy's right-handed.
You're worse at transformationthan Naruto, you phony!
Unlucky me! In that case...
Which one of you got the scroll?!
Since things have come to this,I'll resort to force!
Fire Style:Phoenix Flower Jutsu!
Heeeey! Sasuke!
You've got to be kidding, loser.
All right!
I caught you off guard! Lucky!
Paper Bomb...!
This is lucky!
I'll kill you if you move!Calmly hand over the scroll!
Sasuke!
I won't let you get away!
Y-You're always late Naruto!
Absorption with my Chakra.
Sasuke...
Don't just stand there, Sakura!
No guarantee this guy's alone!
Got it?!
If you let your guard downyou'll really get killed...
It's unlucky! I came on my ownto conceal my presence,
but that became my enemy...
He got away, huh...?
If there's an instance thatwe become separated,
don't trust him if he lookslike your teammate.
Just like now there's a possibility
that an enemy will transformto get close to us!
- Yeah.- So what do we do?
We'll decide on a password.
Password?
Listen, if the password is incorrect,no matter what he looks like...
presume he is an enemy!
I'll only say it once, so listen closely.
You ask,inja song, "Ninja Chance."
And the answer is this:
"The chance to sneak up when a largenumber of enemies are making a scene.
"The quiet place has no secret hideout.
"It is important for a Shinobito know the right time.
"The time when an enemy is tiredand drops his guard."
That's it.
Okay!
Could you say it again?
Huh?!
I told you I'd only say it once.
Could it be that you couldn't memorize it?
- You fool!- Huh?!
I got it right away!
I-I memorized it perfectly!
I thought just in case,I'd listen one more time...
I'll carry the scroll!
Hey, wait Sasuke.
Ouch!
What is it?
A new enemy?!
You guys go play around...
I'll go alone...
Sakura!
Sasuke!
Don't come closer!
First the password...
Ninja song, "Ninja Chance"!
Ah! Umm...
The chance to sneak up where a largenumber of enemies are making a scene.
The quiet place has no secret hideout.
It is important for a Shinobito know the right time.
The time when an enemy is tiredand drops his guard.
Good.
Owwww!
Hey everyone, are you okay?
Naruto, wait!
The password...
I know...
The chance to sneak up where a largenumber of enemies are making a scene.
The quiet place has nosecret hideout.
It is important for a Shinobito know the right time.
The time when an enemyis tired and drops his guard.
- What?!- Huh?!
What are you doing?!
This time it's someone whocan dodge my attack, huh?
What are you saying, Sasuke?
Naruto just saidthe password properly.
He was able to say it,that's the problem!
- Huh?!- Wha--?
Do you really think that guy canremember a password that long?
Oh!
If we asked the normal Narutowhat the password is,
what do you think he'd say?
"Sorry. I've forgotten it."
Besides, his movements whenhe avoided my attack...
It was clearly differentfrom Naruto's!
Show your true self already,fake one!
That's how it is, huh...
But if you knew he would forget it,
why didn't you makethe password shorter?
I knew that you wereunderground
eavesdropping onour conversation.
So I chose that password on purpose.
Oh really. So you're not tiredor letting your guard down.
This will be more fun than I thought.
This person's...too creepy!
And where's Naruto?
Huh?
Owww!
And heave!
Huh? Where are Sakuraand that Sasuke?
H-Huge!
This is the first time I've seen...a snake this huge!
Behind?!
T-Tail!
You want our Earth Scroll,don't you?
'Cause you have the Heaven Scroll.
Well, let's begin...
the battle for the Scrolls.
Life or Death!
Genjutsu?!
No, that's not it.
This is simplya thirst for blood.
What's going on?
Just looking at her eyesmade me think of death.
Who is this...woman?!
Sa... kura...?
It's no good.
We have no choice but to flee here.
Unless we do, the only thingwaiting for us is...
Death!
Let me out! Hey!
Spit... me...out!
Darn!It's not going to work.
Something else...
Oh!
The rice ball I took for lunch!
Huh?!
It's dissolving!
I'll be digested just likethat rice ball eventually...
N-No!
Let me out! Let me...out!
Can't move already...?
She's going to kill me!
Move...move...move...!
Move!
Move! Move!
Move!
Even if it's just a little...Move!
What do you intend to do...with that?
I can't move!
Don't worry.I'll end this in a second.
You won't even havethe time to feel pain.
I wanted you to entertain me more.
It's too bad.
Am... I going to die here?
Iruka Sensei
Old Man Hokage...
Konohamaru...
Kakashi Sensei.
Sakura.
Sasuke.
A lot happened between him and me.
Even though we always squabbled,
we cooperated and saved Kakashi Senseiin that encounter with Zabuza.
During our Chakra training in forest,
we competed each other andpracticed climbing up trees.
That's it! I haven't...
settled things with him yet!
- More rice!- More rice!
If this creature doesn't want tospit me out...
I'll make it to do so at any cost!
I see.
Sasuke!
He wounded himselfat the last moment...
Move. Move. Move.Move...!
Move!
He wiped out the fear with pain.
As expected,he's not the average prey.
Shadow Clone Jutsu!
I...am a Shinobi whowill become Hokage!
I won't put up with beingsnake dung in this place!
Sasuke.
Are you okay?
If we don't flee in a hurry,we'll be discovered here, too.
How do we flee...?
How should we escape...?
I've never seen Sasuke...
so worked up.
Sasuke, a snake!
Shoot! I was too shaken upto notice the snake!
Don't come near me!
Don't lower your guard,not even for a moment...
A prey must always stay tenseand try to flee desperately...
before a predator.
Ahh... Huh?!
Sorry Sasuke..
Naruto!
The password... I forgot it!
Hey, can you hear it?
The clear, blue sky goes on and on
The ocean spans limitlessly
Please keep that smile on your face forever
Or else I'll cry
You won't have to search around you
It's all ok now.
Everyone is insidethis hand
when you want to cry, and you want to run away
When you forget what happiness is
Just sing.
Light is born, and darkness was born
The two are one
Harmonia, feel the telepathy
Hey, can you hear it?
Hey, hey, hey!
It looks like you bulliedweaklings while I was gone.
That explosion andthat huge snake,
it's all your fault, isn't it?
You darn snake bastard!
Now that l, Naruto Uzumaki, is here,I'll wipe the floor with you!
Next episode: "Naruto's Counterattack:ever Give In!"
Look forward to my kicking butt!Press down hard on the gas
That's right, there's no compromise
We'll slip through the night
At the final moment push hard
That's right, all the way to zero,
Until we wipe away the days
Gently open your heart
If you pull it close to you
It will reach you, without a doubt
It will come, closer

I like your determination!
Then...
For those who are still here...
The first test...
you have passed it!
You've passed through the gates!
The first test for the Chunin Examshas been completed...
I wish you well.
All right! Wish us well!
What a funny guy...
Huh...
I didn't think that there would bea guy who would pass the first test
with a blank test sheet.
Naruto Uzumaki.He really is a funny guy.
The Chunin Exam Stage 2:The Forest of Death!
There's something kindof creepy about this place.
This place is called the Forest of Death,you'll soon realize why.
"The Forest of Death,you'll soon realize why."
That kind of threat won't workon me one bit!
I'm not scared!
Really?
You've got a lot of energy.
A kid like you dies at very beginning,
dappled with the red blood I like.
I'm returning your... Kunai Knife...
Thank you for taking the trouble...
But... don't stand behind me,thirsty for blood.
If you don't want a quick death...
Well, it's my nature to act upat the sight of red blood.
And my precious hair was cut,so I got excited...
Naruto...
I'm sorry...
W-What with that Proctor?
Frankly, she's psycho!
This one, too...
That girl, why was her tongue so long?
Evidently, we've gota lot of hot-blooded kids this time.
This will be fun.
You're the most hot-blooded! Believe it!
Well, before we start the second exam,I have to pass this out to you!
It's a consent form,
before you can take partin the test you have to sign this.
Why?
From here on out,corpses are going to come out,
I have to get your consent to that!
Or it'll be my responsibility.
Well, I'm going to startthe explanation for the second exam.
In a word, the limits ofyour survival will be challenged.
Survival, huh?This test is a total pain.
First, I'll give you step-by-step instructionon the terrain of this Training Field.
Training Field Number 44 is surroundedby 44 locked entrance gates,
there are rivers and a forestand a tower in the middle.
It's about 10 kilometersfrom the towers to the gate...
In this confined area, you willgo through a certain survival program.
The contents of which are...
anything goes scroll battle!
Scroll...?
Yes...
I want you to fight for two scrolls,the Heaven Scroll and the Earth Scroll.
All together 26 teams gotthrough the first test.
Half of them...
1 3 teams get the Heaven scroll,the other half get the Earth Scroll.
I'll hand over one scroll to each team.
To put it simply,that's what you're vying for.
And the conditions to pass?
Three of you bring both the Heaven andEarth Scrolls to the tower in the center.
That means that of the 1 3 teams,half of them will fail for sure...
Except it has to be in time.
For this second exam,the time limit is 1 20 hours.
Do it in exactly five days!
Five days.
What do we do about food?
Be self-sufficient! It's a treasure trovein the wilderness.
There's more than enough for food...
However...
It's teeming withfierce people-eating animals,
poison bugs, poisonous weeds andmuch more.
No way...
Fool, that's why it's called survival!
Besides, it's improbable that 39 people,13 teams will pass.
The interval for activity gets longerwith passing each day,
while the time for recoverygets shorter...
Seems pretty grueling!
On top of that, you're surroundedby nothing but enemies,
even falling asleepwill be a problem...
And, besides those injuredduring attempts to capture scrolls...
there will definitely be people
are unable to endurethe rigors of the course.
Umm... so you can quit in the middle of it?
According to the rules,you cannot give up in the middle of it!
I want you to spendfive days in the forest.
Just like I thought...
This is going to be a pain!
Moving on, conditions of disqualification.
Number 1, if all three membersof the team can't make it to the tower
with the Heaven and Earth Scrollswithin the time limit.
Number 2, if a team loses a memberor if a member became incapacitated.
There's that, and this is a supplement...
Absolutely do not look atthe contents of the scrolls
until you have reached the tower!
W-What happens if we lookat it halfway through?
When you look at it you'll find... out!
Huh?
There are times when a Chuninmust deal with super-secret text.
This is to test your reliability.
That's all the explanation!
I'll exchange your three consent forms forthe scrolls in that hut over there.
After that, pick your entrance,and all the gates will open simultaneously!
Finally, just a word of advice...
Don't die!
I see, so you won't know whichscroll was given to each team...
and you won't know which ofthe three people is carrying the scroll.
If what Ibiki said was right,
there will be life or deathstruggles for information in this test.
Everyone is an enemy!
The resolve of everyone here is strong.
That means that it might cometo killing each other.
It looks like they understand the meaningof the consent form a little bit...
Heeey, look who's here!
It's Billboard Brow, isn't it?
I thought you went home long ago,I never imagined you were still here.
Ooooh? Look who's here,the ugly Inopig.
Starting now, it's five days ofthe survival test with Sasuke.
There's no reason to go home.
- Ugly!- Billboard!
- Ugly! Ugly!- Billboard! Billboard!
- Ugly, ugly, ugly!- Billboard, billboard, billboard!
- Billboard, billboard, billboard!- Ugly ugly ugly!
- Ugly, ugly, ugly, ugly!- Billboard, billboard, billboard, billboard!
Sakura, this is impossible for you.
For your own sake,just hurry up and go home!
I could say the exact same thing to you!
Hey, why are those twoon such bad terms?
D-Do you think I care aboutsomething stupid like that?
Man... all there is to dois write my name,
why does it take this much time!
Hey! Hinata! What are youdoing over there?
N-Naruto...
Umm... uhhhh...well...
Just like I thought,this kid is strange.
A scratch...
Uh-um... this... is--
See ya!
Naruto...
It's about time forthe scroll exchange.
Well, I wonder howmany teams will survive...
Teams who havetaken the scroll,
stay with the representativeand move to the gate!
We'll all start simultaneouslyin 30 minutes!!
Yeah! Survival is our forte!
Hinata, don't show your weakness.
Uh, okay...
Life or death...
It's a pain but we just have to do this.
Since it's come to this,aruto will be our target.
For snacks, there's potato chips...
- What about shortcake...?- I can't believe you two!
Okaaaay! I won't lose!
I'll bring down whoever comes near me.
- Yes!- Cha!
Heh heh...finally the opportunity is here...
We have the chance to fulfillour mission in earnest...
Sure, the enemy teams are scary but,
I'm really scared of spendingfive days with this guy.
Target the rookies first.
They said that from now onit's okay to kill,
which makes it easier.
Master Guy, I'll do my best!I'll definitely succeed!
We now start the secondtest of the Chunin Exam!
Look for the brats!
Those three, right?
All right! Let's go!
Okay! First, we search for that thing.
Can you do it, Hinata?
Yes.
Byakugan!
Slow down, Lee!We just started.
I know. But...
I can't stay still!
Who knows what kind ofpowerful foe is waiting for us.
Hot-blooded fool...
As you already understand,we have only one target!
W-What are you doing, Choji?
Just a little break...I'm already tired, and hungry...
What are you suddenly saying?!
It hasn't been five minutessince we started!
But I can't help it. I'm hungry...
You! If you were able to bring snacks,
you should have been ableto bring one Kunai knife!
Ino! Hide!
Uh-oh!
This kind of thing continuingfor five days...?
Anyway, the tower is thegoal for everyone, right?
So it would be clever for us to makea trap in the vicinity of the tower.
Okay...wasting no time, huh?
Where are they?
Heh...kids.
It's like begging to be found,standing in that conspicuous place.
They sensed our presence,
but, evidently they haven'tgrasped where we are.
What happened?You're pale.
W-What is that?!
The Flying Leeches of Leaf Villagesense body temperature and perspiration,
then in mass, swoop downon their prey.
If they continue to suckyour blood for five minutes,
you go to the other world...
Using this behavior,
we'd set a trap on the pathenemies would use to escape.
D-Darn it...
That's one team gone!
It sounds like they've already started.
Wasn't that someone screamingjust now?
I-I 'm kinda getting nervous.
I-It was nothing. Sakura.Believe it!
I-I have to pee...
Y-You...fool!
What are you doingin front of a lady!
Go to the grass!
Aaah, that was a lot!I'm refreshed.
Like I said, not in front of a lady--!
S-Sasuke... no matter what,you don't have to go that far.
W-What was that for...?
What are you doing... all of a sudden?!
What you ask? That's my line, isn't it?
Sasuke!
It can't be helped!
Sasuke, please stop!
Look closely at him!
Talk! Where's the real Naruto!
I have no idea whatyou're talking about!
What happened to the scratchon you face?
I'm asking what happened to the scratchyou got before from the Proctor!
And your Shuriken holsteris on your left leg.
That guy's right handed!
You're worse at transformationthan Naruto, you phony!
Unlucky! You got me.In that case...
Which one of you got the scroll?
If you listen to me obediently,I'll spare your lives.
I see! Then I'll resort to force!
Hey, can you hear it?
The clear, blue sky goes on and on
The ocean spans limitlessly
Please keep that smile on your face forever
Or else I'll cry
You won't have to search around you
It's all ok now.
Everyone is insidethis hand
when you want to cry, and you want to run away
When you forget what happiness is
Just sing.
Light is born, and darkness was born
The two are one
Harmonia, feel the telepathy
Hey, can you hear it?
Aww, stupid gas mask man!
Suddenly sneaking up on someonewhen they're peeing!
I messed up just a little bit.
Now I have to hurry andmeet up with Sakura.
Wait a minute!What is this giant snake?
Hey! Are you serious?!Wait a minute, hey!
I've been gulped down!

I'd like to prove thatI could become a splendid Ninja
even though I can'tuse Ninjutsu or Genjutsu!
That would be the ultimate for me!
All right!
I'm going to do my best again today!
Oh! Bushy Brow!
Oh... Good morning, Naruto.
Hey, hey, did you already get checked outby Old Lady Tsunade?
How was it, how was it?
The Leaf Village isin great trouble right now,
so we must do our best!
You're right.
Bushy Brow, you should get betteras soon as possible
and succeed in your mis--!
- Naruto!- Naruto!
What's the matter?
It's Konohamaru!
Huh? What's wrong with Konohamaru?
He's in trouble.
In trouble?!
The Will of Fire Still Burns
At this rate,we will have to open it by force.
Try it! Who do you think I am?!
I am the grandson ofthe Third Hokage!
If you go against me, then...
It means you're goingagainst the Hokage!
We need Lady Tsunadeto assume her position immediately.
Those are Pepper Smoke Bombs!
You'll get something even more terribleif you come close to me.
Honorable grandson! Even for you...
There are things that canand cannot be forgiven!
Shut up!
What is all this commotionso early in the morning?
It's hurting my head.
Lady Tsunade...
It's just one kid...What're you doing?
Yes...
Get rid of him!
But it's the grandsonof the Third Hokage!
It doesn't matter ifhe's the grandson or the great grandson.
I am the granddaughterof the First Hokage!
He might just open his eyesif he gets roughed up a little.
Now move it!
- Yes!- Yes!
Wait!
Naruto?!
Hey, hold on there.
I don't really knowwhat's going on,
but don't be so rough with Konohamaru,Old Lady Tsunade.
An acquaintance of yours?
Yes, yes...
I'll do the convincing,leave it to me.
Then, do somethingby the end of the day!
Oh, Lady Tsunade... Please wait!
Excuse me.
Oh, Sakura. Sasuke has alreadybeen discharged from the hospital.
I'm actually here to see Lee today.Is he in the rehabilitation room?
Not yet.That's not like him to be late.
I see.
The probability of a successful surgeryis 50%, at best.
And if it fails, you'll die!
Hey, Konohamaru.What are you doing in there?!
Hurry up and come out.Then let's go eat some ramen.
Don't worry. It's on me!
You can have lots of BBQ pork, too!
All right! You can have eggs too!How about that!
At least answer me!
Shut up, you fool!
You called me a fool!
Open up already! I'll break in! Hey!
Try if you can!
W-Why you--!
- Naruto...- Naruto!
Oh, Lee... You're here.
S-Sakura!
I wanted to bring you this.
F-For... me?
Th-Thank you very much!
I-I'm sorry, Sakura.
No worries.
Sasuke is now recuperating at home.
Thanks to Lady Tsunade.
At this rate,
seems like he'll be ableto get back to his duties very soon.
I see. That's very good.
Lady Tsunade is great, after all.
I think if you had her take a look,you'd get better very quickly.
Yes...
But if there is somethingthat I can do,
please feel free to tell me.
Thank you very much,Sakura.
Then I'll see you soon.
I would think that at leastone bar would be open.
There's no way.What time do you think it is right now?
I can't drink sake, and I can't gamble.
This place, the Hidden Leaf Village,is no fun at all.
Just like the Third Hokage.
Lady Tsunade!
Oh, I'm tired.
I just want to sit down andhave a drink somewhere.
I understand.
I will take you to a place whereyou can sit and have a drink.
What?
But I will have you do your work!
Here now, go ahead. It's hot.
Shizune... you've suddenlybecome very strict!
I haven't gotten strict.It's probably that you were not aware.
Not aware?!
"If I can't get in the room,then I don't have to work."
Isn't that what you were thinking?
And that's whyyou left it up to Naruto.
Humph! Could be...
This is the most recent listof Ninja.
The names and lineups ofthe groups have changed a lot.
So please look through them.And I mean, look through all of it!
Oh bother.
They have sweet rice cakes, too.
I don't like sweet things!
Hey! Konohamaru, come out already!
At least tell me why you're doing this!
Konohamaru!
Darn!
Everybody came here becausethey're worried about you!
If you don't come out,I'm going to drag you out of there!
Naruto Sacred Technique...
Sexy Jutsu!
Konohamaru, come out!
Konohamaru, hurry!
Hey! Say something at least!This is so embarrassing!
Don't fool around with me!
Shadow Clone Jutsu!
- Stop it already, Konohamaru!- Stop it already, Konohamaru!
One, two...
- Uh, what is this?- What the--?!
What's going on?!
Are you okay? Naruto?
This is the Old Man's room.
Eight D-rank missions,three C-rank missions...
I see, very much like the Kurenai team.
We can easily figure outwhat the Third Hokage was thinking.
This is the same astheir parents' team.
I see.
Oh, I see. This team has their own specialtyand is well-balanced.
My shoulders are stiff.
I'm going to go getsome fresh air outside.
Success...
Success...
Naruto...
Uh... Darn!
If that's how you're going to be,then I'm not going to go easy on you.
This is the Old Man's room!
I won't let anybodyuse this room besides him!
The Old Man's...?
That's why, as his grandson,I'm going to protect it!
Fool! This isn't the time for that!
The Leaf Village is in great danger!
So what?! It doesn't matter to me.
Are you seriously saying that?!
Oh, now I'm mad!
And I can easily tear down oneor two doors with my new powers--!
- Naruto!- Naruto!
Old Lady Tsunade...
Oh! Watch out!
W-Wow...
Listen Konohamaru.
The Hidden Leaf Village isin great trouble right now!
Our forces have dropped to almost half,and we have to finish our missions!
That's what I taught you!
Yeah... um... well...
But if we don't accomplishour missions,
that's letting other countries knowthat the village has been weakened.
That's what Iruka Sensei taught you!
Do you not like Old Lady Tsunade?
It's not that!It's not that at all.
Then what is it?
Soon, nobody will call mehonorable grandson.
Then I'll just becomeplain old Konohamaru.
So what's wrong withplain old Konohamaru?
No...
Why, why?! You hatedbeing called honorable grandson!
Everybody's going to forgetabout the Old Man.
The Old Man.
They're going to forget whata great Ninja he was,
they're just going to put him awaylike an old ashtray.
The new Hokage will make all kindsof changes in the Leaf Village.
That's not true!
The Hidden Leaf Village isthe Hidden Leaf Village.
And besides,nobody will forget about the Old Man!
No! They will never forget about him!
They will forget, I guarantee it.
They won't forget!
That's a lie!
It's not a lie!You can't believe what I am saying?!
That's right, I can't!
Oh boy!
Come with me, Konohamaru!
We just have to get Old Lady Tsunadeto promise
that she won't changethe Village Hidden in the Leaves.
And then on top of that,
we can get everybody to promise usthat they won't forget about the Old Man!
What?
Isn't that what you want?
I can't believe that I letLady Tsunade out of my sight!
Did you find her, Tonton?
Revitalizing the cells, I see.
I've found you Lady Tsunade.
What?
Lady Tsunade is studying?!
Be quiet! I can't concentrate.
Concentrate?!
I've never heard you use that wordexcept when you're gambling.
Is that Shizune's voice?
Shizune...
Do you remember that Medical Ninjaby the name of Kabuto?
What about him?
His ability to create new cells.
I was researching ways to usethat power on the patients.
For Lee?
If the 50% chance becomes 51%,it's worth a try.
It really depends on the individual's traits.
Even for you,it might be hard to acquire those powers.
I'll just have to try.
I am the Fifth Hokage, after all.
It can't be helped, Konohamaru.
I am the Third Hokage, after all.
If you don't like it,you should just quit!
Everybody from the villageis my family.
To protect the family,that is the duty of a Hokage.
Oh! Old Man!
Just for today,I'm making a special exception.
What's the matter Konohamaru?
Don't you want to seeOld Lady Tsunade?
No.
I'll just have to do it.I am the Fifth Hokage, after all.
It can't be helped, Konohamaru.I am the Third Hokage, after all.
It can't be helped.I am the honorable grandson, after all.
Huh?
I am Konohamaru ofthe Hidden Leaf Village, after all!
H-Hey Konohamaru, wait!
What's going on with him?Hey Konohamaru!
Lady Tsunade?
Nothing...
I believe your promise,its a true heart give me courage
Always I feel itthe precious time with you
On your still shoulder
I feel the wind that blowstowards tomorrow
The city lights are like pieces of stars
That hold us together
"Each one of us glows differently, "
you say laughingly
but you look most dazzling
Like a comet,
like the rainbow after the storm
You bring light into my heart
Being lost can be the answer
Let's promise we won't cheat
Uh...like a shooting star,we do go ahead.
Back then, Sensei taught me
that I would grow up to becomea great Ninja
through lots of effort andcompetition with my rivals.
His words put me at ease.
A path opened up for mejust when I was unsure of myself.
I realized that all I had to dowas try my best.
But now...
Next time: "Sensei and Student:The Bond of the Shinobi"Yeah, turn your sadness into kindness, your uniqueness into strength
Even if you get lost, let's start walking
One more time
Are you really happy
when you're always meeting to someone's expectations?
Even if you change to who you really wanna be
Will you always have a great smile?
Dreaming of only "the beginning," I wake up
and someday, I'll live on my own.
Yes, precious things are never in shape
You never know what it is when you get it or lose it
Yeah, turn your sadness into kindness, your uniqueness into strength
Even if you get lost, let's start walking
One more time

- Start the operation!- Start the operation!
Zero Hour!The Destruction ofthe Hidden Leaf Village Begins!
Lord Hokage!
Leave it to me!
Lord Kazekage!What is going on?
Lord Hokage!
Gaara!
Squad One, above.
Squad Two, below!Protect the lords!
You're in the way!
Lord Hokage...Please...flee...
It's finally our time tocome on the scene.
We've been transformedsuch a long time.
I'm totally pent up with frustration.
You guys smell all sweaty!
Come on, we're all comrades, right...?
Sound Ninja...!
Raido...
We're heading out toback up Lord Hokage.
Be careful of any traps!
Do it...
Yes sir!
- Ninja Art!- Ninja Art!
- Four Flames Formation!- Four Flames Formation!
Barrier...!
Lord Kazekage...
Barrier Ninjutsu, huh?!
To think that they could outwit Anbu...
They're not just ordinary...
What are you doing here?!Lord Hokage is in danger!
What a nuisance...
To think that the enemy wasmasquerading as our Anbu...
So it was also that guywho used Genjutsu!
Yeah...there's no mistake.
I didn't expect that...
Sand Village would betray Leaf Village.
The treaty is simply a camouflage tomake the enemy let down their guard.
The petty little battle game ends now.
From this point on, the courseof history will change!
Are you saying thatyou're starting a war?
That's right.
One should avoid resolutionthrough armed force
and should rather seeka solution through negotiations.
There's still time... Lord Kazekage!
Perhaps one gets addicted topeace as one grows older...
Sarutobi Sensei!
You're...
Just my bad luck...
to have lookout dutyon a day like this.
I wanted to watch Chunin Exam too.
Stop fussing.
The Chunin Exam takesplace twice a year.
You'll have many more chancesto see it.
But this year, that kid fromthe Uchiha Clan is taking part, right?
And I won't havea chance to see that...
I won't be able to die peacefully.
What's that?!
It's time! Begin!
The Summoning has succeeded.
Huge boa!
Notify Lord Hokage immediately!
I'm not letting you in the village!
Dispatch the reinforcements immediately!
Yes sir!
Sand Ninja!
What's going on?
Stop that, Gaara!
I'll kill him...!
There's no meaning incontinuing this fight!
Don't forget our mission!
Out of my way...!
What are you guys doing?!
The operation is already underway!
What in the world is going on?
Gaara!
What's the matter?!
His wound is deeper thanI thought!
And moreover his Chakrais pretty drained!
In that case,what about using that thing...?
That's impossible to do right away!
Idiot! It's all becauseyou didn't wait for the signal
and tried to becomethe Perfect Possession...
What should we do?!
Are you saying we have to dothis without Gaara?
Isn't Gaara here yet?!
Gaara is Sand's trump card.
We have to get Gaara to do his work,no matter what!
You guys leave for the moment andtend to Gaara's wounds!
As soon as Gaara's Chakra hasbeen restored...
the operation will recommence!
Got it!
What about you, Sensei?!
I'm gonna suppress those guys!
Do you think things willgo according to your plan?
I'll make them so...
Go!
Okay!
Is Orochimaru the host of this party?
Dunno... In any case,let's heat this thing up.
Sasuke...
Sorry, but the Chunin Exam ends here.
You've already achieved Chunin level.
If you're a Leaf Shinobi,be of service to the Leaf!
In other words, I'm supposed totake down that jerk Gaara, right?
A continuation of earlier on, right?
Don't pursue too far.
From here on, it's no longer an exam.It's the real thing!
What I have to do though...is the same!
I won't let him through!
Sasuke...!
Boy oh boy...
We intended to take Sasukewhile Gaara was causing the trouble.
But not everything goes as planned.
I see... Is that so?
So Leaf Village and...Sasuke were the target, huh?
Is the Leaf such a big catch?
More importantly,if Gaara wakes up,
I'll be able to show you somethingmuch more interesting.
Well, anyway...
Your thick-headedness has causedthe Leaf to be outmaneuvered.
It's my win.
Nothing is decideduntil the very end.
I believe that's what I taught you...
Orochimaru.
I thought this day wouldeventually arrive.
However...
You won't get my head that easily!
I told you, didn't l?
It is preferable to decidethe Fifth Hokage quickly...
Third Hokage...
because you will... die here.
I wonder how the Chunin Examsare going?
I wonder if Naruto's match is over yet?
The first match waswith Neji, right?
I want him to win thatmatch somehow or other.
That's no good!
A teacher mustn't root forone particular student!
All the graduating studentsare dear to him!
I must root for all of them equally!
But I still...want Naruto to win...
Are you worried about Naruto?
Well, of course...!
As I thought...
Y-You guys...
I told you to do ten laps aroundthe school grounds, didn't l?!
We finished that long ago.
While you were daydreaming, Sensei.
When our teacher is in that state,he can't teach a class!
So let's call it quits for today!
N-No, no!I'm continuing with class.
I wonder what that smoke is...?
That's coming from the directionof the exam arena...
Isn't there some disturbanceto the east?
I wonder if something happened?
That Orochimaru...
What should we do?
Should we send reinforcements?
No... It's dangerous to make a movewhen we don't really know
what the situation is.
If the mastermind is Orochimaru...
even more so.
Is Orochimaru...that dangerous a guy?
Originally... he was a studentof the Third Hokage.
So why did he become a Rogue Ninja?
Long ago, when the Fourth Hokagewas decided...
Orochimaru apparently asserted thathe was capable of taking on that role.
But his request was denied.
And shortly afterwards,that guy slipped out of this village.
Orochimaru most likely holdsa grudge against
the Third Hokage because of that.
Revenge... is it?
Probably.
Long ago, when I was a kid...
there's one thing I rememberthinking when I saw that guy...
That he didn't seem human...
That he seems to be somethingthat just took on a human form...
Frightening...
Simply...frightening.
Reporting!
A large boa has appeared nearthe eastern gate of the Leaf Village!
And behind it, some one hundredSand Ninja are infiltrating the country!
They are currently engaged inarmed conflict with our Shinobi
who were patrolling nearby!
The Sand...?!
Leave Squad One and Two behindand make for the eastern gate.
Immediately!
- Yes sir!- Yes sir!
We won't let you past this point!
There's quite a large number.
We were careless!
And even Lord Hokage has been...
Kakashi! Look inside the Barrier!
Yeah.
What...?
Orochimaru!
Orochimaru?!
Why is that guy...?
Don't tell me thatthey're after Sasuke again?!
Sasuke!
Huh?
He's not there...?
Sakura, stay there for a while.
I'm gonna go reducethe number of enemies.
Darn! I'm worried aboutLord Hokage, but...
Leave above to Anbu.
Besides...
Lord Hokage isn't the kind of guywho can be taken down that easily.
But...
After all, he is the Hokage ofthe Village Hidden in the Leaves.
Are you so happy, you're crying?
Or...
do you have an iota of sadnessin your heart to kill me, your teacher?
No...
Since earlier on, I was feeling so sleepy...
but I'm finally awake.
That's what I thought.
I know you aren't someonewho would hold a grudge.
You have neither a goal nor motive.
Hmm... I guess...
I do kind of have a goal.
If I were to explain it...
It's interesting to watch thingsthat move.
I get no pleasure ifsomething doesn't move.
Like a windmill that doesn't turn...
Well, it may have some kindof appeal once in a while.
But usually,it's not worth looking at it.
Right now...with a wind called"Destroy the Leaf Village,"
I want to turn that windmill.
You're the same as always...
Sakura!
It was worth teaching you Genjutsusurvival training
during the Genin Exam.
You truly have a talent for it.
Huh?
Release the Genjutsu andwake up Naruto and Shikamaru!
Naruto will be delighted.
He'll be getting a missionafter such a long while.
What do you mean by a mission?

Sakura!
It was worth teaching you Genjutsuin survival training
during the Genin Exam.
You truly have a talent for it.
Huh?
Release the Genjutsu andwake up Naruto and Shikamaru!
Naruto will be delighted.
He'll be getting a missionafter such a long while.
What do you mean by a mission?
Be careful...
It's the first A-Ranked missionsince the Land of the Waves.
Village in Distress:A New A-Ranked Mission!
Sensei! What do you mean by A-Rankedmission in the condition we are in?!
What do we have to do?!
Sasuke is chasing Gaara and companyof the Sand Village.
Sakura...
Release the Genjutsuon Naruto and Shikamaru,
and go after Sasuke.
I feel uneasy...about that unusual Chakra.
But then,
we should wake up Ino and Chojiand go in a large group.
There may alreadybe quite a large number
of Sand and Sound Shinobiwho have infiltrated this village.
Actions lose quickness when there's morethan the fundamental four in a squad...
and it becomes difficult tohide from the enemy.
You learned that in the Academy'spatrol practical training, right?
Oh, I see! Then four meansthat you'll come with us...
No, I must not leave here.
Summoning Jutsu!
As for the rest, this Pakkun willtrack down Sasuke by scent!
C-Could it be...the one other member is this puppy?!
Hey! Little girl!Don't you be calling me a cute puppy!
I didn't say...cute.
Okay, Sakura! Release the Genjutsuon Naruto and Shikamaru!
Okay!
Release!
What is it... Sakura?
Get down!
I'll tell you later!Just stay down!
Shikamaru... you were...from the beginning...
Owwee!
You were able to release Genjutsu, too!
Why were you pretendingto be asleep?!
Humph! I don't want toend up getting involved!
Heck no...I could care less about Sasuke!
Owwee!
W-What's going on...?
Naruto! Behind you!
F-Fast...
Not just fast...
Guy Sensei!
Now, I'll announce the mission!
As soon as you've heard whatthe mission is, go through that hole.
Track down Sasuke,join up and then stop him!
Then await next ordersin a safe place.
Huh? Did something happento Sasuke?!
I'll tell you the reason en route!
Let's go!
Jeez... Why me?
Hey, boy!
Huh...?
If this mission is a success,
as a reward I'll let youtouch my paw-pads.
So don't sulk like that!
Huh?
See?
They're soft and supple!
Su..pple...?
Yes, very...
Soft and Supple!
Let's just go!
H-Hey!
Will it be okay with just them?
They'll be okay.Pakkun is with them.
As long as they don't pursue too far...
To think I'd be able to fight you again...
This barrier can't be brokenunless it's from the inside.
If Lord Hokage would justtake out one of those four,
we could help...
Hey, it's gonna start soon.
Put up a barrier on the inside, too!
Sure!
Hm... It doesn't look likeI'll be able to get out this easily.
You don't really mean that.
It'd be tougher for you if someonecame in and got in the way, right?
Ninja Art: Tile Shuriken!
That's too easy!
Striking Shadow Snake!
With such a weak technique...
It sucks to get old, eh,Sarutobi Sensei?
Substitution?!
Earth Style: Great Mud River!
Is this it?
I don't think so!
Earth Style: Earth Dragon Bomb!
Fire Dragon Bomb!
He's combined Earth and Fire!
Excellent, Lord Hokage!
Stop the stupid act, Orochimaru.
Very good...
Really, I've been grossly underestimated.
Did you think you could kill mewith that level of Jutsu?
Humph... A hateful fellow as usual!
Don't say that.
A high maintenance student is cute.Right, Sarutobi Sensei?
Something's strange...
All of the Academy's classesdoing self-study.
And that smoke...
That's coming from the directionof the exam arena.
Isn't there some disturbanceto the east?
I wonder if something happened...
This is definitely strange!
But sudden self-study issure a smack in the eye!
It's been like this for a while!
Yeah. Iruka Senseiand everyone are late...
Aren't they, Konohamaru?
Konohamaru?
Yikes!
Jeez, what is this?!
And Mom just bought this for me!
I'll loan you my colored pencil.
What're you saying?!This color is this spring's new color!
Aww, what'll I do?
That is...?
I wonder if Naruto and the otherswent to stop Sasuke?
Those brats?
But surely, some Genin won'tbe able to make any difference...
Hm? Is this the data ofthat kid back there?
You give him too much credit.
Think again!
You'll trip up if you underestimate him.
Teachers' Office
There is information that several unitshave already infiltrated the village...!
We should evacuate the studentsto a safe place right away!
Yes... And without causing panicamong the students!
Then let's evacuate the students
as soon as possible underthe pretense of an evacuation drill!
Isn't it about timewe stopped playing around?
This isn't an Academy class, so...
You have a point.
Did you foresee your final moments?
I won't go easy on youjust because you're doddering.
I look forward to it.
Depending on your Jutsu,
I might have to have youstart over at the Academy!
Please don't disappoint me too much!
W-Wow...
What Chakra?!
Yeah... It seems the air isbearing down within the body!
Shuriken Shadow Clone Jutsu!
Summoning Jutsu: Reanimation!
That technique!
One!
He is using a Summoning Jutsuas a shield.
And this dead person is...
Two!
I must stop the third one at any cost...!
Three!
It looks like the third one was no good.Oh well...
It looks like I stopped the third one.
Now, this is where it gets tough...
He summoned those two of all people...
I-It can't be!Those personages are...!
Those personages are?
Now, what will you do,Sarutobi Sensei...?
No...
Lord... Third Hokage.
Okay! Everyone, please move quickly!
Oh, what a day!
My favorite colored pencildidn't have to break like that!
Lousy evacuation drill...Self-study was better.
Konohamaru's been quiet, hasn't he?I wonder what's wrong?
Huh? Yeah.
After the whole school doesa long self-study,
the whole school doesan evacuation drill.
This is too strange!
Okay! Stop! Get in line!
That look on Iruka Sensei's face...
Something's definitely going on here!
And also...
Okay, everyone!Don't go off on your own.
That rainbow... It's beenbugging me for a while!
What's that, Old Man?There's a strange rainbow!
It's an unusual rainbow!
Do you like rainbows, Konohamaru?
Yeah! And I've never seensuch a pretty rainbow!
I see, I see.But, Konohamaru...
Hmm?
Rainbows used to symbolize snakes...
And it's said that they bode evil.
Such a pretty thing? That's a lie!
I see, I see.
Symbolizes snakes...Is something happening?
Long time no see... Saru.
Oh, it's you...You've gotten old, Sarutobi.
I never thought I would meetthe great brothers in this manner...
It's regretful.
This is bad.
That Summoning Jutsu...
Who in the world are they?!
Please prepare yourselves...
Lord First Hokage...
Lord Second Hokage!
That's right...
The one with the black hairis the First Hokage.
The one with the white hairis the Second Hokage.
They are both reputed tobe the highest Shinobi
and they are the Hokageswho built the today's Leaf Village!
Reanimation, huh?
This youth summoned us withthe Forbidden Jutsu, then?
He's something else...
Then, Sarutobi!
Does this mean we must...fight you?
Let's stop the old peopleget-together talk...
Shall we get started?
There's always fighting...no matter when you live.
You like that, don't you?
No good will come by deriding the deadand playing around with time!
I get it! So that's what happened!
That Sasuke, getting all impatient!
So, why am I pulled into this?!This is such a drag!
It can't be helped!It's Kakashi Sensei's order.
This way!
That brat, huh...
Let's go!
Everyone makes mistakesIt's nothing to be ashamed about
Don't let this scar be for naughtWalk with a smile
Yes, breathe in the airLift your face to the sky and jump
If it rains, take a breakGo where the wind takes you
So many regretsDon't let this scar be for naught
Let's go carve the badges in our chestYes, it's Show Time, life begins now.
Everyone makes mistakesIt's nothing to be ashamed about
Don't let this scar be for naughtWalk with a smile
Transform sadness into the windand continue to forge on
Forge on strong
Darn it! The pursuer is too fast!
Once we Genin get caught,that will be the end.
In that case,we should ambush and attack them.
I already thought of it,but it'll probably be no use.
Then, what should we do?!
There is only one choice.
Next time, "A Shirker's Call to Action:Layabout No More!"
It isn't my style,but we have no choice, I guess.
C'mon!
Running like a fugitive,
Being chased by something
Inside my heart is pounding
My throat dry like it's withering
For no single one,
To none does belong,
This time is ours, right now...
Unraveling the pain,
Unraveling our hearts,
Unraveling shadows
Stifling our breath,
Reaching for beyond,
Tearing through the dark
In fighting and in love
To the distant light above,
Yes, we are on the way
I wanna rock...
Rockin' my heart
The Demon in the Snow
Gato, why did you come here?
And who are those henchmen?
Our strategy has changeda little...
I'm sorry about this Zabuza,
but you will die here.
What?!
Since hiring a regular Shinobicosts a lot of money,
I hired Rouge Ninjas like you.
And, it would have been evenmore ideal
to save my money and effort ifinja-to-Ninja battles
ended in each killing the other off.
Well, you are certainly not worthyof being called
the Demon of theHidden Mist Village.
If you were to ask me,you're just a cute little demon!
What are those guys?
So many of them...
Kakashi... I apologize.
Our fight ends here...
As long as my reason totake down Tazuna is gone,
there is no reason to fight you either.
Yeah...you are right.
That reminds me...
I owe him something.
He squeezed my arm 'til it broke...
Huh, he's dead.
You bastard!
What do you think you're doing, hey?!
Stop! Don't act so recklessly...!
You say something, too!He was your comrade, right?
Shut up, punk.Haku is already dead.
What...?
Don't you feel anything watchinghim doing that!
Weren't you with Haku for a long time!
As Gato used me...I was simply using Haku.
I thought I'd told you...
We Shinobi are merely tools.
What I wanted were his skillsand not Haku himself.
I have no regrets...
Do you...Do you really mean that?
Naruto, stop.
There's no need to fighthim anymore... Besides...
Shut up!My enemy is still...this one!
He...
He really liked you!
Is there someone special in your life?
He liked you that much!
When a person feels he wantsto protect a person special to him,
that person can truly become strong.
Even so,don't you feel anything at all?!
It's difficult for me to completelybecome a Shinobi.
You really...honestly...
don't feel anything at all?
I'd like to make that person'sdream come true...
For that, I could completelybecome a Shinobi.
When a person becomesas strong as you...
Does that person reallybehave like you?
He threw his life awayfor you!
I'd like to make thatperson's dream come true...
That is my dream.
He didn't even fulfill hisown dreams and yet...
I was happy.
To die as a tool...!
That's...That's...too painful...
Kid...
Don't say anything...anymore.
Haku was...
He wasn't just thinking of me.
He was feeling pain insidefor you
while he battled you guys too...
I know.He was too kind...
I'm glad we could fight with youat the end.
Huh?
Yes, little punk,it's as you say, after all...
Shinobi are human too...
Maybe it's impossible to becomean emotionless tool...
I've lost.
Kid! Give me the Kunai knife!
Okay...
What?!
Enough! Take them down!
Right!
Are you crazy?
Do you think you can win by yourselfagainst this many of us?
D-Demon!
If you're so anxiousto join your friend...
you go ahead...alone!
Unfortunately...
I don't...intend on going...to the same place...as Haku!
W-What?! Pretending to be so tough...
You're going to hell with me!
It's no big deal...
When the Demon ofthe Hidden Mists Village
dies and goes to hell,he can become a real demon.
Look forward to it!
I'll let you find outfor sure
if I'm a cute little demon or not in hell!
Haku...
Now...it's goodbye, Haku...
Thanks for everything...
I'm sorry...
Don't look away.
It's the end fora man who lived fiercely.
Yup...
Did l...die...?
Sasuke!
Sakura...
Am l...am l...?!
Sakura, you're heavy.
Huh?!
Sasuke...
Sasuke, Sasuke, Sasuke...!
Sakura...That hurts...
Things turned out well,didn't they, Sakura?
Stop, you shouldn't move...!
Anyway, where's Naruto?
And also,what happened to that mask guy?
Naruto's fine.
And...the masked kid,he died...
Died? Did Naruto get him?
Well... I'm not really sure,but he protected Zabuza...
I had faith in you.
You are awesome, Sasuke!
You avoided getting inflicted withany mortal wounds!
From the beginning...he intended to...
Naruto!
Sakura...
Sasuke's all right!He's alive!
Huh?
He was feeling pain insidefor you while he battled you guys too...
He was too kind...
I see... He...
So, Sasuke's all right too...
That's a relief...
Hey, hey, hey!
You guys are too relaxed!
Darn Ninja...!Killing our source of money!
Now that it's come to this,
there's no choice but to attackthe whole town and
take everything valuable!
Shoot, this isn't good!
Kakashi Sensei!
Don't you have a Jutsuto annihilate them all at once?
That's impossible!I've used too much Chakra!
Here we go!
Enemies who come any closerto the island...
With all the might ofall the island's people...
will not be allowed to live!
Yeah!
Inari!
Heroes always arriveon the scene late!
Inari... You guys...
Okay, I'm gonna help out, too!
Shadow Clone Jutsu!
I can do that evenwith my scarce Chakra...
At least, it will bluff...
Shadow Clone Jutsu!
Kakashi Version!
So...are you ready to fight?!
No, we're not!
We've done it!
Sounds like it's over.
Yeah...
Kakashi...I need to ask you a favor.
What is it?
His...I want to see his face...
All right.
Huh?
Snow...
Snow at this timeof the year...?
Haku...Are you crying?
Thanks, Kakashi...
You were always at my side...
At the very least...
I can be at your side in the end.
If it's possible...
I'd like to go...
to the same place...
as you.
This guy...
He was born in a villagewhere it snowed a lot.
I see...
He was a boy as pure as snow...
You'd be able to go, Zabuza.
The two of you...together.
But you know, Kakashi Sensei...
Hmm?
I wonder if the way a Ninjashould be
is really as thesetwo were saying.
Shinobi should not seekthe reason for their own existence.
What's important is toexist merely as tools.
That's the same in the Land of Leaves.
I wonder if that's whatit really means
to become a real Ninja.
I guess... I guess...!
I don't like that!
Do you think so, too?
Hmm...
Well... That's why all Ninja live
trying to figure thatout without realizing...
Like Zabuza...and that kid...
Okay!
Huh?
I've just decided!
I'm going to pursue myown Way of Ninja!
I'm gonna sprint straightahead and pursue
a way that I absolutelywon't regret!
Thanks to you the bridgewas safely completed,
but we will miss you very much.
Take care.
Thank you for everything.
Now, now!
We'll come back fora visit again, Tazuna!
For sure...?
Huh?
Inari...you're gonnamiss us, aren't you?
It's all right to cry.Go ahead and cry!
I won't cry!
It's all right if you cry,aruto!
Oh, is that so?
See ya!
Oh....!
You are so stubborn.
That boy changed lnari's mind...
and lnari changed the mindsof the village people.
That boy created a bridgelinking us to hope,
a bridge called courage.
So a linking bridge...
Speaking of bridges,
we need to namethis bridge, don't we?
That's true.
In that case,
I have a perfect namefor this bridge.
Yeah, what is it?
The Naruto Great Bridge?How's that?
That's a good name.
Okay! I'll get back soonand have lruka Sensei treat me
to ramen asthe mission completion celebration!
And! And! I'll tell Konohamarutales of my heroic exploits!
Then l...
Hey! Sasuke, do you want to goon a date
when we get back to the village?
No, I don't think so.
Just like that...?!
You know! You know!I'll go with you!
Be quiet!
Shut up! Naruto!
What? Are you surethat name's okay?
This name is to wish thatthis bridge will never collapse...
And someday, it'll be the nameof a very famous bridge...
A name heard around the world.
That's truly what I hope.
Hey, hey!
Our Group Seven alwayshas the easy missions lately.
Meanwhile, there are plenty ofpowerful Ninja
Iike Zabuza and Haku in other lands.
Aren't there more exciting missionswhere I can be more active?
Where I can use my Way ofthe Ninja and my soul like... you know?
Next time:"A New Chapter Begins:The Chunin Exam!"
This is my Way of Ninja!Press down hard on the gas
That's right, there's no compromise
We'll slip through the night
At the final moment push hard
That's right, all the way to zero,
Until we wipe away the days
Gently open your heart
If you pull it close to you
It will reach you, without a doubt
It will come, closer
Now
We're speeding through life,squeezing it for all of its worth
Our feet are tied
But we still keep going farther
Even if I take it back, and grasp it
If you're not the one
There will be no meaning
And so we'll go far off into the distance.

Akamaru Trembles:Gaara 's Cruel Strength!
That guy...?
Everyone hide!
No, lie low quick!
W-Where is that guy?
Naruto...
That fool, he finally woke up.
You are quite one of a kind.
Actually, you are getting on my nerves.
Sakura!
- What?- Y-Y-Your...!
Sakura...your hair!
Oh! This...?
I'm changing my image,changing my image!
I like it better long but,
when I move around ina forest like this,
it gets in the way if it's long.
By the way...
why are you guys here?!
Hah... It's such a painto explain it to you.
Everybody helped out.
Huh?
Sakura's putting on a show of bravado...
I'll take care of him from here.
Ah... Okay...
Keep it together! Lee!
Oh? Tenten, why are you here?
I came to help.
Huh...?
Those guys,where's the Sound Village Ninjas?
A kid named Sasukedrove them away!
Really...
Why did you hastily decidedto act on your own?!
Besides, you really got beaten up!
S-Sakura was in danger.So as a man, l...
You're kidding...!
If it were Lee alone,he wouldn't have lost to those guys.
You're really stupid.
I can't argue with that.
You, Bushy-Brow!
Naruto!
Don't say rude things to Lee!
What in the world...
happened while I was asleep?
That Naruto,he's completely out of the loop.
He's not the type to bethe protagonist of a story, certainly not.
Lee...
Thank you.
Because of you,I was able to wake up.
I feel like I've gotten a little stronger!
Sakura...
It looks like my effortsweren't enough!
Sasuke... Just what you'd expectfrom the Uchiha clan.
To chase off the Sound Village Ninjas,
just as I thought,you possess amazing strength.
I was beaten to a pulp.
What?! He was beaten to a pulp?!
What's he talking about?
Were those guys really that strong?
Sakura!
The Lotus of Leaf Villageblooms twice.
Huh?
When we meet again,I will have become a stronger man.
I pledge it.
Okay.
Hey Sakura!
Come here, come here!
Your hair! I'll fix it for you!
That'd be great.
You are really sneaky.
Hugging him like that,you little billboard brow.
It's called first come-first served,Miss Ino-pig.
Sasuke... Uchiha.
At any rate...he's a strong opponent.
Are you okay, Akamaru?
Is he still shaking?
It's already been half a day.
Akamaru...
I don't blame him,it's because he saw that thing...
After all, brains are most importantin survival!
Right. Akamaru?
Lucky for us,
the guys who got caught inthe trap had an earth scroll!
We'll be the first tothe tower at this rate!
Don't get carried away.That's dangerous.
No matter how small a bug it is,it has to guard itself at all times.
We have to pay attention to avoidcoming across any enemies...
This is safety.
I know that!
As always, you're speaking in a waythat's difficult to understand, bug-nerd.
Um... B-But...What Shino said...
He has a point.
I know! C'mon.
Naruto...
I hope nothing's happened to him...
Hey you two, stop.
We're being careful not tocome across enemy, right?
Then Hinata!
Can you see 1 kilometerin that direction?
Yep... I'll have a look.Byakugan!
T-There's someone there.
Evidently there are...6 people...
Okay! Let's go look!
Huh?
Kiba! What are you saying?We're not doing that.
The Proctor told us to bring
one of each "Heaven" and "Earth"scroll in a pair.
He didn't say not totake more than that.
If we take more, that meanssome other teams will be left out.
B-But...
We'll just see what's going on at first..
If it looks too dangerous,we won't battle for no reason.
- Let's go!- Oh!
He's an irritating type, that one.
What's up, Akamaru?
What happened? You stopped suddenly.
Akamaru suddenly got frightened.
W-Why is that?
Akamaru can sniff out the level of enemy'sChakra and tell his strength.
But this is the first time I’veseen him this scared.
The people going at it up aheadaren't ordinary guys...
Sand Village kids comingto challenge us forthright.
It's foolish.
What's that little guy thinkingto get involved with those guys...?!
W-What is Akamaru saying...?
He's saying that big guy is dangerous.
T-They certainly look like bad news...
They seem really strong.
Hey, kids, you shouldpick your opponents...
You're all going to die.
That's enough of you.
Let's do this quickly...old chap from Hidden Rain Village.
Which scroll do those guys have...
Hey Gaara!
Doesn't it make sense tofollow them
and gather informationbefore hunting them?
If they have the same type of scrollthere's no need to fight.
Unnecessary battles are....
It doesn't matter.
If their eyes meet with mine...I'll kill them all.
That's why I don't wantto be with this guy.
Well, let's do it. Quickly!
Die, kid!
Ninja Art: Senbon Rainstorm!
Hidden Senbons!
Up down right left,there is no dead spot in this Jutsu.
In addition, all the Senbons arecontrolled by my Chakra
and attack on the intended prey!
Too easy.
Is that all?
I-It can't be...?!
Not even one...?
No wounds...? Ridiculous!
Senbon Rainstorm, huh...?
Well, I'll make it rain blood.
What a giant Chakra.
And, that sand...
It smells terrible.
Smell?
A strong smell of blood...
Wall of sand...?
That's right.An absolute defense by sand!
He manipulates sand insidea gourd and
hardens it with magnified Chakra.
It defends the circumferenceof Gaara's body.
It's a Jutsu that onlyhe can get away with...
Furthermore, it's somehow alwaysautomatically done
without Gaara's intentions.
Which means that all attacksin front of Gaara fade into nothing.
That little...
You guys can't defeat our Gaara.
Don't underestimate me!
This guy's a goner...
That's what you get for rebellingagainst Gaara...
Sand Coffin!
I can't move...
T-This won't...!
I can cover your loud mouthand kill you.
But that's too pathetic.
Sand Burial!
There's no pain.
I knocked him even harderthan was necessary.
The bloody tears of a corpse mergewith vast sinking sand
and provide more powerto the demon of war.
T-The scroll.
We'll give it to you!
Please! Let us go!
No-o-o-!
T-This is bad.
Let's escape quickly!If he finds us he'll kill us!
Luckily it is a Heaven scroll.
Okay! Let's go to the tower.
Shut up.
It's still... not enough for me!
U-Uh-oh! Did he notice us?!
Let's quit...Gaara.
Are you scared, coward?
Gaara! It's certainly no problem for you,but it's too dangerous for us!
One set of scrolls is good.
More than this is...
Lame people don't give directions to me.
That's enough!
How about if you sometimes listento what your big brother has to say?!
I've never thought of you as my siblings.
If you get in my way... I'll kill you.
G-Gaara cut it out! Please.
Don't say something so cold.
As a favor to your sister...Okay?!
Gaara!
Fine.
That's why I hate brats.
What? So that's it Akamaru?
C'mon, you should havesaid something sooner.
Nobody's here...?
Heh heh! We're the first?!
No, I sensed someone a little while ago.
More importantly, is Akamaru okay?
He's been scared ever since then.
Now that you mention it,what did Akamaru say before?
Oh... Akamaru said that itwas dangerous
because that sand squirtwould kill that big guy.
Sheesh! Just like I thought,there's no other place to go!
They've already made uswait for half a day!
How much longer do we have to wait?
Anyway. That Sand Village squirt...
I don't know what he is but,that guy...
He's too dangerous.
It's becoming a real disaster,but we can't cancel this test.
What do you mean?
Excuse me!
What is it?!We're talking about something important!
Excuse me.
But... Uh...
Please take a look at this!
The video...?
Ready? Here! Look at the time!
T-This is...
It's a recording inside the tower,
one hour and thirty-seven minutesafter the start of the second test!
Three Ninja from Hidden Sand Villagebroke through the second test.
This can't be...!
In a mere ninety-seven minutes...
This has never happened!
This is an anomaly.
Those guys are not Genin level.
They've rewritten thefastest time by four hours...
It's not just that.
What do you mean?
It's 10 kilometersfrom the test entrances to the tower.
Ferocious animals, poisonous insects,the rugged forest road...
As if those were not there...
Especially the brown-haired kidright in front...
What about him?
You don't notice?
I see. This is quite a surprise.
What about him is so...?
Look closely at his body.
I see.
He doesn't have a single scratch.
What's worse, there's nota smudge of dirt on his clothing.
Even I...
No, any of the other Chunin...
It's impossible for us tomake it to this tower without a scratch.
It's likely that it has somethingto do with his ability.
After a long time, a dependableguy has appeared.
Even though he's got evil eyes.
Hey, can you hear it?
The clear, blue sky goes on and on
The ocean spans limitlessly
Please keep that smile on your face forever
Or else I'll cry
You won't have to search around you
It's all ok now.
Everyone is insidethis hand
when you want to cry, and you want to run away
When you forget what happiness is
Just sing.
Light is born, and darkness was born
The two are one
Harmonia, feel the telepathy
Hey, can you hear it?
- Please!- No!
- Just a little bit.- No!
- Really only a little bit.- No means no!
I'll just look a little and put it back.
Remember what theProctors said, loser.
When they say don't look, don't look,
it just makes me wantto look all the more!
If you can look when you can,let's look!
Naruto lost it!
Sakura! Get a hold of Naruto!

Well then, Guy.I'll leave Sasuke to you.
Master Jiraiya...
Hmm?
Be sure to find Mistress Tsunadeand bring her back to...
You bet we'll find herand bring her right away!
Naruto! I like kids with guts like you!I'm going to give this to you!
This made Lee stronger...
Huh?! What?! What?!
This is it!
Wow!
They're breathable andmoisture-wicking,
and perfectly designed for free movement,all in a beautiful, stylish package.
You'll notice a difference immediatelyif you train with them on!
They're going to grow on you!
Before long, you'll be wanting towear them all the time like Lee!
Of course, I have a thing for them, too!
Woooow!
Why couldn't you bring a mirroror something
instead of carrying aroundthose things, you dork!
Do you think they'll look good on me?
Don't even think about it.Get a load of that...
Now that is truly dorky.
Okay! This is the place!
Here?!
The gambling house frequentedby the entire town...
Your target is Naruto, after all.
To abduct Naruto is the No. 1 priorityplaced by our organization, Akatsuki!
What's wrong?
Pervy Sage... Why are they after me?
You know, don't you, Pervert Sage?T ell me why...
They're not really after you...They're after what's inside of you.
What on earth is this thing?
It's a horrible demon thatattacked Leaf Village, right?
And was dreaded by all.
So why do they want it so much?
Indeed, the Nine-Tailed Foxis a demon
that appears at each critical juncturethroughout the ages
destroying everything in its path...
And people feared it likean act of nature.
The reason they want that thing...for what purpose.
Honestly, I can't quite say.
Just that now that Nine-Tailed Foxis sealed up inside of you...
they might be thinkingthey want that power in their control.
It must be harsh to know
that Ninja like themwould keep coming after you...
But well, that's your destiny!
Now don't you worry,I'm going to protect--
Then there's nothing to dobut hurry up and get stronger! I've got to!
Okay! Let's go find that Tsunade person,
have her save Sasukeand get down to some serious training!
That's just like this kid...
A New Training Begins:I Will Be Strong!
Th-This place has the highest antes...!
Don't go fretting overevery little thing!
Let's go!
Oh dear! Please wait!
Hmm?
What?
The beautiful woman youwant to "research" on...
That's this Tsunade person?
Whoa! That's sharp coming from you!And what about it?
She's part of the Sannin thinglike you, right, Pervy Sage?
Yes, and what of it?
How...old is she?
My age.
Heck, she's an old lady.
Yikes!
Huh?!
Th-This woman is...!
Would you mind changing allof this money into chips for me?
Oh no! She's really going for it!
Just who is this? This lady...
You don't know?
She's that woman withthe famous alias...
Famous alias...?
So, well...what kind of personis this Tsunade like?
Oh, you want to know?
Yeah.
Let's see...
Put simply, she's an unpleasant type.
Besides that, she's a diehard gamblerand her face is known far and wide for it.
Then we should have no problemsfinding her!
If she's that famous!
She's famous, all right...Legendary, you might say...
Boss, what's this alias...?
The Legendary...
Legendary...?
Oh dear! They're all laughing!
- Legendary...- Legendary...
Sitting Duck!
Yup! But no matter how famousLegendary Sitting Duck is,
I doubt we'll find her right away.
Why not?!
She hates growing old so much
she's probably used some special Jutsuto change her appearance.
She's actually 50 years old,
but no doubt she looks likeshe did when she was 20...
And not just that,recently I heard that...
she transforms into her teens or30s or 40s as the situation calls for
to escape moneylenders.
What?! That's a horrible thing to do!
Tsunade has always lovedto gamble more than anything
But she has terrible luck and no skill.
She was always being playedfor the Sitting Duck and the name stuck...
Then she was always borrowing moneyand skipping out on her debts, too...
Ah, it brings back memories.
This is no time to begetting all nostalgic!
Tell me, how do you proposewe go about finding her?!
Well...
We may very well have toput our noses to the ground,
but we're not without our little tricks.
What?! So you have no ideahow long it's gong to take?!
We won't be wasting any time.
All of our time on the roadwill be your time.
My time?
Time to make you strong...Training!
Okay!
No, no... I told you that is definitely out.
I won't be seen walking with someonedressed like that.
Come on, Pervy Sage!Let's hurry up and start training!
Now now, don't get ahead of yourself...
The training won't mean anything
unless it's done in the process ofgathering information on Tsunade.
Huh? Gathering information...?
In this town.
Wow!
Cool! This is my first timefor this kind of thing!
Down time is important, too!
You go have yourself some funbefore we start training.
The festival should continuefor some time.
We'll stay here in this cityfor the duration.
We'll train here, too!
All right!
Whoa! That's a fat wallet!You're rich!
I have quite a bit!
I've saved it little by littlethroughout my missions.
Well then!
- Wait! Naruto!- Huh?
I'll hold on to your wallet for you!
Wh-What do you think you're doing?!
You can spend this much...
What?! Only 300 ryo!
No complaints!
Remember Shinobi must honorthe " Shinobi's Three Taboos"!
Shinobi's Three Taboos...?What's that?
What?! You don't know!
The "three taboos" arethe three temptations
that will bring Shinobi to ruin!
The three temptations arebooze, women and money...
Oh, then this doesn't really applyto me all that much!
I'm minor, so I can't drink yet!I don't quite get the women thing!
And I worked so hardto save all that money,
I don't really feel much like using it...
You fool! Don't you underestimatethe desire for money!
Once you start using it,it goes really fast!
Money has a frightful power.
This Tsunade we are goingto be looking for
has ruined herself over it!
Your desire for women is alwaysgetting the better of you, too, Pervy Sage!
I'm going onan information-gathering mission!
Here, you hold on to my bag for me!
If you get lost,
my tracking Summons Toadwill follow my scent!
He's really just a child after all,contrary to appearances...
Okay! First, I'll get a little something to eat!
I'll take one order ofoctopus dumplings, sir!
Right!
- Potatoes with butter please!- You got it!
- I want chocolate bananas.- Right!
- I want apricot candy!- Thank you!
- I want okonomiyaki too!- Here you go! Watch out, it's hot!
One extra-large orderof fried noodle, sir!
Right... But my you've gota lot of food there, young man!
You don't planto eat it all yourself now, do you?!
Eh? As a matter of fact,I am gong to eat it all myself.
Oh, um, here you go...
I think I ate a bit too much.
I wonder how everyone is?
Kakashi Sensei... Sasuke... Sakura...
I'm going to train hard every dayand come back stronger.
Just you wait and see!
But before that...I better work off that meal!
Last one!
- All right! Perfect!- Oh! Amazing!
That's the fruit of hard trainingthrowing shuriken.
You stink, sonny!
Hah! Gosh darn it!Well, just watch this!
Hold it!
Huh?
Attention: Shinobi!injutsu strictly forbidden!
Thanks now!
You shouldn't try to walk aroundwith the mask on.
It's Pervy Sage's bank saving book.
One, ten, one hundred...
L-Look at all those zeros!
He should be treating me now and thenif he has this much money.
Stingy old geezer!
There's only a little left....One more stand and that will be it...
Time to make you strong...Training!
Two grilled squids please, sir!Make one of those an adult size!
Okay! Someone sent youto buy some squid, eh?!
I'll throw in a child size for free!Coming right up!
Hurray for you, sir!You're a man among men!
Oh, you can tell, eh?! All right!I'll give you the adult one for half price!
Thanks!
Good grief, where did he go to?!
Huh? The voice of Pervy Sage?
Young ladies are so nice.
Oh, Naruto! You've already hadyou're fill of the festival?
Repeat those three Shinobi Taboos again!
You're breaking all three at once!You bastard!
W-Wait, Naruto...
N-No, I won't wait!
You used all my hard-saved money!
- Take this and this and this!- N-Naruto, stop!
I'll pay it all back!I'm sorry, p-please!
You! You!You made my froggy wallet all flat!
Hey! Look what you did, you urchin!
You stained Leader's designer suit!You'll have to pay for it!
Fork over 1 00,000 ryo!
What?! You're telling methat suit cost 1 00,000 ryo?!
Yeah, really, that's quite a stretch
to say a dorky suit like thatcost 1 00,000 ryo.
Are you asking for it?!
You better put a lid on itif you know what's good for you.
The leader used be a Chunin fromthe Hidden Village of Stones,
the legendary dark Ninja, feared by all!
Come again? Legendary what?
You seem to want to get hurt!
Naruto.
Perfect timing.
I'll show you a Jutsu now...Watch very carefully!
Now you've done it!
A-Amazing!
I was holding back quite a bit...You guys are so weak.
A-Are you? The... legendary...
I'm sorry...We kind of destroyed your stand...
H-Here... Fix it with this.
Oh! Thanks.
Would you mind if I bought allyour balloons and water balloons
at the same time, my man?
Fine by me...
That wasn't an ordinary hand move...
What in blazes was that?!That Jutsu!
Naruto!
Come with me! It's training time!
Yes, sir!
Finally, the mood is rightfor a little training.
- Here! Water balloon!- Wha--?
Eh?! What is it for?!
You saw that Jutsu I just used, right?
Y-Yeah.
What Jutsu did it look like to you?
It looked like you madeyour opponent spin violently.
His perspective's off...But I guess that's to be expected.
Right, okay... Yes, spinning!
He's spinning the water in the balloonwithout moving his hand?!
Whoa!
The tree-climbing exercise
to learn to gather andmaintain Chakra in necessary places...
The Walk-on-Water exercise
to learn how to releasea set amount of Chakra...
You did both of these, right?
And now with this water balloon exercise,
you'll learn how to createa stream of Chakra...
In other words, spinning.
Create a stream of Chakra...
I'll give a more detailed explanationof the Jutsu
once you get these first steps down.
First, you must gatherand maintain Chakra in your hand
using the tree-climbing technique.
Then you must continuouslyrelease Chakra
using the Walk-on-Water technique.
Then you push and churn the waterin the balloon with the Chakra!
I get it!
Then you spin the waterin the balloon faster and faster
until the balloon pops!
You're catching onmore and more quickly!
Okay, today we're goingto train until evening!
Yes, sir!
A cycle of hardship, right?
Inside, we were crying, right?
But the one thing we won't give upis the dream we've chosen, right?
It's a secondary role,
a role in the shadows
But in reaching for that dream,
let us stay centered,let us stay true
Over and over,we hung on without giving up
Over and over,we kept coming back up
Over and over,we believed and dreamed
Over and over,we've seen fools
Over and over,we've stood in the shadows of others
Now, it's our turn...Let us bask in our dreams
I will break this water balloonno matter what!
Hey, you're full of spirit!
Perhaps I can expect himto master the Jutsu.
The water inside the balloonis moving.
By the way, when does that pop?
Next time: "Keep on Training:Pop Goes the Water Balloon!"
Aw geez! Why won't it pop?!Press down hard on the gas
That's right, there's no compromise
We'll slip through the night
At the final moment push hard
That's right, all the way to zero,
Until we wipe away the days
Gently open your heart
If you pull it close to you
It will reach you, without a doubt
It will come, closer
Now
We're speeding through life,squeezing it for all of its worth
Our feet are tied
But we still keep going farther
Even if I take it back, and grasp it
If you're not the one
There will be no meaning
And so we'll go far off into the distance.

Three isn't enough!
Three more, you loser!
This is very taxing, you know?!
I mean, let's switch!
Sasuke!
The fire's ready to light!Fireballs please.
I guess three is okay for the time being...
Wha--?
Hey, wait a minute!
The Scroll's Secret:o Peeking Allowed
It's already been four dayssince the second exam started.
Yeah.
That's right.
The start of the second examwas around three in the afternoon.
We only have twenty-five ortwenty-six hours left.
There may already besome teams that have passed.
That means...
I wonder if it'll be broiled soon.
We're soon going to be in a hot spot...
That's the biggest one.
Believe it!
Okay...
Even if we were to try pursuit,
there's probably hardly anybody leftto become targets.
What do we do?
Almost everyone's surely already passed.
Yeah. It's already beenfour days, after all.
Anyway...
It's early afternoon now...
Let's have a meal.
You two rest a bit andI'll go find us something to eat.
Say...
Hmm?
As I recall, on the other one...
"Heaven" was written here...
and unlike this,both edges of the scroll were whitish, right?
Umm, when I was shownthe scroll before the exam,
I wasn't really looking.
So, what of it all of a sudden?
Y-You've got to be kidding...?
For all we know...
there may not be any Heaven scrolls.
What do you mean, Sakura?
Well, in this second exam...
four of the five-daytime limit have passed already.
So that means we've alreadyused eighty percent of the total exam time.
Seventy-eight participantsand twenty-six teams.
There are only thirteen eachof the Heaven and Earth scrolls.
At most there are onlythirteen passing teams.
Moreover, you remember,don't you, Sasuke?
That the Orochimaru guy burnedthe "Heaven scroll" that we had.
Which means...
The teams that will pass had already,at that point, decreased by one.
Hmm?
Also, all of the other scrolls arenot necessarily safe, so...
After parting ways withthe Leaf Village bunch,
we allotted two days for healing...
So from here on, we have to increasethe distance of our actions.
At any rate,the next enemy is our last chance.
I'm going to get some drinking water.
Say! Say!
I have a good way for us not to fightwith an enemy. Believe it!
What?!
Get serious!
I am serious.
I have lots of scrolls stocked, so.
Ninjutsu manual, deadly poison manual,for notes....
If we tweak this a little and change itinto exactly like the Heaven scroll...
H-Hold it!
Huh?
Even if you did such a thing,you don't know what's written on the inside!
If the Proctor looked insideyou will be discovered right away!
Idiot!
Generally with things like this,
there's a password orsomething written
and you can't get itunless you have both scrolls.
In other words...
to pass at the tower goal,we'll surely need a password.
Or something like that.Believe it!
What difference does it make?
If you don't know the content,there's no use making a fake!
Man, here I was wondering whatyou were going to say, looking all big...
You're an idiot who just can'tthink through things.
B-But...
What if we could predict the content...?
This Earth scroll...
You wouldn't...
I'm going to... open this scroll!
No!
You! Have you forgotteneven the rules, you idiot?
We were told not to look inside the scrollsuntil arriving at the tower, right?
But, at this rate,we'll be in a hot spot, right?
There might be a trap or something.
Carefully... Be careful.
Yeah.
I know...
Hey, what's wrong?
Hey!
What's wrong?
What happened?!
Hey!
Hey!Answer me!
You'd best not do it.
An enemy?
Man, you're beyond saving...
That was close.
W-We're sorry.
Those who ignored the rules are forcedinto the situation of having to retire.
In the previous exam, hypnotismJutsu Formula was set up to
get into the eyes of those who lookedat the scroll along the way.
A measure to get them to liein the forest until the end of the exam.
By the way...
If I'm not mistaken, you're Kabuto, right?
What're you doing hangingaround here alone?
It's not that I'm after your scroll.
I didn't think so.
If that was your intention...you could've taken it from Naruto just now.
So you're also after the Heaven scroll?
No.
I already have them both.
See?
What?
Things led to things...
I was hurrying over tothe vicinity of the tower
to wait for my estranged companions.
Now, if you'll excuse me...
Wait!
Fight me.
Lucky!
Fight you, you say?
S-Sasuke.
This idiot-suke.
What are you saying suddenly?
Are you serious?
Sorry, but we don't have anymore time.
Hey, Sasuke!Kabuto saved us!
Sasuke, I don't know about that, myself.
Shut up!
Sasu... ke.
It can't be helped.I said it before, too.
This is all that can be doneto survive through this forest now.
Hmm...That's a lie.
A lie?
Your heart isn't totally in thisas much as you're saying.
If you could really becomeserious about this exam...
Why is it necessary to fight me?
You should jump on meat my unguarded moment,
without going tothe trouble of announcing it.
That's...a Ninja.
Hmm, that's profound.
I don't dislike that side of you.
So I shall tell you the way you should go.
However...let's talk as we move.
The smell of broiled fish in the fire smokehad reached a great distance.
At this rate, we'll be markedby fierce animals...and enemies.
Humph!
Are there really still enemies around?
Yes, no mistake.
If you think about it a little,you'll understand.
Do you know the cleverest wayof fighting in battles
in jungles andexpansive forests such as this?
No.
The tower located in the centerof this forest,
the common goal for us test-takers.
That means when the last dayof the test is here...
the area near that tower isthe easiest place to gather scrolls.
Oh, I see.Ambush, right?
In other words, we go after the scrollsof the teams
that have both the Heaven and Earth scrollsand are setting out for the tower.
That's one-third of the answer.
What?
I mean that you guys arenot the only ones thinking that!
Near the tower, the same badgershave probably already set traps, so...
I see!
That means there are lots of enemieslying in wait to engage us.
Heh, having a handicapgets me pumped, I say!
I'm looking forward to it!
If we just beat them all andget the Heaven scroll,
we'll all survive the second exam!
No! This is still two-thirds of the answer!
What's the remainingone-third of the answer?
The collectors who are certainto appear during an exam of this nature.
Collectors?
In this exam, with the towerjust a stone's throw away,
you definitely can't rest easy...
Those particular conditionsare what create them.
In other words,those who gather extra scrolls...
as compensation for sparing themwhen coming across an unexpected enemy.
Also, those who get information toproceed favorably through later exams
by providing the lacking scrolls tocomrades sharing the same village.
And those who are thinking of,under conditions favorable to them,
annihilating the powerful ones whowill probably get through to the third exam.
It goes without saying,but these guys are quite the big guns
and the worst enemies whoare definitely not conceited.
I see.
I understand the reasonwhy you appeared before us.
You're scared, too, right?
That's right.
Now then, the tower has finallycome into view.
From here on is the hard part.
All right, let's go!
An enemy already?
There!
Oh, it's just a centipede.
Yikes! It's huge.
All those legs are gross.
Naruto.
Huh?
I'd like to avoid inadvertent sounds andcareless actions from here on.
Huh?
Rushing ahead through a dense forestmaking noise like an elephant
is the same as serving noticein a loud voice that we're coming.
We'd definitely receivean enthusiastic welcome.
O-Oh, I see.
As long as time allows, we shouldgo slowly while remaining hidden.
- Yeah.- Okay.
Sure.
Heh, not bad, everyone.
Oh?
Okay, it's this way.
Is it a trap?
Yeah. It'll get intense ahead from here on.
Kabuto!
H-Huh?
That was close, Naruto.
Substitution Jutsu!
I told you, it would get intense aheadfrom here on.
I've... had it...
Oh! Sakura!
For crying out loud,how far have we walked?
The tower hasn't gotten a bit closer.
Here we can see it rightin front of our eyes.
Strange...
No mistake about it.
It seems that we're alreadywithin the enthusiastic welcome.
Take a look at that.
Oh, that can't be!
What on earth is going on?
No way!
Is it Genjutsu...?
So it seems.
We were lured in perfectly.
It appears we weremeticulously careful,
and were made to walk aroundthe same place in a circle.
We're being watched...
Probably.
They intend to wear downour physical strength and
catch us unpreparedwhen we're bone-tired.
If so, then this follows the enemy strategy.
Then... they'll be coming soon.
They've appeared.
Hah!
This is the perfect handicap.
Hey, can you hear it?
The clear, blue sky goes on and on
The ocean spans limitlessly
Please keep that smile on your face forever
Or else I'll cry
You won't have to search around you
It's all ok now.
Everyone is insidethis hand
when you want to cry, and you want to run away
When you forget what happiness is
Just sing.
Light is born, and darkness was born
The two are one
Harmonia, feel the telepathy
Hey, can you hear it?
What's with these guys?
Crawling out all of a sudden?
Fighting in numbers isn't necessarilya good thing, you know?
Since it's come to this,
it'll be a comparison ofthe number of Clone Jutsu.
I can get twice of twice oftwice of twice of your...
Anyway, I'll multiplyto an incredible number!
It doesn't matter if it'syour Genjutsu or whatever.
I'll kick all their butts!
Next episode: "Clone vs. Clone:Mine are Better than Yours!"Press down hard on the gas
That's right, there's no compromise
We'll slip through the night
At the final moment push hard
That's right, all the way to zero,
Until we wipe away the days
Gently open your heart
If you pull it close to you
It will reach you, without a doubt
It will come, closer
Now
We're speeding through life,squeezing it for all of its worth
Our feet are tied
But we still keep going farther
Even if I take it back, and grasp it
If you're not the one
There will be no meaning
And so we'll go far off into the distance.

Hey... Closet pervert.
Leaf Village Secret Finger Jutsu...
One Thousand Y ears of Death!
He's totally knocked out...He's weak, sure enough.
What's with that big frog?What the heck are you?
Thank you for asking me!
Know me as the Mountain Toad...spirit sage who acquires immortality,
also commonly called theToad Mountain Sage.
Long Time No See:Jiraiya Returns!
M-Mountain Sage?
Exactly.
Hey... Pervy Sage,what're you going to do about this?
Here, he was supposed towatch my training.
You did that to him.
He interfered with my research.
Research?
I'm a writer.I'm writing a novel.
This is it.
Make-Out Paradise
Oh, that is...!
You know this?
I've gotten quite famous.
That's not much of a novel!
In the first place,what research you are talking about?
You're just peeking at the girls' bath!
- Yikes!- No!
Idiot, idiot... idiot!My peeking has been found out.
You pervert.
F-Fool! I'm not just a pervert.
I get inspired by peekingand can write better pieces.
Liar! No excuses.
More importantly, what're yougoing to do about my training?
You mean the walking-on-water techniqueyou were doing earlier?
You know it?
Then take responsibilityand join my training.
Humph. I don't care about such things.
Hey, hey wait, Pervy Sage!
Join my training, hey!
Shut up! I hate people whodon't know how to talk properly...
And I don't like men.
Oh, umm, umm...
That Make-Out Paradise wasreally exciting, cool and interesting.
The purchase or viewing of that novel isprohibited for those 1 8 years or younger...
You liar.
The reviews that I've heard are great.
It's useless to flatter me.I'm a sage!
I'm not the type of fool who canbe coaxed by a fledgling like you.
Oh, hey...wait!
Farewell, kid.
Wow! He's cool eventhough he's a pervert.
Heeey, Pervy Sage!
Where'd he go?
What're you doing,you old pervert?
No, no, I'm sorry, miss...but what lovely breasts...
Pervert!
This grown-up is disgraceful.
Maybe there's nothing special about him,after all.
But there's nobody else.
Good grief...
As usual, the women inthis village are strong-minded.
However, that's makes them so good.
"As usual"?Meaning you've come here before?
You.
And you did nothing but peeping, right...?
You Pervy Sage!
Don't say pervert, pervertin such a loud voice.
Shut up!
So I bet that one shot onthe closet pervert was a fluke...
Anyway, I 'll have you take responsibilityfor ruining my training! Whoa...
Jeez, you're a noisy brat.
Hey!
Be quiet inside here for awhile.
Hey! Let me out, you jerk!
I want to have a romantic encounterwith a stacked girl.
How dare you do that to me earlier!
Substitution Jutsu.
Sure enough,he's not an ordinary old man.
Humph! That punk...
It's a million years too soonfor that kid to take me on.
Not really.
It seems you have a bit of talent.
Then you'll watch my training?
Give and take!
I'm not averse to listeningto your favor
as long as you listen to mine.
So which is it?
Listen up...
Nice ripe fruit that looks like this,like this and this.
I'll watch your trainingif you bring me that.
You really will, right?
This Toad Mountain Sage doesn't lie.
Okay, wait!
Plans are plans.They don't necessarily have to happen...
Hello there, you ladies!
Oh my... You're funny, old man.
No-no, this is the solemn truth.
Yeah, and then,what happened then?
Hey, Pervy Sage!
Oh no! Pervy Sage, he said.
You fool! Who's a Pervy Sage?
I brought the promised item.
Nice ripe fruit..
Idiot, idiot, idiot, idiot!That's not IT!
Looks good!
Don't hesitate. Help yourself.
Thanks.
No!
Where'd the ladies go?!
I got my fill...
Ladies...
No doubt about it. That person is...
Good grief. I've wasted time...
Hold it! Where are you going?!What about my training?!
I don't care! My precious researchhas been ruined thanks to you.
Research, my butt!I can't be standing around here, either!
I'm going to train hard,become stronger than anybody,
pass the Chunin exam,
and then I'll exceed the Hokage!
Humph! I don't care about such things.
Here all you do is get in my way...
Jeez, what a repugnant brat!
Stacked girls like the onesfrom earlier
are indispensable formy great writing enterprises!
I see... So I should bringsome stacked girls, right?
Okay.
W-Wow...!
If you gaze at me like that...I feel embarrassed.
Oh...!
What a...
What a cute girl.
I like you!
You pass!
Idiot.
You're really my type of girl.What's that technique called?
It's called Sexy Jutsu.
Oooh, what an idea. You're a genius.
I get the feeling all adults arereally affected by this technique.
Then you'll watch my training?
Sure! However, I have a condition.
A condition...? What is it?
A-Always be... in that formwhen you're in front of me!
Hey! Sure enough,you're just a pervert! You Pervy Sage!
No! I'm not just a pervert!
As if you didn't know!
I'm a super pervert!
Darn it... He's gone defiant...
Well, brushing off the stuff untilnow as a joke,
I'll watch your training.
You mean it, right?
A sage doesn't go back on his word.
Okay, kid.
Do that training that you weredoing before one more time.
Okay!
Okay.
Darn it.
Totally worthless.
Shut up!
It's pointless to wear clothes.
Hey, build up your Chakraone more time.
One more time?
Just do it, quick.
You!
What?
You're pretty sexy whenyou're naked.
Jeez. I'm concentrating,so don't interfere.
Oh, sorry, sorry. Continue.
You're messing with my focus.
I see...So this is The Seal Formula.
Two Tetragram Sealsmaking a Double Tetragram Seal...
Is this an 8-Signed Seal Formula?
Nine-Tailed Chakra is leakingfrom between the Tetragram Seals...
and is fixed so that itcan return to this kid's Chakra.
Fourth Hokage...
It's to protect this kid, huh?
But after that, it's stoppedwith a Five-Pronged Seal...
Putting Odd-Numbered Sealover Even-Number Seals...
This kid's Chakra and that ofthe Nine-Tailed are discreetly intermingled
and are not stable.
No wonder he is not able tobuild up Chakra very well.
That tickles... old man.
Oh, sorry, sorry.
Perhaps someone else...did it...
The formula is rough.
Well, it's probably Orochimaru.
Kid, give me a hurrah.
What?
Just hurrah. Come on, hurrah.
Jeez, he's demanding.
Five-Pronged Seal... Release!
What're you doing?!
Well, I just pushedthe pressure points for relaxing.
Just try walking onthe water once more...
Sheesh!
What?
I don't know why, but it's going well!
Yahoo!
I guess it's about time to teach himhow to control the Nine-Tailed Chakra.
Okay, kid. Come on out.
I'll teach you an ace technique.
What, what ace technique?A deadly technique?
There's something you need tounderstand well
before I teach you techniques.
You probably haven't noticed,but you possess two types of Chakra.
Huh? Two types?
Until now, have you everfelt a special Chakra?
Special? Hmm...
Come to think of it...
Come to think of it,I get the feeling there were times when...
Chakra suddenly sprang upand an awesome power came out.
But... I don't really remember those moments.
I see.
But I do remember sensing thatit was different
from the Chakra I always build up.
If I liken it to colors,
while it's always blue...
it felt like it was red or something.
I see.
Okay. That's it for today's training.
What?! Already?
What happened to the ace technique?
I can still train.
With training, a watched pot never boils.
As long as we're here,let's have a bath...
Not just falling in...
Warms me up.
A drink after training's the best.
Say, say, Pervy Sage.
What kind of technique isthat ace technique?
You'll find out tomorrow.
Miser!
We'll turn into boiled frogs ifwe stay in here too long.
Ebisu, sorry for snatchingyour student.
It's okay. More importantly,I was surprised...
The Hokage has had us searchingall over for you
and we could never determineyour whereabouts.
To think you were in this village...
The Hokage will be pleased.
Did you tell the Third Hokage about me?
Not yet.
I see. That's for the best.
Sure enough, somethingabout Orochimaru?
No, unfortunately not.
What?
I just stopped by lookingfor material for my novel...
My nature is not to get myselfinvolved in trouble.
What are you saying?!You should know!
What is necessary to stop Orochimaru,known as one of the Sannin,
the legendary three Shinobi,
is the power of another Sannin!
Your power, Master Jiraiya!
One! First, Tyson jumps and slamdunks
Two! He kisses and hugs everyonerandomly and says "l LOVE YOU"
Three! Masala masters Yogabut hates curry
Four! Sanchez is a lousy bullfighter. Ole!
All over the world, the sky's smiling,so look up and smile too

Are you really happy
when you're always meeting to someone's expectations?
Even if you change to who you really wanna be
Will you always have a great smile?
Dreaming of only "the beginning," I wake up
and someday, I'll live on my own.
Yes, precious things are never in shape
You never know what it is when you get it or lose it
Yeah, turn your sadness into kindness, your uniqueness into strength

His opponent is that Neji, huh...?
The Final Round is altogether differentthan the preliminaries...
After all, Naruto may not be able to...
Entertain me a little, Naruto.
I've got a tough job waitingfor me now, so...
Ultimate Defense: Zero Blind Spot!
Dang it. I can't catch him at all.
I told you I'm notsuch a fool, didn't l?
I already know...which one is the real one.
Oh.
That is the bodythat has least attacks
due to its fear of havingChakra Points attacked.
The more you attack,
the more that one bodybecomes clearly evident.
You're the real one.
Naruto...
This is as far as it goes.
I said it was pointless.
Don't let him beat you, Naruto.
I've been telling you notto frivolously assume things.
What?
It can't be.
All right! Go, Naruto!
Naruto...!
He foiled my idea and purposelyand drew one of his clones back?
I've been striking from the beginning,prepared for an honorable death!
Believe it!
I did it.
That's...
W-What was that?
Did you think you'd won?
Why?
Naruto's punch should've hit.
That...
Rotation...
That's Neji's defense.
You punk.Don't make a fool of me.
The largest range of vision ofeji's Byakugan is nearly 360 degrees.
And he detects all of his opponent'sattacks with the Byakugan.
His defense technique,the 8 Trigrams Palms Rotation,
will begin from here.
The moment he's attacked,he discharges a large amount of Chakra
from the Chakra holes in the body,blocks the enemy's attack with that Chakra,
moves his own body in a circular motion,dodges and repels.
Essentially, it's difficult to controlthe Chakra discharged from Chakra holes...
To the extent that even Jonin utilizethe discharge from a part of the body,
like the hands and feet,in techniques.
But Neji who has masteredGentle Fist discharges Chakra
from his entire body andshuts out physical attacks
just with that discharge power.
In other words,
that's one more absolute defense
that has more powerthan that Gaara's Sand Shield.
T-That's father's...
The Rotation is a secret Art passed downfrom generation to generation
only to the Hyuga head family,in other words the Hyuga clan.
He created that on his own...?
He's quite the guy...To think he'd come this far.
It's much too soon to be surprised.eji's true power is still to come.
Dang it.
This is the end.
You're within the area of my 8 Trigrams.
Gentle Fist Art.
8 Trigrams 64 Palms.
It can't be.
That pose.
8 Tetragrams...
... 2 Palms!
4 Palms.
8 Palms.
16 Palms.
32 Palms.
64 Palms!
The branch family exceedsthe head family?
It's over.
Truly a terrifying talent.
To think the power of theHyuga Kekkei Genkai
would be passed on so stronglyto a child of the branch family
who would never be ableto be an heir.
Hizashi... You should havesucceeded the Hyuga family.
I pressed the 64 Chakra Pointsall over your body...
You can't even stand.
D-Dang it.
Are you frustrated?
Kneeling down before powerthat can't be changed
and knowing your powerlessness.
Your dreams will come trueif you just work hard.
That's just an illusion.
Hey, Hinata. Are you okay?
Oh, man. I knew it.
Naruto.
Bushy brow...
Hinata.
D-Dang it.
Oh.
Naruto.
He... No way.
I told you, didn't l...?
I don't know when to give up.
No way.
Hey, you're bleeding.
What's wrong?
You've still got damagefrom the match.
Hinata... Hang in there.
I'll take a look at her.
Who're you?
I'm not suspicious or anything.
Stop already...
It'll be the same even ifyou fight more than this.
I don't have a grudge particularlyagainst you.
S-Shut up...
Even if you say so,I have something against you.
What are you talking about?
Why...? Here you're this strong...
Why did you, with a look likeyou've seen through it all,
go after Hinata mentallywho was trying so hard?
It has nothing to do with you.
Mocking Hinata, selfishly labelingher a failure as you please.
Head family, branch family...
I don't know what happened to you.
But I won't forgive the jerk who'dcall another person a failure.
Hey, you.
It's okay. I'm a doctor.
Okay... Fine.
If you insist, I'll tell you aboutthe Hyuga's destiny of hatred.
In the Hyuga head family,there's a secret Ninjutsu
that's been passed onfrom generation to generation.
That is the Curse Mark Arts.
Curse Mark Arts?
The Curse Mark representsa bird in a cage...
and it's a mark of those who arebound to a destiny they can't escape.
W-What's...
...t-that mark?
One day when I was four years old,
this accursed mark was inscribedon my forehead with the Curse Mark Arts.
A large ceremony was held inthe Village Hidden in Leaves on that day.
It was also the day when thehead Ninja of the Land of Lightning,
the land that the Leaf hadfought with for many years,
came for the conclusionof the allied treaty.
However, there was one clan...
who didn't attend the ceremonythat was attended
by everybody else,from Leaf Jonin to Genin.
It was the Hyuga clan...
And it's because that daywas the day of hope
when the head family heirwas to turn three.
Miss Hinata's third birthday!
My father, Hizashi Hyuga,
and Miss Hinata's father who's over there,Lord Hiashi Hyuga, were twin brothers.
However, Miss Hinata's father,Lord Hiashi,
is the eldest son of the head familyborn into this world first.
And my father who was the second sonis a member of the branch family.
So Miss Hinata is already three...
Congratulations.
Thank you.
She's a cute girl, isn't she, father?
What's wrong, father?
Oh, it's nothing.
Then...
I'll be taking Neji under my care, Hizashi.
Yes.
When the head family heir grewand became three years old,
I had the Curse Mark imprinted on meand I became the bird in the cage.
And became the Hyuga branch family.
Why's it necessary to dosomething like that?
Why separate into a head familyand a branch family?
What does that weird mark mean?
This mark on my foreheadisn't just a decoration.
The pull of your legs is weak.
Yes.
Listen, Neji.
You will live to protect Miss Hinataof the head family
as well as the Hyuga power.
Yes, father.
Murderous Intent.
My head.
Father.
What's wrong, father?
Go home.I'll forgive the fool today only.
You're not to forget your destiny.
This Curse Mark is the absolute fearcalled death so to speak...
that was given to the branch familyby the head family.
The Secret Sign that thehead family members form easily
destroys the cerebral nervesof those in the branch family.
Of course, killing is easy.
And this mark only goes awayat time of death.
Sealing away the powerof the Byakugan.
The Hyuga family is the clan that possessesthe most distinctive Kekkei Genkai.
There's no end to those whotarget the secret of that distinctive power.
In other words, this Curse Markkeeps the branch family alive
only to protect the head familyand does not allow disobedience.
And it's an effective system createdto defend for eternity
the Kekkei Genkai called Byakugan.
And then, that incident occurred.
My father was killed bythe head family.
One night, Miss Hinata wassnatched up by someone.
At that time, Lord Hiashi immediatelyrushed off and killed the abductor.
Who do you think that person was...
who was in the shadows,and also wearing a mask?
It was the head ninja ofthe Land of Lightning
who had just completedthe allied treaty.
It was clear that he came targetingthe secret of Byakugan from the start.
However, the Land of Lightningexploited the killing of their own Ninja
due to a botched plan...
and set an outrageous condition inviolation of the treaty with the Hidden Leaf.
Naturally, things got worse and worse,
and there was almost a warbetween the Leaf and the Lightning.
However, the Leaf whowanted to avoid war
made a deal with the Lightning.
A deal?
The Lightning demand wasthe body of the Hyuga head family
who possesses Byakugan,the Kekkei Genkai...
In other words,the body of Lord Hiashi.
And the Leaf accepted the condition.
What? But, father...
And war was safely avoided.
Thanks to my father who was killedas a body double of Hiashi Hyuga,
to protect the head family!
Other than dying, there's no other wayto escape this accursed Curse Mark.
Even though they were twinswith nearly equal power,
their destinies were already set bywho was born first and born later.
And then, this match...
Your destiny was decided at the pointwhen I became your opponent.
One! First, Tyson jumps and slamdunks

Are all my Chakra Pointsreally closed?
Darn. I cannot feel any Chakraremaining in my body at all...
just like when I used up all my Chakrain my training with the Pervy Sage.
Wait. I got it. Just watch me!
I will squeeze outmy Chakra no matter what!
Next time, "A Failure's True Power."
C'mon!
Running like a fugitive,
Being chased by something
Inside my heart is pounding
My throat dry like it's withering
For no single one,
To none does belong,
This time is ours, right now...
Unraveling the pain,
Unraveling our hearts,
Unraveling shadows
Stifling our breath,
Reaching for beyond,
Tearing through the dark
In fighting and in love
To the distant light above,
Yes, we are on the way
I wanna rock...
I wanna rock...
Rockin' my heart
Hey, you there.
Identify yourself.
I'm not obliged to answer...
What...?!
Cute...
So those are Kakashi andGuy's treasured brats...
Well, for the time being,their applications will pass.
Yeah...
It appears this year'stest-takers will be amusing.
For us proctors too, eh...
Now then!Sasuke, Naruto, let's go!
Don't pull.
Sasuke... Sasuke Uchiha, eh.
Does that kid concern you?
Hmph...
Lee, let's go.
What're you doing?
You guys go on ahead.I have something I want to check out.
What's that about?
Why should I know?
You, with the unpleasant look.Wait a minute!
Huh?
- Oh!- Yikes!
What is it?
Why don't you fight with mehere now?
Chunin Challenge:Rock Lee vs. Sasuke!
A fight here now...?
Yes.
My name's Rock Lee.
When asking a person their name,
I'm supposed to givemy own name first, right?
Sasuke Uchiha...
Hmph... So you knew?
I want to fight with you!
I want to test out how effectivemy techniques will be
against the descendant of theclan reputed for genius Ninjas.
Also...
Sakura. Love.
Noooo!Those lower eyelashes are awful!
The hairstyle is awful, too!
Those bushy eyebrows,just too intense!
Everything is...!
You're an angel!
Noooooo!
You are good at it.Then, how about...?
Really... That was super close.
You! Don't throw strange stuff!
I was dodging for my life!
You don't have to resent me that much.
It's Sasuke again!Darn it! Darn it!
To be honest, you're a naive one,
knowing the name of Uchihaand challenging me.
Do you want to realizewhat this name is, Bushy-Brow?
I insist.
I'm lucky...
to be able to have a bout withthe number one rookie right away.
And, I'll prove it to you, Guy Sensei!
Wait!
I AM going to take outthe Bushy-Brow. Believe it!
Hey, you...!
Big deal.
I'll be able to take care of himin just five minutes!
The one I want to fight isn't you...It's Uchiha.
All these people...
keep saying Sasuke, Sasuke.How annoying!
Darn it!
Leaf Whirlwind!
As I thought, he's strong...
I declare. You are absolutelyno match for me.
Because...
among the Leaf Village Genin,I'm the strongest now.
He stopped my kick...
What's with that Chakra in his arm...?
Interesting. I'll do it.
Oh...
Stop! Sasuke!
There's less than thirty minutesuntil the 3:00 registration.
Don't worry.
It'll be over in five minutes.
Here he comes!
I'm sorry, Guy Sensei.
I may end up breaking the taboo.
I may end up using...that technique!
Leaf Hurricanes!
I can't get completely outof the way...
Guard!
What...?!
Sasuke!
W-What's going on?
But...he did guard himselfjust now, no mistake.
He got around my guard.
What is it?
Is it Ninjutsu...?Or is it Genjutsu...?!
As I thought, he's going to get up!
Hmph... That's okay.
If that's the case,
this is a good opportunityto get used to THAT.
I'll do it.
Huh?! C-Could that be...?
Sharingan!
Sasuke, when has he...Why is that in his eyes...
And in both eyes...!
Is that the Sharingan?
Sasuke's awesome, after all!
If this is the same Kekkei Genkaias Kakashi Sensei's...
he can read Bushy-Brow's Jutsu!
Genjutsu or Ninjutsu...
It's some kind of magic either way...I'll reveal that!
It feels like Sasuke's rapidlygetting stronger.
That's to be expectedof the Uchiha clan.
That's right...Sasuke should not lose to a guy like this.
Huh?!
The Sharingan...!
To not be able to discern the Jutsuwith the Sharingan...
Could it be...that his technique is...!
That's right...
My technique is neitherinjutsu nor Genjutsu.
S-Sasuke!
That's right!
My technique ismere Taijutsu...Sasuke.
You may not be able tobelieve it just like that, but...
Punk!
It's said that the Sharingan hasthe ability to spot
all Genjutsu, Taijutsu and Ninjutsu.
Make no mistake,
the Sharingan reads Ninjutsuand Genjutsu that
require the principle of building upChakra and weaving Signs,
and can most surely handle such Jutsu.
However, only Taijutsu isa little bit different...
W-What do you mean?!
Even if you can spot my movementswith the Sharingan,
your body is not equipped withthe speed to respond to my Taijutsu.
In other words, even if you understandwith your eyes,
there's nothing you can do if yourbody can't keep up.
Do you know?
There are two types of strong people,genius-types and effort-types.
If your Sharingan isa genius-type drawing Uchiha ability...
I'm an effort-type who haspatiently mastered only Taijutsu.
In a manner of speaking,
your Sharingan and my ultimateTaijutsu have the worst compatibility...
Guard!
Huh?! Dancing Leaf Shadow...!
And I shall prove it with this technique.
Prove that effort exceeds the genius.
W-What's he going to do...?!
It's my victory!
Huh?! Dancing Leaf Shadow!
And I shall prove it with this technique.
Prove that effort exceeds the genius.
W-What's he going to do...?!
It's my victory!
Huh?!
- Huh?- Huh?!
That's...!
That's as far as it goes! Lee!
W-What is it...?What's going on?
Sasuke!
Sasuke was beaten?!
What happened whileI was knocked out?!
Are you okay?! Sasuke.
He's agitated...To think he couldn't fall properly.
Y-You were watching...?
Lee! That technique just nowis prohibited, you know!
W-What's with that turtle...?
I-I'm sorry.I didn't mean to...
He's...getting scolded or something...
Could that be...Bushy-Brow's teacher?!
B-But, of course,
I didn't even remotely havea mind to use the Hidden technique...
There's no mistake!
- Huh?- Huh?
Hey-hey.
What...?
That thing... It's a turtle, right...?Right?
Isn't it obvious?!
Say! Say! Can even a turtlebecome a Ninja teacher?
I don't know!
Fool!
You think such subterfuge will work?!
You should know very well whatit means
for a Shinobi to give awayhis technique!
I... I know.
To think I lost to someone so flippant...
Have you prepared yourself?
Y-Yes sir...
All right, if you will, Guy Sensei!
Man! Life treating you good, huh?
Huh?!
Whoaaa! An even moreintense guy has appeared!
Yo, Lee!
Super intense.The extreme bowl cut...
T-Those are some incrediblyraging brows...
I've never seen anything like thatin my life.
H-Hey! You guys!Don't mock Guy Sensei!
Shut up!
I'm at a loss for a reaction because
of those bizarre things appearingone after another!
What?!
Hey, Lee! Drop it!
Yes, sir...
Idiot!
Lee, you... you...
S-Sensei...!
L-Lee...
Sensei... I... I...
Enough, Lee!Don't say anything!
Sensei!
Lee!
I lost to a guy like that...
Yes... this is adolescence!
Sensei!
That sort of tone's kind of nice, too.
I-ldiot! That's dangerous!Very dangerous!
It's okay, Lee!
Mistakes come with adolescence.Don't worry about it!
You're so kind...Sensei!
Now then, take a hundred laps aroundthe Training Field toward that setting sun!
Yes! Sensei!
Let's go!
Yes, sir!
Hey, wait a minute.
We're still in the middleof the conversation!
What're you going to doabout the Chunin Exam?!
There's no time!
Huh? Oh, that's right...
Lee, you will be punished for attemptingto break the prohibition on top of fighting...
in principle, afterthe Chunin Exam.
Okay!
Five hundred howls of adolescence!
Yes, sir!
Idiots...
Say! Say!
By the way, what's with that turtle?
If I'm not mistaken, those kids are...
Kakashi's...
Oh! No, he's looking this way!
You guys... how's Kakashi Sensei?
You know Kakashi...?
I know him all too well.
People call us...eternal rivals.
Sounds like a lie!
What're you saying?!Guy Sensei really is...
That's fine.
"Action speaks louder than words"anyway.
Huh?!
By the way, my record is fifty winsand forty-nine losses.
Huh?!
This guy...
When did he...?
One thing, I'm stronger than Kakashi...
N-No way...
He's fast! He's faster than Kakashi!Is he human...?!
How about that?!Guy Sensei is awesome, isn't he?!
Darn it...
This time around,Lee caused the trouble.
Out of consideration for my face,forgive him.
Out of consideration forthis pleasant face.
He's better than that Kakashi...?
Darn it! He's...
not just all talk...
You guys and Lee should probably goto the classroom pretty soon.
He...!
Then, do your best, Lee!Farewell!
Yes, sir.
What?!
Sasuke...
I have one last thing to tell you.
I actually came here toverify my own ability.
I lied before.
The strongest man of theLeaf Village Genin might be on my team.
I'm entering in orderto defeat that person.
And, you are one of my targets.
Please prepare yourself for the Exam!
Sasuke...
Ha! So...
I guess Uchiha clan's not all that, huh?
Naruto!
Shut up!
I'll knock him flat next time!
Ha! That from someonewho just got whipped.
Hey...what's your problem?!aruto, you!
You saw it, didn't you? His hand...
That Bushy-Brow probably did a heckof a lot of special training.
Day after day...
More than you have...
That's all it is.
Sasuke...
Interesting...
Hmph!
It's starting to get interesting...the Chunin Exam!
What's next?
Yeah!
All right!
Let's go, Naruto! Sakura!
Yeah!
Whoaaaa!There are tons of people here!
Are they all here to takethe Chunin Exam?
Ino, Shikamaru, Choji, Kiba,Shino, Hinata and Rock Lee?
So you're all here, too?
Yeah, I'm pumped, pumped, pumped!
Open up your eyes and watch mebecome the Hokage!
Next episode:"Genin Takedown!All Nine Rookies Face Off!!"
As for me,I'm going to kick butt once again!
C'mon!
Running like a fugitive,
Being chased by something
Inside my heart is pounding
My throat dry like it's withering
For no single one,
To none does belong,
This time is ours, right now...
Unraveling the pain,
Unraveling our hearts,
Unraveling shadows
Stifling our breath,
Reaching for beyond,
Tearing through the dark
In fighting and in love
To the distant light above,
Yes, we are on the way
I wanna rock...
Rockin' my heart
You're an embarrassmentto our village.
Why do you think we came allthe way here to Leaf Village?
P-Please listen to me, Gaara.
T-They lashed out first...
Shut up!
I'll kill you.
U-Understood, I was wrong.
I-I'm sorry...I'm really sorry.
I'm sorry about that...
This guy...has a nasty look.
To think he was able to hitthat Kankuro
with a tiny rock with great ease.
This guy's...good.
Let's go.
We didn't come hereto play around.
I know.
Hold it!
What is it?
Judging from your headbands,
you're Ninjas from the VillageHidden in the Sand, right?
Without question, the Land of Fire andthe Land of Wind are allied nations.
But the arbitrary coming andgoing of Shinobi
is supposed tobe prohibited by the treaty.
State your purpose!
Depending on circumstances...
Hmph! So this is what they mean
by the darkest place beingunder the candlestick.
Don't you know anything about it?
My permit!
As you say, we're Sand Village Geninsfrom the Land of Wind.
We came to this village totake the Chunin Exam.
Chunin Exam...?
Identify Yourself:Powerful New Rivals
What is the Chunin Exam anyways?
You really don't knowanything, do you?
Bro, if you pass the exam,you can become a Chunin from a Genin!
I see! Then, maybe I'll try taking them!
Heh!
Hey! You there...
What's your name?
Huh? M-Me?
No! The gourd next to you!
I'm Gaara of the desert...
I have an interest in you as well...
What's your name?
Sasuke Uchiha.
Say! Say! What about me?What about me?
Not interested.
Heh! Things have gotten interesting.
Konohamaru, do I look weak?
Compared to Sasuke, yes...
Sasuke, I won't lose to you!
What's gotten into you,all of a sudden?!
What do you think?
I don't think they're anything special.
But the black-haired one from Leaf Villageand the gourd from the Sand Village...
those two need to be checked.
Now then, in conjunctionwith beginning the Chunin Exam,
Iet us first have those in chargeof the rookie Genin come forward.
Kakashi and Kurenai and Asuma...
So? Are there any Genin fromyour squads
you wish to recommendfor these exams?
It goes without saying,
but if it's a Genin who has carried outeight or more formal missions,
you can recommend themfor the exams if you wish.
Well, as a general rule,
having carried out more than twicethat amount of missions is appropriate.
There's no need to hear this...
It's too soon for them.
Then, you first Kakashi.
The Kakashi-led Group Seven...
Sasuke Uchiha. Naruto Uzumaki.Sakura Haruno.
I, Kakashi Hatake, recommend thesethree for the Chunin Exam.
Huh?
The Kurenai-led Group Eight...
Hinata Hyuga, Kiba lnuzuka,Shino Aburame.
These three, l, Kurenai Yuhi,recommend the same.
The Asuma-led Group Ten...
Ino Yamanaka, Shikamaru Nara,Choji Akimichi.
These three, l, Asuma Sarutobi,recommend the same.
All three recommended...
To think rookies will bein the Chunin Exam...
Hasn't it been five yearssince that's happened?
Hmm...
Wait a minute!
What is it, lruka?
Lord Hokage, please let mesay one thing.
This may be presumptuous,
but as for the nine namesthat were given,
I was in charge of them at the Academy.
Admittedly, they were all studentswith ability,
but it's too soon...!
They should be tested afterhaving gained more experience!
I became a Chunin when I wassix years younger than Naruto is now.
Naruto is different from you!
Is it your intent to crush Naruto?!
They always do nothing but complainabout important missions...
Teaching them a lessononce would be fun.
Trying to crush themwould be interesting, too.
W-What did you say?!
Well, joking aside...
Iruka Sensei...
I understand what you want to say.
It's aggravating, I know.However...
Kakashi...
Don't do it.
Stay out of this!They're not your students anymore!
Now they're my subordinates!
Man...troublesome people.
B-But the Chunin Examis also known as...
Iruka...
I understand your point.
Master Hokage...
Therefore, I have decided to conduct
a special preliminary examfor these rookie Genins.
P-Preliminary exam...?!
Say! Say! Say!
Why is it that he's the one whoalways calls us out,
and then makes us wait?!
That's right! That's right!
What's he going to do aboutthe feelings of a maiden
who accidentally overslept and resignedherself to no blow-drying?!
I overslept, so I haven't washed my faceand didn't brush my teeth.
Y-You...That's dirty.
Why're these guys so hyperfirst thing in the morning?!
Hey, good morning, folks!
Today, I got a bit lost on the path of life...
Right! That's a lie!!
Uh, well...
This is sudden, but I recommendedyou guys for the Chunin Exam, so...
Here, these are your applications.
Chunin Exam...
That being said, the recommendationsare not compulsory.
You guys are free to decide whetheryou take the Exam or not.
All right! I love you, Kakashi Sensei!
Hey, cut it out. Get away already...
Only those who want to take the Exam,sign that application and
come to Room 301 of the Academyat 3:00 p. m. five days from now...
That's it!
Chunin Exam! Chunin Exam!
Chunin Exams, eh...
I bet lots of strong guys would be there...
For example, that guy!
And this guy!
Okaaay! I won't lose toanybody no matter what!
If I take the first place, the path tothe Hokage is right there!
Sure enough, it's decided that Narutowill be the Hokage...
I'll just retire my elderly self at once.
Yaaaay!
I might be able to fight him.
I... don't want to...
Here I can't...
keep up with Sasuke,and not even with Naruto...
The Chunin Exam, no way...
Oh, Brother Naruto! Let's play!
Sure. I don't have any missions today,so I'll play with you guys!
Yaaay!
Oh!
Leader! Konohamaru!
What're you going to do with Moegi?!
Hey, you! Let Moegi go!
Darn!Let's follow them, Konohamaru!
Y-Yeah!
W-Wait!
Chunin Exams, eh...
Yo.
S-Sasuke, what's up?
How about we go for a little walk?
No way! For real?!
Well well... So you can keep upat this speed, eh?
Wait for me! Moegi!
Bro, where'd you go?
I think we are lost.
Nooo! Let me go!
Even the strongly fortifiedVillage Hidden in the Leaf...
is mine if I slip in themiddle of Chunin Exam's ruckus.
Hmm?
That was fast...
Hey! You fat old man!
What're you going to do with Moegi?
What am I going to do, you ask?
You want to know?
Wha--?!
Don't move!
If you do,the brat's dead meat!
Y-You. Why're you doing this?!
I want the first Hokage'sScroll of Sealing!
If you bring it to me,I'll return the brat!
Scroll of Sealing...
Umm...
Sasuke...
What's up, all of a sudden?
Sakura...
Give up on the Chunin Exam...It's too early for you.
Is it...?
I thought so...
The Chunin Exam isa gathering of top dogs...
You might die if you're not careful...
Sasuke...
So you're worried about me, right?
Yeah... kind of...
What a display of affection, eh?
Get lost! If you don't want to die.
Don't talk as if you know everything!
Don't make me angry!
Sasuke!
Don't take me lightly!
Sasuke!
Sasuke?
Sasuke!
Sasuke!!
What're you doing?
Hurry up and bring methe Scroll of Sealing!
What'll happen... if I say, heck no?
You don't care what happensto this brat?
Heh, I'm fine with whatever happensto that bunch of straw, I say.
Wha--?!When did he do that?!
I've taken Moegi back from you,thank you!
As expected great leader!Moegi respects you.
Darn it! The Clone Jutsu, huh...?
You don't know when to give up!
Naruto!
Hey! You're late, Konohamaru!
Konohamaru, I was scared.
Oh, there-there...
Leader, did you catch him?
Yup, as you can see!
Huh? What?!
Oh, it's the Substitution Jutsu!
Dang it! When did he switch?!
I see...
If you don't want to turn outlike this,
you'll give up onthe Chunin Exam, too.
Sasuke, don't die...!
Big mistake if you thinkI'd say that.
I was aware of this Genjutsuright from the start!
What?!
The real Sasuke wouldn't dosomething like
invite me to go for a walk!
Don't make me saysuch frustrating things!
That kind of elementary Genjutsuwon't work on me!
Did you say elementary...?
That's right!
Incidentally, I've seen through thatyou're also an illusion
and aren't really here!
I don't know about...
that!
See?
Just what I'd expect ofKakashi's subordinate.
However, this will become realityin the Chunin Exam!
I wonder if you can endure that...?
I'm not scared!I'll take them on anytime!
The Chunin Exam isn't...The Chunin Exam isn't...!
I'm still not sure if I can do it...
That was a stupid thing to do...
How was it?
We went to the trouble of havinga special preliminary exam,
but all nine of the rookies passed.
As you say, it appears their skillshave definitely improved.
Well, the actual Chunin Examwon't just end at this, but...
Hey, have you heard?
Rookies are going to bein the Chunin Exam
for the first time in five years.
No way.
It's probably just a Jonin battle of willsor something anyway.
No...
The story is that three among themare that Kakashi's unit.
That's interesting...
Well, be that as it may...
That's a sad story...
Sakura, you're late!
Yeah... sorry...
Morning, Sasuke.
Yeah...
Something's strange about Sakura.
So, are you sure you're goingto attempt taking
the Chunin Exam with that skill?
May it'd be best if you runts quit.
You're green-assed brats, after all.
Please let us through.
That's... mean...
What did you say?!
Listen!We're being nice to you!
The Chunin Exam is a high hurdle.
Many times have we seenpeople quit Shinobi
as well as people who weredisabled for life
just because they took this Exam.
Also, a Chunin is at the levelof a unit leader.
Mission failures,death of subordinates,
it's all part of theresponsibilities of a leader!
A brat such as this a Chunin?
What's so bad about weeding outthose who won't pass anyway?!
A just argument.
However, you will let me through.
And could you also immediatelyundo this barrier created with Genjutsu?
I have business on the third floor.
What's this guy talking about...?
I don't know...
- Well, well...- So you noticed, eh?
How about it, Sakura?
You should've beenthe first one to realize it.
Huh...?
Your analytical strength andGenjutsu know-how
has improved the most in our squad, so...
Sasuke...
Thank you...
Of course. I realized it ages ago!
You see, this is the second floor!
Yup!
Well, not bad...But all you've done is to catch on.
Right?!
H-He's fast!
This person...
He's a different person fromwhen he was getting punched before!
He stopped my kick...
What's with that Chakra in his arm?
Hey, this isn't what you promised.
You were the one who said
you didn't want to carelesslyattract attention and be watched.
But...
Oh boy...This again...
This guy...
The marks where he was hitare disappearing.
Was he faking?
My name's Rock Lee.Your name's Sakura, right...?
Huh?
Please go out with me!I'll protect you until I die!
Absolutely... not.
Huh?
You're...too intense.
Hey, you there.
Identify yourself.
Dang it! Again?
It's always about Sasuke!
When asking someone his name,give your own name first.
You're...a rookie, right?How old are you?
I'm not obliged to answer.
What...?
Cute.
Too intense, huh...
Uninterested, huh...
Now then!Sasuke, Naruto, let's go!
So those are Kakashi andGuy's treasured brats.
Well, for the time being,their applications will pass.
Yeah...
It appears this year's test-takerswill be amusing...
For us proctors too, eh.
Good grief...
This Chunin Exam...is full of monsters.
Bowl-cut, fuzzy eyelashesand bushy eyebrows.
Oh! It's you!
You're the overly intense guywho just got rejected by Sakura.
What's with your bizarregreen jumpsuit?
What? You want to challenge me,bushy-browed bumpkin?
I'll teach you that it's a million yearstoo soon to be doing that.
Next episode:"Chunin Challenge: Rock Lee vs. Sasuke!"
As for me,I'm going to kick butt once again!
