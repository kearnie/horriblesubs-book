So good...
This is so good!
This CD of yandere guys being verbally abusive is even better than I'd imagined!
Why are 
It's because you were talking to another guy.
What?!
Why is my phone ringing?!
Oh. Someone's actually calling me?
H-Hello?
Hey, Mokocchi. It's been a while.
Y-Yuu-chan?
U-Uh... I-It's been a while.
Wh-What's up?
Well...
Um, are you free this Saturday?
Yeah.
To your seats, kids!
Stand!
Bow!
Sit down!
Good morning!
Did everyone do their homework?
Tomo-chan, you eat so quickly!
You've got a grain of rice on your cheek! So cute!
Huh?
In this sentence, the word "something" means "a little."
Hey!
You smell something?
Yeah, totally! It smells like food!
It's only second period! Who could it be?
I'm so envious that the second years are on their school trip right now.
That'll be us next year.
Yeah, but...
By the way, what are we doing in art class today?
We'll be pairing up and drawing portraits.
Sorry!
Um, the ball...
Here.
Thank you!
The manager, huh?
Where should we go this Saturday?
Wanna come over to my place?
But your parents will be there.
Oh come on, who cares about them?
Hey, don't push!
You pushed me first.
But wouldn't your parents be surprised if I just show up out of nowhere?
It'll be fine. I told them not to come into my room anyway.
Can you promise me you won't try anything funny?
Of course! I'm, like, a saint!
Well, in that case...
I 
but I can't rememberanything but 
Nothing else.
I'm serious! He's actually got a life, you know.
I went to karaoke with Youhei and two girls from the class next door yesterday.
On our way home, we saw him holding hands with a girl!
For real?!
So 
Seriously, guys like that should just drop dead.
Oh, so that's why you tweeted"drop dead, normalfags" yesterday?
That made my day.
Th-This is purely for magical purposes!
Not for pleasure, okay?!
How dare you betray us!
We'll have you entertain us before we dispose of you.
Wh-What now? There are people watching...
Ah, sorry!
Hey, you pushed me way too hard! Are you nuts?
This announcement is for the following students.
Hatsushiba-kun from Class 1-7and Kuroki-san from Class 1-10.
Please report to Fukuura-sensei immediately in the staff room.
Did he say "womb"?
You two skipped art the other day, right?
Yes.
Y-Yes.
You're the only ones who haven'tcompleted the portrait assignment yet.
Stay after school and do it then.
I'm quite busy with club activities.
Of course, you don't 
but I don't 
Um...
Y-Yes?
Your classroom's that way.
Why are you following me?
I-I wasn't.
Is that so?
Then if you'll excuse me.
B-But I'm not done yet...
Fine, I'll half-ass mine, too.
I'm done.
This should do.
Thanks for bringing them to me.
Let's see...
Huh? What's this?
Oh right, the club he's in...
Um...
Hm?
U-Um... That drawing...
M-May I photocopy it?
Oh, that fatass—I mean, that young man!
So he was only behaving that waybecause he was shy?
I guess that explains why he was so blunt.
S-Since he's so desperate, I suppose I could become friends with him.
How should I tell Yuu-chan about all this?
Hey, Mokocchi!
Y-Yuu-chan?
Long time no see!
Let's go in.
O-Okay.
Excuse me, I'd like a mocha frappuccino—
What would you like, Mokocchi?
U-Uh, um...
A-A coffee. Iced coffee.
Sorry it took so long.
I-It's fine.
Mokocchi, you haven't changed a bit.
R-Really?
Y-You 
Yeah.
Everyone started dressing up in high school.
I started wearing contacts so I'd fit in better.
Right...
Mokocchi, do you still watch anime?
Y-Yeah, sometimes.
Really? Thank goodness!
I couldn't talk to anyone about that!
There's a lot of moeshit anime this season.
Really?
Slice-of-life anime is all they air these days, because of the new content restrictions.
I see.
There are some pretty interesting series, though!
Like that EFB show...
Yeah, yeah!
It really is a lot of fun hanging out with you.
Oh, well...
U-Um...
Oh yeah, I have something to show—
I wish...
middle school could've lasted forever.
H-Hey, Yuu-chan.
What?
Let's have fun like we did back in middle school!
Huh?
It's been forever since the last time I was here!
Oh, weren't you really good at this?
You should play a round!
I haven't played this in a long time!
Man, I'm not sure I can reach level 40!
Yeah, there's no way!
I'm a bit rusty, so who knows how far I'll get?
Press the buttons in time with the music!
Start!
Perfect!
Man, that totally...
totally wasn't...
even my best!
Feel free to catch your breath first.
Mokocchi, are you enjoying your high school life?
Yeah, sort of.
How nice.
I would've liked to go to the same school as you.
Huh?
If I had, I'm sure...
Yuu-chan?
We did a lot today.
Yeah.
Spending time with you is so much fun!
You think so?
Where do you want to go next?
Well, it's about time I went home.
I-I see.
I guess it is.
I had a great time today!
Can we hang out again sometime?
Yeah...
Of course!
Okay, I'll text you some time!
Thank you for such a great day!
Wait!
I thought things would be fun once I started high school,
but that wasn't the case at all!
But I'm still...
But I'm still hanging in there!
So...
So hang in there too, Yuu-chan!
Mokocchi! Thanks!
I can't believe I got so depressed over something so lame!
Getting into an argument with myfirst boyfriend is nothing to be sad about!
I'll keep at it!
Now that I think about it,this is the first argument we've—
It's all right.
You're all I need in this world.
You think so too?
Thank goodness!
Then let's go together...
to another world!
Hatsushiba.
What?
I'm grateful for your help,
but your background charactersall have the same face.
That face takes me the least time to draw.
Well, whatever.
Not like these characters matter anyway.
Right.
A classmate drew aportrait of me today.
It was...
qu-quite...
Wanna see?
Nope.
Rainy days are so depressing.
More like 
Morning!
Morning.
What's wrong? You seem kind of down.
Well, my hair gets all frizzy on rainy days,
and today the wind made it even worse.
My day is ruined.
Hey!
Morning!
S-See you.
Y-Yeah.
Geez, he was the last person I wanted to see today!
We're classmates, though.
I'm 
Come on, it's not 
Huh?
Huh?!
Class is starting!
Stand up!
Bow!
Sit down!
Here, the author claims that satireis an ephemeral kind of literature.
Why is that?
First, social satire is highly dependent on thetopics and events of the age it was written in.
Hey!
Where's your textbook?
Uh, um...
I left it at home.
Stand up.
Huh?
O-Okay.
Couldn't you borrow it from someone in another class?
U-Um... my friend doesn't have... modern lit today...
Then ask your neighbor to share his with you.
O-Oh...
O-Of course.
Are you playing the fool?!
I-I'm not!
Forget it. Sit down.
Get your neighbor to share his with you.
O-Okay.
Let's continue.
Uh, wanna share my textbook?
Yes... thanks.
Huh?
There it is.
It's raining so hard that the river'sall the way up to the bridge!
Wow!
Just a little more and it'll overflow!
Are you out of your goddamn mind?!
Come over here!
Why would you approach a flooding river?!
Do you have a death wish?!
I-I'm sorry...
Even junior high students know to stay away!
You're damn lucky I happened to pass by! You really are!
I-I'm... sorry...
Why me?
Honestly, what have I done wrong?
Damn, I'm soaked!
Just shut up and run!
This couldn't get any worse.
Why did it have to break?
Hey, your umbrella broke too?
Why are you talking to her out of the blue?
Why not?
Though whoa, looks like she's ignoring me.
Maybe she's just the quiet type.
It's... It's...
It's raining.
Oh...
Yeah, I guess it is.
Whoa, all this sweat...
It's like this is a basketball manga.
Huh?
Huh?
Wh-Whoa, all this sweat...
I-I'm sweating like a character out of a basketball manga!
Oh, were you talking to me?
No.
You're leaving? The rain's still pretty heavy.
U-Um...
I-I figured I'd go take a really messy shitin the bathroom or something.
Uh, sorry for asking.
I-I was kidding! I just gotta pee!
It was supposed to be funny.
I even stooped so low as to make a dirty joke...
My eyes are still red,
but if I don't go back soon,they'll think I really 
Oh, good thing she's still here.
She's asleep. Should we wake her up?
Nah, don't.
Let's just leave the umbrella here.
I can't believe you bothered to buy her an umbrella.
I'd feel bad if we left her behind like that.
Fair enough.
Is she even gonna notice it?
I'm sure she will. I left it right next to her.
Even if it's just once,
I want a boy to be nice to me.
I'm home.
Welcome back!
Oh no, Tomoki! Where's your umbrella?!
It broke.
Oh dear.
Go take a hot bath.
Okay.
Man, I'm freezing.
I need a towel, quick.
Hey, cut the crap!
Open it!
Come on, open up!
I'm gonna catch a cold!
Give me a towel! Come on!
Hey! Are you even listening?
Hey, Mom, where's Tomoki?
He's still asleep. Came down with a cold.
A cold?!
He has a fever, so he's staying home today.
All right. 
Okay, gather 'round!
Form teams of five and practice however you'd like.
Okay!
Let's team up!
Sure!
We're only four. Who should be the fifth?
Hey, wanna try a psychology test?
A psychology test?
Ooh, like what?
I saw it on TV yesterday.
Let's see...
In your dream, you're walking down a road.
The road splits into two paths.
One leads to a small grove,
and the other one leads to a forest.
Which way do you go?
One, go to the grove.
Two, go to the forest.
Or three, go back home because you're scared.
Number one for me.
I'd go with the third choice.
Number two it is.
Those who picked number three have already lost their virginity.
Oh, come on!
Then what about number one?
Number one is a pure virgin,
and number two is an unwanted virgin.
Are you okay?!
Wait! You mustn't move her!
I'll get the nurse!
I'm home.
Why are you home so early, Tomoko?
I collapsed during PE.
Are you okay now? Want to go see a doctor?
No, I should be fine if I get some rest.
I did it!
I successfully faked an illness!
But I really did pass out.
I should text Yuu-chan.
Done!
Now to spend the day playing video games!
Wait a sec...
Huh? What are you d—
Hey!
Hey...
I'll stay here with you.
What?
I'll stay by your side forever and ever.
I'll pass. Get lost.
Your sister's here in her uniform.
So what?
Not at all.
Seriously, what?
So you say, but your head down there says otherwise.
Do you have a screw loose or what?
Oh.
Are you feeling okay, Tomoko?
Y-Yeah.
I was bored, so I thought I'd nurse Tomoki.
I see.
Feed him these when he wakes up.
And change his towel periodically, too.
Tomoko, come down here!
I'm busy making porridge! Answer the door for me!
Okay.
I-I'm Kuroki-kun's—
I mean, Tomoki-kun's classmate.
I've brought him today's printout.
Thanks.
Um, how is he?
He's asleep.
Then we'll be going!
Excuse us!
Shouldn't you check up on him?
Nah, it's fine.
What was that for, you moron?!
I'm seriously gonna kill you!
What? I didn't kick you that hard.
Why is it always just you?!
No one comes to visit me!
Tomoko, it's for you!
I-It was just a deliveryman from Sagawa!
Hey, what are you doing?!
Let me cry under your blanket!
Maybe I'll catch a cold since it's full of germs!
I don't have anything to do.I'm borrowing some games.
What do you think you're doing here?
Get away from me, you biohazard!
I've pretty much recovered, you know.
Shut up!
I nursed you all day and I still didn't catch your cold, you piece of trash!
Thanks to you, I had to go to goddamn school today!
Take these and get the hell out!
You know,
you don't feel the effects of a cold immediately after you catch it.
It takes a while before the symptoms appear.
U-Um...
Nurse m—
Damn it, my weekend is ruined—
I-I should check up on some wikis at least.
I got a text... from Yuu-chan.
You have a cold.Stay out of my room.
You can't get sick again so soon.
That's not the problem.
Oh, so you feel awkwardaround your own sister?
You see me as a woman?
You think I'm feminine?
Did the feverfry your brain?
Does this look right?
Move it up and to the right a bit.
Okay.
I've bought the boards!
Quit wasting time! Tomorrow's the big day!
Sure...
Try not to mess up!
Don't worry! I got this!
Done!
Oh, it looks good!
Wow, you're pretty good at this!
Too bad people only noticeyou're around at times like this.
What's 
Huh? Where's Nozomi's group?
They went somewhere.
I made copies of the flyers andwanted to ask them to cut them up.
What about those guys?They don't look busy to me.
Yeah...
Those two haven't done a thing this whole time.
Huh?
U-Um...
Uh...
It's fine! No need to force yourself.
We'll get those guys to do it.
Yeah.
Um... I don't really have anything to do...
And I'm really good at...
...cutting stuff up.
Thanks for volunteering, then.
Just cut these up like this, and then...
Um...
We were told to help.
We're cutting these into fours?
I think so.
Guys, come here so we can do the costume fitting.
Wow, there's a ton of them!
Where did you get all of these?
I borrowed some of them from my friends, some were Drama Club leftovers, and some I bought myself.
Guys, you can get changed over there.
Crossdress and go hand out flyers!
As maids? Are you serious?!
I-I'm...
I'm sorry.
Nah, it was my fault.
Blood...
There's blood on it.
Don't worry about that!
You need to see the nurse!
Good thing it wasn't anything serious.
I-I'm sorry.
It was my fault for being in such a rush.
W-Well...
Um...
I'm fine, really.
Are you a first-year?
Y-Yes...
F-From Class 10.
Class 1-10...
You guys are doing a cosplay cafe, right?
I'm the chair of the fair committee!
I-I see...
Anyway, I've got stuff to do.
Th-Thank... you.
Earthlings, widows, and superhumans!
Dance like you've gone insane!
I just can't seem to connect with Kuroki-san.
Yeah, you never know what she's thinking.
Why would she even join ifshe can't play an instrument?
She's a nice girl, though.
This is a notice from the fair executives.
We are setting up the chairsfor the events in the gym
Please come and help if you are free.
Thank you for helping!
Thanks so much!
Kuroki-san, right?
You helped too?
Y-Yeah.
S-Sort of.
Even though you're hurt? Thank you.
O-Oh, it's no big deal.
Let's make this a fun cultural fair, okay?
O-Okay...
Great!
Well, thanks again!
Hello? Yuu-chan?
Yeah, at the cultural fair tomorrow...
Cute?
Nah, no way! Totally not!
Everyone was so enthusiastic, I worked way harder to help than I needed to!
It sounds fun?
I dunno...
You'll come?!
I have all my shifts on the first day, and only the second day is open to the public...
Oh, you'll come on the second day?
Okay, I'll be waiting.
See ya.
Welcome!
What would you like?
Hurry up and wash the cups!
R-Right...
Man, we're in trouble now!
Would you like some octopus dumplings?
The Woodwind Club's performance will soon be starting in the gym.
The Light Music Club is up next.
Guys and girls! Let's raise the roof!
Hey! Are you fired up yet?
I threw up all the octopus dumplings...
Kuroki-san!
Taking a break?
I-I just...
All my shifts are tomorrow, so I had nothing to do...
Bye!
Man!
So many people stopped by,I thought I was gonna die!
When should we meet tomorrow?
This slut is my friend!
Okay, I'll be waiting in my classroom.
Balloons!
Yay! Thanks!
Thanks!
Bye-bye!
Morning!
Today's the day, huh?
Good luck!
Let's enjoy the cultural fair!
Th-Th... anks...
Is the water boiling yet?
I'll check.
I might even be able to enjoy the fair with her around.
Y-Yuu-chan!
Oh, Mokocchi!
I missed you so much!
Oh, uh...
Me too.
By the way, why aren't you in your costume today?
L-Let's go outside for now!
See you around, Yuu.
We're off to see our friends as well.
Okay, later!
So where should we go?
Hmm, well...
Let's just walk around.
Yuu-chan!
Whoa!
It looks better than the one we did in junior high.
S-Since we're already here, wanna go in?
It's so scary!
Don't worry. I'm right here.
You're looking for Kuroki-san?
Did she take any shifts?
Dunno.
Okay, thanks.
It wasn't that scary, huh?
R-Right.
Huh? Mokocchi?
I bought these!
Eat up.
They're all on me.
Okay, wait just a second.
I'll go get some food too!
It's fine! Don't mind me!
I'm stuffed. You can have this.
Oh, I watched the anime you told me about.
What'd you think?
I haven't seen the whole thing yet,but I'm really enjoying it.
I didn't expect that girl to die so early in the series.
Yeah, that's where it gets interesting.
They're making movies out of it, too.
Really?
Then let's go watch them together!
Yeah, let's.
I can't wait!
Hello?
Yeah... Yeah.
You're leaving?
Okay.
Are you still in the school?
Okay.
Okay, I got it.
There they are.
Mokocchi, I had fun today.
Thanks for showing me around.
Anytime. I had fun, too.
I'll call you later.
Yeah. See ya.
It's so hot in this!
You did a good job!
Thanks.
There are still balloons left.
Yeah.
Can I borrow this real quick?
Sure, but it'll wrinkle your uniform.
This is a notice from the fair executives.
The Firefly Light Fair will be closing soon.
Thank you all for coming today.
Hey.
What?
How long do you plan oncontinuing these talks?
Wasn't it just training?
It's about time...
Finally got tired of them?
About time I showed offhow much I've grown!
I'm at the end of myrope in many ways.
Start by learning how topay attention to others!
Take that!
In other words, you're an alien?
Yes.
You're here to invade Earth?
Yes.
Oh come on, jokes like thatshould stay in elementary school.
First of all, do you really think there are people who'd unquestioningly believe someone
who says out of the blue,"I'm an alien from another planet"?
I told you to be careful about this.
If she starts calling you"Little Miss Weirdo" or something...
Tomoko, want some tea?
Hey.
What happened to my sports drink?
The one I had chilling in the fridge.
I drank it.
Then apologize.
Sorry.
You aren't sorry at all, are you?
I am.
Wow, they're seriously moving!
This is crazy!
It's awesome!
So gross!
It's true! They're moving!
My turn next.
Whoa, it's moving around!
Really? Lemme see!
Okay, pair up and take turns using the courts.
Okay!
Wanna pair up?
Sure.
Let's have a match.
Okay, let's use that court.
The losers have to treat the winners to lunch!
Oh, come on!
I'm going to serve now!
Okay!
Crap, I forgot to bring my lunch!
I'm starving!
Sandwiches again?
Your lunch looks good.
Let's share.
This place...
Welcome.
What would you like?
Oh, um...
You'd like a cappuccino?
What size would you like?
Yes?
Giant.
U-Um...
Oh, you mean "Grande"?
Certainly.
Here you go.
A-Are you all right?
I like you better when yousmile and cry like a human being.
Thank you.
You gotta be kidding me.
Who's that in this photo sticker?
She's really cute.
My friend from cram school.
She already has a boyfriend, though.
Aw, man!
Cheer up!
But man, those funny faces here look really ugly.
Hey, who're you calling "ugly"?!
Just kidding. It's cute.
Yeah, they're pretty good.
No more looking for you two!
Geez, seriously!
Photo stickers...
Just kidding. It's cute.
Yeah, they're pretty good.
Hello, Yuu-chan?
Are you free tomorrow or the day after?
Oh, I see.
Nah, don't worry. It's nothing serious.
What do you want?
If it's not important...
Take it.
It's to make up for the sports drink I took the other day.
By the way, wanna go takesome photo stickers tomorrow?
Nope.
It's a chance to be photographedwith your dear sister.
They're stickers, you know.
Didn't you use to like them?
I even ran out to buy this for you.
Get out.
Where do you wanna go next?
Wanna get some crepes?
Insert coins to start.
Let's begin taking the photos!
Follow my lead and strike some cute poses!
Let's start with a peace sign tomake your face look more petite!
Here we go!
Five, four, three, two, one...
Okay, that's a cute picture!
Let's try a duckface next!
D-Duckface?!
Now for a heart pose!
Next, stick your tongue out for a playful look!
The last shot will be a full-body one!
Give me a super happy smile!
400 yen...
Okay, we're here at the studio.
As you can see, there's not a cloud in the sky.
So you're saying the key to successisn't looks, but conversational skills?
That's right.
Having the conversational skills to keep your customers interested is the most important thing.
You'll be surprised to hear that I was terrible at speaking with people before I entered this profession.
Then how did you acquire your current conversational skills?
It's thanks to my job.
I learned it all through my work.
It changed me.
Thank you very much!
That was 3.2 seconds.
Stir with large, circular motionsso your chest is easier to see.
Huh? It's empty?
Where do we keep the sugar again?
Ow...
Hey, miss!
You're gorgeous! Are you a model?
I've got a great job for you thatpays a lot with short working hours.
Oh, you're on your way to work?
See ya!
You there. Got a moment?
You're adorable! You a model?
I've got a great job for you.
Aw, don't ignore me.
You're hurting my feelings.
Hey there, mister.
You interested in some DVDs?
I've got some rare uncensored stuff...
Hey, Tomoko?
Why aren't you home yet?
M-Mom...
Didn't I tell you this morning?
Someone gave us some beef,so we're having sukiyaki tonight.
What's wrong? You have stuff to do at school?
Nah, I'm about to head home.
Could you buy some eggs on the way back, then?
It'd be bad if we didn't have enough.
Take care and come home quickly.
Yeah, I'll be home soon.
You just can't beatstaying at home.
Summer break's coming up.
You can stay at homeall you want then.
Crap!
Huh?
That means thefirst term's about to end!
I haven't accomplishedanything yet!
So?What did you just say?
I said, Kii-chan will be here soon.
Your younger cousin.
Wha—
She visits us every summer, remember?
They should be here this afternoon,
so make sure you clean up your room.
Coz, could you tell me about your boyfriend?
I met him at cram school.
He's a year older than me and in high school.
All he does these days is bug me for sex.
It's getting kinda annoying.
Really?
I keep telling him that we should wait until I'm in high school.
You're amazing, Coz!
You're smart and popular with guys!
You're so cool!
Not at all.
M-Man, we do the dirty every day.
Wow.
Mommy, how much longer until we're at Coz's place?
Oh? Really looking forward to it, huh?
Yeah!
Coz's stories are awesome!
Really?
Sorry, I'm on the train right now.
Yeah.
I'm with some friends.
Oh, I see.
Nah, don't worry about it.
I'm actually pretty busy too.
See you.
Stop that!
This is the cutest thing!
These would look so cute together, right?
Yeah, way cute!
They'd 
Man, we do the dirty, like, every day.
Wow.
I'm gonna vacuum your room.
Step out for a bit.
Give me that! I'll vacuum the room myself!
All right! This is working!
Done vacuuming?
What did you do?!
Did you really use the vacuum cleaner on yourself?!
Well, uh...
What if those marks don't go away?!
But, like...
You're always pulling such stupid stunts!
Honestly...
At any rate, Kii-chan and your aunt will be here soon.
Put something with sleeves on!
Geez, what on Earth were you thinking?!
Come on, hurry—
Just shut the hell up!
I'll do whatever I want!
Get out!
Welcome, Kii-chan!
Ooh, did you get taller?
Yes, I've grown four centimeters!
I'm still short compared to my classmates, though.
Is that so?
Well, who knows? You might be taller than me by next year!
U-Um, is Coz here?
Yes, but uh...
What's wrong?
Coz, what's that?
Oh, you noticed?
It's a hickey.
I wasn't talking about that.
Thanks for coming with me to the library, Coz.
O-Oh, it's nothing!
You wouldn't be able to get there by yourself,
and there's no escaping summer homework.
You know...
I'd love for you to tell me more stories when we're back home.
About your boyfriend and stuff!
O-Oh look, there's the library!
I'll be waiting over there.
Lemme know when you've found a book.
Yep, thanks!
Oh, I remember you!
Y-You're talking to 
You don't remember?
That rainy day at the park.
Did you use the umbrella I left for you?
It's just a cheap one from the convenience store, though...
though... though... though...
M-Money for... the umbrella...
O-Oh, it's fine.
It was just 300 yen.
I-I'll buy you something.
Really, don't worry about it.
Oh right, I still don't know your name.
Mine's Kosaka.
T-To... mo... moko... K-Kuroki.
So, uh...
Momoko-chan?
Momoko-chan?
Momoko-chan?
Momoko-chan!
Momoko-chan!
Momoko-chan.
Momoko-chan!
He even used the "chan" honorific!
Y-Yes... well... uh...
That's right.
I'm Momoko.
I'll have to live with him calling me "Momoko"!
Momoko!
Oh, right!
We first met at the park,so you live close by, right?
Y-Yeah, right n—
Y-Yes. It's about ten minutes on foot.
I live nearby too, so I come here often.
I have entrance exams next year.
R-Really?
All right, I need to get back to studying.
Well, see you later.
Coz!
I think I'll borrow this book.
R-Really?
Let's get it checked out, then.
Okay!
Coz, who were you talking to in the library?
When I came back, you were talking with a guy.
Y-You saw?
Is he the boyfriend you told me about?
Yeah.
Ooh, I knew it!
So he's the guy you started dating in junior high? The one who kept bugging you for sex?
Y-Yeah, that's him!
Anyway, almost done with your homework?
I can help you out!
Then let's go back and return that book tomorrow!
Okay! Thanks!
See you later... see you later... see you later...
Coz...
Um, is that really okay?
He seemed a bit too friendly with that girl.
O-Oh, it's fine.
Th-The two of us have apretty open kind of relationship!
Coz...
Like I said, if you use this equation here...
U-Um...
Um!
H-Huh?
U-Um...
I don't think you should be so friendly withanother girl when you're already dating Coz.
Coz? Who's that?
My cousin Tomoko!
Tomoko?
Uh...
A-Are you just using Coz for sex?!
Hey, wait a minute!
Coz always talks about you so happily...
Coz!
Oh, you're the girl from yesterday.
I-I have some things to say to him,
so could you go wait somewhere else?
Sure.
Um, what's going on?
Uh...
Coz...
Sorry I took so long, Kii-chan.
Man, 
He's such a player, seriously!
Oh?
H-Huh?
Kii-chan, did you see something?
No, I didn't.
I-I see.
No, I didn't.
Kii-chan, wanna go to this cool placetomorrow? I'll treat you.
Cool place?
"Cool place"...
K-Kii-chan.
I can buy you about ten DelishSticks, so no need to hold back.
Right...
So, Kii-chan.
Y-You see, people play this card game here.
Th-This is last year's rankings.
B-By the way, "Queen" happens to be...
Ooh, it's Queen!
It's been so long, Queen!
W-Well, I'm Queen.
Wow! So she's Queen?!
I haven't seen you since last summer, Queen.
Queen, you'll play a round, right?
Queen, play with me!
Hmm.
Are you ranked?
I just started!
Sorry, I don't play noobs.
Queen lives up to her name!
Queen's so cool!
Awesome!
What should we do, then?
Um...
Who's the strongest here?
Today's strongest player would be...
Yotchan.
Oh?
Let's have a go at it.
So cool!
Her very own deck holster!
Damn, I want one too!
Looks like Queen's gonna lose!
No, Queen always draws apowerful card when she's in trouble!
It's true! She drew a powerful card!
Queen! Queen! Queen!
Queen! Queen! Queen!
Whoa, Yotchan lost!
What a comeback!
Queen's so strong!
Here, Kii-chan.
Th-Thanks.
S-So how was it?
Huh? What?
W-Was I cool?
Coz!
Kii-chan, your mom's here to pick you up.
Okay!
You'll be back for New Year's?
I will!
Come to my place next time, okay?
For you, I'll...
do everything I can to help!
Y-Yeah, thanks.
Did you have fun playing with Tomoko?
Yeah.
Tomoko's really... cute.
What?
I'll have to be really nice to her from now on.
Was it just me?
Instead of looking at me like a puppy would,
I was away on a school trip
Right.
Did she grow at all?
Well, I think she's grownin more ways than one.
Did something happen?
Summer break'salmost over, huh?
Hey, Yuu-chan.
I was just—
What?!
I'm so sorry!
I was really looking forwardto the movies tomorrow...
Mokocchi?
Mokocchi?
Mokocchi?
Yuu-chan, let's play word chain using dirty words.
What?!
I'll start.
Let's see...
Shaft.
Uh, uhh...
Um...
T... T...
Titties!
Mokocchi?
Mokocchi, can you hear me?
O-Oh, yeah.
I have to go help out atmy uncle's cafe starting tomorrow.
A-A cafe?
Yeah.
His staff are all coming downwith the summer cold,
so he needs all the help he can get.
Oh, I see...
Sorry for calling it off at the last minute.
I'll treat you to some cake as an apology,
so how about dropping by the cafe tomorrow or the day after?
Uh... Sure.
I'll go the day after tomorrow.
I can't wait.
So glad to hear that!
I'll be waiting!
Welcome!
Hey.
Thanks for coming, Mokocchi.
Mokocchi?
Th-That's a cute uniform.
Thanks.
Well then, please sit down.
O-Okay.
Pick whichever one you want.
I told my uncle you were coming.
I'll go with this one, then.
Right away.
Excuse me.
Just a moment!
See you later!
Here's your order.
A Savarin Macédoine with black tea.
Please enjoy, Mokocchi.
O-Okay.
Excuse me!
Coming!
Munch munch...
Munch munch...
Mokocchi!
There's some cream on your cheek.
Th-Thanks.
Sure thing.
I'm home.
Someone who makes cakes?
Yeah. Do you know anyone like that?
What's gotten into you?
Uh...
I'm bored, so I thought I'd look for a part-time job.
Indeed, that might be better than staying at home and doing nothing all summer.
So yeah, I'd love to work for a cake maker.
Cake...
Now that you mention it,I 
Really?!
Please ask if I can help out!
Okay, but don't cause her any trouble.
I promise I'll work hard!
Hurry!
Okay, Tomoko!
I'd like you to put these on the cakes!
Don't worry! It's easy!
Look, like this.
Attention, please.
It is now break time.
C'mon, don't do it there!
Go for the beach instead!
Like, seriously!
So how'd it go yesterday?
It was hopeless! Nothing happened!
Come on, you gotta be kidding me!
Break time is over.
Please return to work.
We have all kinds of goods here today.
Which of them did you like best?
Let's see.
I'd have to say the vacuum cleaner.
Is that so?
I'm actually kind of a slob,
but I think I'd have fun cleaning with that.
Is that so?
Yes.
Oh, our time is almost up.
The summer heat persists into the fall.
We're seeing record high temperatures all over the country today.
It is unbelievably hot in the heart of Tokyo,
with temperatures exceeding 35°C in the afternoon,
making this the 13th Extremely Hot Day this year.
Let's move on to the regional weather forecasts.
When heading out, be sure to stay hydratedand take precautions to avoid getting heatstroke.
Tomoko!
Come over here!
What?
Clean the bathroom.
It's summer break, so you should behelping with the housework.
Besides, you quit your part-time job in a day.
Not like you have anything better to do!
I'm done.
Thanks.
Clean the windows next.
Wait a minute!
What?
What's this, New Year's Eve?
Why clean the house when it's so damn hot?
I clean this house every day, not just on New Year's Eve!
Th-Then make Tomoki do it!
Tomoki's busy!
He's got exams to prepare for!
What?
His exams are ages later.
You used the same excuse last year,and he ended up doing all the housework!
Now it's your turn to return the favor!
B-But...
No buts!
Tomoki does his own housework every single day, you know!
Aren't you his big sister?!
He cleans his own room and evenmakes his own lunches these days!
As for you, you're a girl, but youdon't even clean your own room!
All you do is laze around every day!
Hold it!
You asshole!
Why the hell do you clean your own room?!
Leave that shit to Mom!
Huh?
You even started cooking?!
You like doing chores?
You trying to be some light novel protagonist?!
Are you really that ignorant of a girl's feelings?
You're just gonna respond with "Oh, you said something?"
Whatever. Get out.
How dare you take your big sister for a fool!
Exams my ass!
Clean the damn house!
You don't have to help,
but at least clean up your own things.
Why is this happening to me?
But man, this is a lot.
Trash.
Trash.
Oh?
One, two, one, two!
Trash.
Trash.
Trash.
Guess I'm done.
What's this?
Sis, I found one!
I got it, Sis!
We can sell these for 100 yen each, right?
Yeah!
100 yen, 200 yen, 300 yen, 400 yen!
I'm finally done.
Huh? There's more?
It's his!
I wonder if I can find a superembarrassing composition in here.
My big sister, by Kuroki Tomoki.
I love my sister.
She is kind and always plays with me.
When I am in trouble, she always helps me.
She even helps Mom in my stead.
I really love my big sister!
Huh? Tomoki?
He left not too long ago.
He's going to the observatory with some friends.
The observatory?
Yeah. There'll be a meteor shower tonight, apparently.
Some great news to end the summer with.
Around 10 PM tonight, the Cygnid meteor shower will be visible in most parts of the country.
Many meteors should be observable even to the naked eye in open areas away from city lights.
What are you going to wish for?
Thank you very much.
I'm home.
What the hell?
You left that cicada shellhere, didn't you?
Don't just come intomy room without asking!
Who cares?The new term's starting!
What now?
Like I care.
I want to talkabout that shell—
The cicada shell,
Huh?
Where am I?
Such pretty flowers!
A-A dream?
Thank God.
No, screw God!
How was 
Who the hell gets turned on by bugs?!
That's got to be one of theworst five nightmares I've ever had!
A gorilla!
A crocodile!
Bugs again!
This is bullshit!
I'm about to completely pass out right now.
It's just a small quiz, but try your best.
Hey, Kuroki, are you all right?
Are you feeling si—
Okay! Ten minutes left!
You won't believe what happened.
I got molested on the train this morning.
Seriously?
That happens a lot.
I've already been assaulted twice.
It happened to me right after I started high school.
By the way, there's this one guy whoalways sits next to me on the train home.
What the hell? That's so creepy.
Oh, Mokocchi? What's up?
Y-Yuu-chan, have you ever been molested?
Huh? Why do you ask?
Well, I... uh...
Y-You see...
I was molested today.
Really? Are you okay?
Yeah, all he did was squeeze my butt.
It's nothing.
No, it's not!
S-So that got me wondering if you were all right.
I'm fine. I get on the train with my friends.
But there 
M-Middle school?!
I'm more worried about 
It's dangerous to walk around alone.
Y-Yeah.
Call me if anything happens.
I-I will.
Thanks.
A passenger has pressed the emergency stop button at the Chida-numa station.

Doors are closing.
I-It's a molester!
I'm holding on to his thing!
I-It's still tugging at me...
U-Um...
That's my...
I'm so sorry!
My long sword fell when the train shook, and I was trying to pull it back up.
I'm really sorry!
Oh, Mokocchi?
Yuu-chan...
What's wrong? Did something happen?
Y-You see...
I just got raped by a long sword.
Huh? What do you mean?
Mokocchi?
Hello? Hello?
This swimsuit's super cute!
But isn't it kinda too revealing?
Well, yeah! You're supposed toshow more skin during the summer!
Totally!
Seriously?
I see.
I'm surprised.
That's an impressive price.
I'd expect no less from high school girls.
I almost want to take you in as my underlings.
I'll say just one thing, though.
My panties cost...
5,300 yen!
Hey, Mokocchi?
U-Um...
Y-Yuu-chan...
Yuu-chan, uh...
Wh-What kind of panties are you wearing?
Mokocchi?!
N-Not gonna mess with my skirt.
Mokocchi!
Sorry I took so long!
Yuu-chan—
Oh, this?
Knee socks are what's in at school right now.
Weird, huh?
I-I see.
Your collar's kind of weird, too.
Is that the latest trend?
Um, yeah, I guess.
All the cool kids pop their collars.
Ooh, that's so funny!
"Funny"?!
I've been buying my clothes here recently.
Oh, that's the place!
Wow!
Is everyone here to buy panties?!
And whoa, this shop smells really good!
Maybe it's because the underwear's scented!
Yuu-chan, this smell!
These panties smell like peaches!
Mokocchi, it's just the shop.
Yuu-chan.
What panties do you think would suit me?
Huh?
Just pick something that you'd want me to wear.
I've never thought about something like that before.
Then what panties would you buy for yourself?
I'll just go with that.
Hm, let's see.
I'd go with...
It'd get me so damn hard!
Mokocchi?!
I bought them.
But this is where the 
Oh?
Anyway, for now—
Hey, where'd the cup of noodles on my desk go?
I ate it, obviously! You're dead!
No, 
All right.
I'm handing back the quiz you took the other day.
Whoa, what a silly mistake!
Should've checked my answers!
Your total comes to 6,820 yen.
Give this a shot on your way home.
Congratulations! You've won third prize!
Master...
Okay...
I said that was okay, but...
Oh, it's climax time!
I'm home.
Welcome back.
Is that a cake?
What a surprise!
It was a gift from my client.
How are Tomoko and Tomoki?
Tomoko, there's cake.
Want some?
I'm coming in.
Man, that hit the spot!
It was refreshing!
It brought outthe woman in me!
Or something.
Wanna borrow it?
It's used goods, though.
Don't call it that!
Oh, c'mon.
Hello, everyone!
Today's "Let's Play" will be about this dating sim for girls.
Y'know, I actually play a lot of that sort of dating sim.
Surprising, huh?
Don't you agree?
Oh look, it's a super handsome guy!
He looks just like me!
Wait, da hell?!
I'll take this one.
Thank you.
Please don't be mad. Hear me out.
We're throwing a party at our club tonight.
It's called The Flying Club.
We'd really like you to come.
The guy with glasses is such a player.
Totally unlikeable.
So damn noisy!
That night, he left some red wine outside the room
and waited for the victim to open the door.
In other words, the culprit is...
He was turned into a kidbut got to keep his adult mind?
That's pretty awesome.
Oh?
Where are you from, little lamb?
What's wrong?
Poison Mushroom Detector!
What have you invented this time?
If you get lost in the mountains, this baby will help you recognize poisonous mushrooms!
Not this again, Kiteretsu.
What does "lick-lick" mean?
No one's responding.
I don't have a single reason to go outside.
Oh, what happened to going to the beach?
Canceled, because Nishioka wanted to come too.
We can just go to the pool, then.
I don't mind either way.
But man, I bet that stuff about being a surfer's a load of bull.
Yeah, he's way too pale.
That's what I'm saying!
Oh, I play the winner!
Okay.
How many times have you—
I'm scared! I'm scared! I'm scared!
Why does tomorrow have to come so soon?
Why? Why?!
Somebody, anybody!
Please come and save me!
Somebody, anybody!
Shut up!
"How to enjoy summer break alone."
Fireworks? Been there, done that.
Camping? Nope.
Bugs'll eat me alive.
The pool?
What's this, spiritual training?
Here's your package.
Thank you! Have a nice day!
I-I need a mask.
Yeah, I should wear a mask.
I mean, I'm not ready to reveal my face to the Internet. It's too scary.
I'm home.
All right. I should be good to go.
Finally, I can...
Wait.
What should I talk about?
U-Uh, hello.
A-Am I nervous?
N-No, of course not!
Something... something?
Something...
Y-You want to know 
U-Uh...
I had noodles today, noodles yesterday, noodles the day before...
An endless noodle cycle!
Just kidding...
Um...
U-Uh...
Nope.
Can't do it.
"This is a live post-recording event where your requested line will be read to you."
"Feel free to bring and use your own recording device."
Live post-recording... Feel free to record!
But...
Please.
Come with me to the bathroom!
I can't hold it in anymore!
You've gotta be kidding me.
Look at the time.
You're not going to help me?
I'll go ahead and open my feminine floodgates right here, then.
What are you talking about?
I'm gonna pee right here.
Don't you dare!
All right. Let's head back.
Wait. I want to take a quick shower.
Just shower tomorrow!
Come on. I only need a quick rinse.
I also need a change of underwear, so come with me to my dresser.
Does that mean...
It leaked out a bit.
Got a problem?
I reacted 
Man...
I couldn't sleep yesterday because I have way too many things I want him to say.
I only slept for eight hours.
That's more than enough sleep!
Thank you for coming.
I love you, Tomoko.
Next, please.
Coming.
Thank you so much!
Um, there's a line I want you to say.
Let's hear it.
Um...
Say "I'm gonna make a real mess out of you," please!
Sure.
I'm gonna make a real mess out of you.
Thank you so much!
Next, please.
O-Okay.
Thank you for coming on such a hot day.
Um, a handshake?
O-Oh, right.
Please let me know what line you'd like me to say.
Tomoko, your body's so warm.
You dirty bitch.
Just kidding. I won't let go.
Teacher, won't you sign this?
Scum. You dare defy me?
Would you die with me?
Just kidding.
You try too hard.
Watch your step. Here, take my hand.
Together... just like this...
Sniff, sniff...
Your hair's silky and smells really good.
To tell you the truth, I've always loved...
You stink.
Get away from me.
Tomoko, Tomoko...
Tomo—
"You stink, you bitch in heat."
"Just kidding. It was a joke."
"To tell you the truth, Tomoko, your hair smells really good."
"And look, it's really silky too."
"I love you!"
All that, please!
Understood.
Um, thank you.
You bitch in heat, you smell really good.
I love you.
You bitch in heat, you smell really good.
I love you.
You bitch in heat, you smell really good.
I love you.
Tomoko, your hair's so silky.
It smells really good.
No.
I'll end up in a different world at this rate.
I should play a dating sim andbuild on this bliss while it lasts.
That's it!
And
So hot...
Oh, welcome back.
You're home early today.
Sis! Sis!
What, Tomo-kun?
What are you watching?
I found it while I was cleaning the house.
Brings back memories, doesn't it?
Okay!
I love you, Sis!
I love you too, Tomo-kun!
When I grow up,
I'm gonna marry you, Sis!
You can't.
Brothers and sisters can't marry each other.
Sis, I wanna kiss!
Okay! Smooch!
Sis, I wanna pee!
Geez, Tomo-kun...
It's done!
Let's give it a listen.
Hey, you awake?
You bitch in heat.
I'm gonna lock you up in here forever.
Let me go.
I hate you.
What a naughty girl.
This is what you deserve.
No.
Tomoko, it's dinnertime.
Oh, you're alone?
Where's Tomoki?
I thought I heard someone talking...
How does it feel to have your freedom taken away by the guy you hate?
Untie me.
Hey, where are you touching—
Tomoko, your hair smells really good.
No, stop.
Stop smelling me.
We'll be together forever.
Together forever.
You'll never leave this place.
I love you, Tomoko.
Y-You lie.
Prove it.
Just kidding. It was a joke.
How could you lie to me?
You're horrible.
You're a horrible man.
You stink.
Oh, stop.
Don't be so rough.
I love you, Tomoko.
Stop, stop. No more of your lies.
Dinner's ready, so come down whenever.
It's fine. No need to worry.
Cheer up.
I'm here with you.
I bought some fireworks.
Let's light them together.
Huh?
People don't normally do that.
Oh.
People don't 
Well, I'll give you some ice cream, so just watch me light them.
What should I do?
About what?
It's already August!
A third of mysummer break's gone!
You still havetwo-thirds of it left.
You think that's a lot?
You're a winner at life wholives his days to the fullest?
Go to hell!
Unpogirls...
I see.
So they're ugly pigs who are unpopular with guys?
What class do we have next?
Uh... English.
Huh?
Here.
Sorry, I forgot my textbook at home.
Guess what!
That's just so weird!
I dunno!
I printed out the photo we tookwhen we all
Ugh, this picture looks weird.
Come on, I look so bad in this!
Hang on, didn't you two hook up after that?
See you later, teacher!
See you. Exams are coming up,so don't forget to study hard!
Okay!
So, have you studied at all?
Haven't read a word!
I knew it! Neither have I!
Kuroki, you're so smart!
Can you explain this to me?
Oh, this one?
Hey!
How about studying together at a family restaurant?
Sure, sounds good.
Huh? You two are going together?
We're going too!
Seriously?
Do you mind?
Totally not up for cram school right now.
Wanna skip together?
Way too risky.
How about meeting up later?
Sure!
Only after getting showered in acid, of course.
Goodbye, teacher!
Careful on the way home!
Kuroki, be careful on the way home.
See you!
Tomoko!
I'm going grocery shopping. What do you wanna eat?
Twice-cooked pork.
Okay. I'll be off then!
So bitter.
Hey, long time no see.
Sorry about that.
I... I wanted to see you too.
The dialog so far has gone just fine.
Now I'll just take the leap...
Coming...
I'm coming soon—
Whoa, who's that pretty girl?
She's so hot, she should be recognized for it!
Oh, I know!
Greater! Greater heights!
I want guys... boys to look at me!
I'm home.
Welcome back.
Whoa, who's this freaking ugly chick?!
Oh, it's just you, Sis?
Hey, lil' bro, let's talk!
Huh?
Who said you could come in?
Why are you getting all comfy?
Who cares? I'm your sister.
Wanna play PES for a change?
No. Get out.
You didn't have club practice today?
We're on a break because of the exams. Get out.
Um...
Stop poking around my stuff!
Go kill yourself!
Okay, then.
I'll commit suicide.
Wait a second...
You were just kind of annoying.
It's, uh...
I've been thinking, you know...
Ever since I got into high school, it felt like the difficulty level got bumped up to hard mode.
Then if I enter university and continue on with life, it'll turn into nightmare mode.
Maybe going for a quick ending would be smarter.
My bad. Calm down.
You wanted something from me, right? What is it?
Talk to me.
Huh? You serious?
I just noticed that I haven't talked with anyone lately.
Now I can't talk with anyone outside the family.
Why?
I don't know!
Help me get better! Talk to me for an hour every day!
I don't really get it. Why don't you talk with your friends instead?
You really think I have friends?
I can't imagine someone having absolutely no friends.
I see that playing on thesoccer team as a regular member
since your second year has made you quite different from me, sir.
Isn't it like, you know...
If you score a goal in a game,
don't you also score with one of the team's female managers?
That's not soccer anymore!
So? Will you talk with me?
Decide already,
or I'll kill myself.
If she were a boy, I would'vepunched her in the face by now.
For how long?
Until I can make a fri—no, a boyfriend.
That sounds like a life sentence to me.
Nah, I think a month will be enough.
So, you want to talk?
Am I cute? 
You're normal.
What's normal?
Above average? Below average? Average average?
Or how is it? I don't know what normal means to you...
Phew, exams are finally over.
Now we get the rest of the day off.Wanna go somewhere?
Hey!
We're going to karaoke. Wanna come?
Totally!
Okay, I'll sing AK* then!
G-G... Goodbye.
Yeah. Careful on your way home.
Welcome.
Your total comes to 256 yen.
Would you like spoons with that?
Y-Yeah.
Then I'll put them in.
Uh... Thanks...
Welcome!
Sorry! Did I make you wait long?
You're so late.
So sorry!
Let's go!
I'm sorry! I hope you aren't mad.
Welcome!
Will your order be for here or to go?
I-I would... like...
...to eat here.
May I take your order?
O-One hamburger.
Will that be everything?
Y-Yes, and some, uh, water or...
Excuse me?
N-No, nothing.
Man, I really sang my heart out.
Oh, some people left?
So there's eight of us?
We can all sit down here.
Yay, lucky!
I'm taking this seat!
I'll sit here.
Isn't she from our class?
Isn't she always alone?
She's alone even here? Poor girl.
You'll never believe this! I had towait a whole hour in line to eat it!
Seriously?
How about eating there together sometime?
That sounds nice!
Sure!
When should we go?
What's up?
Well, that's our uniform.
Someone you know?
Nah. So where were we?
We were deciding when to go.
What are you standing here for? Get going!
What?
That chick was so freaking ugly.
Didn't you see her too, Tomoki?
N-No, I didn't look.
You missed out! It's rare to see someone 
Let's go home. No detours.
Okay.
So, uh, how long areyou gonna stay here?
I had a friend, too,up until junior high.
Right.
I'm thinking aboutgiving her a call.
You do that.
I will.
Just don't do it here.
For this problem, you should usethe formula I taught you the other day.
It'll be on the exam, so make sure you remember it.
All right!
One-two! One-two!
Goodbye, teacher!
Careful on the way home!
Kuroki, careful on the way home.
G-G-Goodbye.
Yeah. See you tomorrow.
Before high school started,I had thought I'd be having more fun.
We were going so fast!
You handled it pretty well, Tomo-chan.
Yeah.
We'd save more time if we headed overto Mammoth Future next.
Really?
I honestly have no idea where we are right now.
We're so lucky to be in your group, Tomo-chan!
Yeah!
Okay, let's get going!
Hey, wait!
Hang on, Tomo-chan!
If you can't keep up, I'll leave you behind!
Geez!
Hurry up!
Wait!
Tomo-chan, what perfume are you wearing?
Huh? I'm not wearing any.
Really? But you smell so nice.
Yeah!
Something just smelled like my grandpa's house.
Yeah. It reminded 
I thought I'd be having lots of fun...
I shouldn't have tried to recall all of that!
My life was flashing before my eyes like some near death experience!
What's up, Mokocchi?
Future plans?
Dunno yet.
Your school's already asking youto think about that?
Wow...
Yeah.
Yep, liberal arts for me.
Oh right, your dream for the future was
to become an arms dealer, right?
Back in junior high, you said...
I'm gonna be the first female arms dealer in Japan!
Arms dealer?
You were always reading up on stuff about weapons during breaks.
I'd totally ship a ton of RPGs to that conflict zone.
I didn't really get it, but you knew so much about them.
I seriously doubt there are any eighth graders who know as much about anti-materiel rifles as I do.
Are there?
You also often said...
If I want to become a global arms dealer,I'll have to pick my bodyguards carefully as well.
Del** Force, Navy SE**s, or the SA* I guess.
You often mumbled to yourself.
At the time, I thought you were amazing.
I didn't think a junior high studentcould have such clear goals for the future.
Huh?
What's wrong, Mokocchi?
Feeling sick?
Oh, that's all right.
Take care of yourself.
I want to leave the past behind, butwhy does it keep trying to ruin my life?!
I hope the remaining one third of the year will fly by
so that my past will beforever lost to oblivion!
And Yuu-chan had such horrible grades!
Why is her memory so good when it comes to this stuff?
Damn it!
The past doesn't really matter.
Yeah.
The present and the future are what's important!
We've been having these talks for over half a year now,
but I don't think I've improved at all.
Right.
Then how about we sto—
So like...
After quite a bit of thought,I realized that you're my little brother.
What a revelation that must've been.
We're family, so we obviously share our childhood—our past.
And aren't we sharing our time even now?
If this is gonna take a while,then get out of my room right now.
But I'm going to focus on the future from now on.
My little brother is underqualified.
Hah!
A lot of people use "overqualified"to mean the same thing, but it's wrong.
So?
What do you want?
You want me to spell it out for you?
I want you to relieve me from these talks.
Sorry.
If you want to talk again sometime, I might bein the mood to play along once in a while.
Like you weren't talking to yourself the entire time anyway.
Hey!
Don't you have anything to say?
Thanks, lil' bro.
I don't need you anymore.
Imae-san!
What's up?
Okay, got it.
I'll try talking to him, too.
Really?
Yep, it shouldn't be a problem.
Just leave it to me!
Thanks a lot! You're an angel!
You're exaggerating.
See you!
Bye!
Morning!
Morning.
I talked it over with Imae-san,and she said she'll ask the teacher for us.
Really?
She's so dependable!
Yeah, she's wonderful.
She never boasts about her gradeseven though she's the top of her year,
and she's always so cheerful.
Few people are as loved byboth boys and girls as she is.
Teacher...
What is it?
Oh, that totally slipped my mind.
I need to switch themwith the first years' portraits.
Oh my, you forgot?
I'm sorry.
I'll switch them today.
Thank you!
Let me know if you need any help.
Did you watch last night's Abe Talk?
Crap, I haven't filled out my future plans survey yet.
I have!
I put "businessman" as my second choice!
Oh? So what's your first?
"Hero"!
Have you tried that new thing at Burger Queen?
Yeah, I have.
Wasn't there like way too much sauce?
You thought so too?
For this problem, you should use thegrammar rule I taught you the other day.
Make sure you memorize it for the exam.
A cockroach!
It's huge!
Stay away from me!
Not here!
Awesome!
Kuroki-san, you're so cool!
Kuroki! Kuroki!
Ku—
Huh?
Uh...
You should go wash your shoe.
Hey, can I copy your homework?
Again?
Did you hear?
Oikawa-san's dating Hashiba-senpai from the baseball team!
I'm so tired...
Are you guys retarded?
Why won't you talk about Kuroki, the hero who saved the class?
You're wasting your lives talking about dumb crap.
Like, Kuroki-san's quiet, but something's off about her.
Who would step on it?
Could you even say she's got guts?
It creeped me out.
I was so surprised! She just went and squished it!
Stop! I don't want to experience it again!
I'm serious!
Natsumi said she saw them flirting on the train!
Natsumi? Really?
Keep it down, or else the teacher next door will show up.
Hey, let's hang out after school.
Sure. Where do you wanna go?
Let's see... I think...
U-Um...
U-Um...
Oh!
What's wrong?
Was that a first year?
Yeah. Her name's Kuroki-san.
Isn't she kinda cute?
You think so?
She always seems to be trying really hard.
It's like I can't take my eyes off her.
Mokocchi?
Ooh, a cat!
Tomoko! Tomoki!
Dinnertime!
"Miss-fit"?
Tomoko! Come down or we'll start without you!
Coming!
Seriously, what trivial stuff.
Episode 6 ED4 Karaoke
I've always had my eyes on you, Tomoko.
You are my soulmate.
For you, my one true love in this world, I'll...
I love you.
All right!
Ow!
I was right.
Romance is all about how far you'll go to prove your love. 
And finding a person who's worth the effort is pure luck.
Like, just gotta wait for the right hurricane to sweep you off your feet.
Anyway, women shine brightest when they find their one true love.
Morning.
Good morning.
Oh my...
What's up?
You look kinda cheerful this morning.
Something good happen to you?
Hey, what should we do over summer vacation?
Girl, we gotta hit up the beach. 
I wanna go on a camping trip!
Hang on. Isn't the fireworks festival on the same day of the closing ceremony?
Oh, then let's kill some time at a karaoke box before we go check it out.
Karaoke? Sounds good to me!
She said she studied and all that!
How pathetic.
Like, totally! Right?
Yeah.
And guess what?
What?
Like, she got remedial anyway.
What? Like, seriously? Like, totally lame, girl.
Actually,
I bet Miho's got a boyfriend now.
Yeah, she, like, totally changed just like that.
Totally.
Guess girls really do get prettier when they're in love.
Got that right.
This will work.
Forgive me.
You'll have the best of luck today!
Black's your lucky color.
Every inch of you will make those of the opposite sex react in all kinds of ways!
Black, huh?
All right.
You're free to do whatever you want in PE today.
Okay!
Here I come!
Take that!
Oh, my bad.
Later.
Today, we'll review the idiomatic usage of auxilary verbs.
You might recall seeing questions about them during your semester finals.
Let's start with...
or this?
Hey.
Huh?!
Y-Yes?
Sorry. Forget about it.
Oh, okay.
We'll be stopping for about two minutes to let the express train pass.
Being a teenager is awesome!
Hey there, li'l bro!
Jesus Christ, that's gross!
You've always been—
You are my soul—
For you, my—
I love you.
I knew it. Dating the same guy forever is a snoozefest.
He'll keep saying the same things,
and keep loving you the same way.
It's like an endless cycle of sea breezes and land breezes.
I guess a good woman needs to exprerience not just one, but all kinds of love.
Listen up.
I can understand you're all excited,
but don't go too wild and get into trouble, okay?
See you next semester.
Dismissed!
What?
Weren't we gonna go karaoke before the fireworks tonight?
But, like, I wanna put on a yukata.
Hey, that sounds good.
Guess karaoke'll be a sausage fest, then.
Shut up already!
That
has
I-Isn—
Yui!
You guys are late!
Sorry about that!
Got held up by Risa.
I don't think we're gonna make it to the mixer.
We still have half an hour. That's plenty.
Actually, it's better to make 'em wait.
Now then.
Hello!
Yeah, I'm at school now!
What? You can't come and watch the fireworks today?!
Y-You're awful!
I was really looking forward to this, you know!
Screw you!
Goodbye!
I hope someone—
I really don't care who it is.
That'd make me so happy!
Mokocchi, that's dangerous!
Nah, this is nothing.
I bet I'd be able to see some of the fireworks show from here.
Dude, someone's here already.
What now?
Um...
Yes?
Can I... s-stay?
Can I watch it with you?
Huh?
If you don't want me around, I'll leave.
So...
Uh...
Sure.
It's not like we own the place.
Thank you.
Huh?
Oh shit! The penthouse window's wide open today!
H-Huh?
Make sure to keep your head down, okay?
O-Okay.
U-Um...
Hey, hey!
Huh? What?
Take a look at that!
They're getting 
Whoa! You don't find that stuff in otome games!
Hey! Keep it down! They'll hear you!
The ass?!
Summer vacation starts tomorrow.
I bet you went and saw the fireworks with yukata-clad girls.
I did.
We went as a big group of boys and girls.
A cheery social gathering, huh?
Huh?
Just you watch.
By the time summer vacation ends, 
What the hell is her problem?
A new school term.
A new phase. A new stage.
Everything up until now was just a warm-up.
The tutorial, if this were a game.
The real deal starts here!
We're changing seats after just one term?
Hurray! I get to sit at the very back!
Man, I've got 
Give me a break.
I'm here too!
Crap, I'm stuck with this annoying group?
Says the biggest pain in the neck.
Come on—
Hope we get along, Kuroki-san.
Wow, that's the first timeI talked to you, Kuroki-san!
And you're already annoying her.
You might as well ask her out on a date!
Not a bad idea!
You're taking it way too far!
I have to spend the whole term in this seat?!
All of you will now...
...fight to the death.
All right, settle down!
Homeroom's starting!
Come at me.
Wild, isn't it?
Nico Nico Douga!
Man, the noodle sandwiches were sold out!
You must really like them.
Then when are you gonna eat it? Now?
All right.
A head was drawn there in chalk!
Seriously?
When did you dream that?
It's true! I swear!
Man, I'm so tired!
From the roof all the way to the first floor! Unbelievable!
Why would they keep them there?
I know, right?
Pass!
Here I go!
Nice shot!
Teams C and D are up next!
Kuroki-san?!
Teacher!
It's only a mild case of anemia.
She just needs to rest.
That's good.
I-I'm sorry.
Try not to skip your meals.
Right.
Take care on your way home.
G-Goodbye.
Yeah, see you!
Got it!
Just a little more...
Let's just give up.
We've used enough coins already.
We were so close.
Mom, look at that!
Isn't that cute?
I want one like that!
It's so big!
Wanna eat some donuts?
You're the only first-year class that hasn't decided yet!
Make up your minds today. Got it?
Yes.
Day duty, the greeting.
Goodbye.
Yeah, goodbye.
Today? So we can't leaveuntil we've picked something?
I heard that Class 1 is already staying after school today to prepare.
Really?
They're way too fired up.
Let's just decide already.
I suggested the maid cafe.
Classes 2 and 6 are already doing that,
and so are some second and third year classes.
What's with this shitty drawing?
Don't ask me.
Urgh, this doll's made of real hair! Yuck!
Ew, you're right! Gross!
Who made it?
Mokocchi...
Then how about cosplay?
We could get stuff from ***ki.
Anything food-related would work.
I've got an idea! How about naked waiters?
You've gotta be kidding!
Here you go.
What?
Man, I made eye contact with that chick outside.
So what?
Let's just get stuff ready for the fair.
I'll make some tea.
Tomoko!
Tomoko! Dinnertime!
What are you doing?
Come down when I call you!
Dinner's ready. Now come downstairs.
Let's decide on the menu first.
We can get coffee in bulk at lower prices there.
We should also do toast and pizza.
They're easy.
Wait, about this cosplay... Do the guys do it too?
How about crossdressing, then?
Gross!
Don't you just wannanuke the whole fair?
Why's that?
The whole thing'sjust pretense!
It's a collective delusionof small-minded
accomplishment andmomentary unity!
I can't say that'sinaccurate...
Right?
...but that's a rathertwisted perspective.
